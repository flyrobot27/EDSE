Fulham F.C.

Fulham Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Fulham">Fulham</a>, Greater London, England. The team competes in the , the top level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. They have played home games at <a href="Craven%20Cottage">Craven Cottage</a> since 1896, other than a two-year period spent at <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a> whilst Craven Cottage underwent redevelopments that were completed in 2004. They contest <a href="West%20London%20derby">West London derby</a> rivalries with <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> and <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>. The club adopted a white shirt and black shorts as its kit in 1903, which has been used ever since.
Founded in 1879, they are London's oldest professional football club. They joined the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> in 1898 and won two First Division titles (1905–06 and 1906–07), as well as two Second Division titles and a <a href="Western%20Football%20League">Western League</a> title. Elected into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> of the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1907, Fulham would win the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> in 1931–32, four years after being relegated. They won the Second Division title in 1948–49, though were relegated after three seasons. Promoted back to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> again in 1958–59, the form of star player <a href="Johnny%20Haynes">Johnny Haynes</a> helped Fulham to remain in the top-flight until consecutive relegations occurred by 1969. They were promoted in 1970–71 and went on to reach the <a href="1975%20FA%20Cup%20final">final</a> of the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20FA%20Cup">1974–75 FA Cup</a>.
Fulham drifted between the second and fourth tiers until being taken over by <a href="Mohamed%20Al-Fayed">Mohamed Al-Fayed</a> in 1997. They went on to win two divisional titles in three seasons to reach the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> by 2001. They won the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a> in <a href="2002%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">2002</a> and were beaten in the <a href="2010%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">2010</a> final of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>. However, thirteen consecutive seasons in the top-flight culminated in relegation in 2014. Since that time, the club have moved between the first and second tiers under new owner <a href="Shahid%20Khan">Shahid Khan</a>. Fulham had changed divisions in five successive seasons between 2017–18 to 2021–22, being relegated after winning the <a href="2018%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">2018</a> and <a href="2020%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">2020</a> EFL Championship play-off finals. They then won the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20EFL%20Championship">2021–22 EFL Championship</a> title, finally settling in the Premier League, where they have played since 2022.
History.
1879–1907: Formation and Southern League years.
Fulham were formed in 1879 as Fulham St Andrew's Church Sunday School F.C., founded by worshippers (mostly adept at cricket) at the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> on Star Road, <a href="Kensington">West Kensington</a> (St Andrew's, Fulham Fields). Fulham's mother church still stands today with a plaque commemorating the team's foundation. They won the West London Amateur Cup in 1887 and, having shortened the name from Fulham St Andrews to its present form in December 1888, they then won the <a href="West%20London%20League">West London League</a> in 1893 at the first attempt. One of the club's first ever kits was half red, half white shirts with white shorts worn in the <a href="1886%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1886–87 season</a>. Fulham started playing at their current ground at <a href="Craven%20Cottage">Craven Cottage</a> in 1896, their first game against now defunct rivals <a href="Minerva%20F.C.">Minerva</a>. Fulham are one of the oldest established clubs in southern England currently playing professional football, though there are many non-league sides like Kent side <a href="Cray%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Cray Wanderers</a> who are several decades older.
The club gained professional status on 12 December 1898, the same year that they were admitted into the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>'s Second Division. They were the third club from London to turn professional, following <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, then named Royal Arsenal 1891, and <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> in 1893. They adopted a red and white kit during the <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1896–97 season</a>. In <a href="1902%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">1902–03</a>, the club won promotion from this division, entering the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League First Division</a>. The club's first recorded all-white club kit came in 1903, and ever since then the club has been playing in all-white shirts and black shorts, with socks going through various evolutions of black and/or white, but are now normally white-only. The club won the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> twice, in 1905–06 and 1906–07.
1907–1949: Football League.
Fulham joined <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> after the second of their Southern League triumphs. The club's first league game, playing in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>'s <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football%23Second%20Division">1907–08 season</a>, saw them lose 1–0 at home to <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> in September 1907. The first win came a few days later at <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>'s <a href="Baseball%20Ground">Baseball Ground</a> by a score line of 1–0. Fulham finished the season three points short of promotion in fourth place. The club progressed all the way to the semi-final of that season's <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, a run that included an 8–3 away win at <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>. In the semi-final, however, they were heavily beaten, 6–0, by <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. This is still a record loss for an FA Cup semi-final game. Two years later, the club won the London Challenge Cup in the <a href="1909%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">1909–10 season</a>. Fulham's first season in Division Two turned out to be the highest that the club would finish for 21 years, until in <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20in%20English%20football">1927–28</a> when the club were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">3rd Division South</a>, created in 1920. <a href="Hussein%20Hegazi">Hussein Hegazi</a>, an Egyptian forward, was one of the first non-British players to appear in The Football League, though he only played one game for Fulham in 1911, marked with a goal, afterwards playing for non-league <a href="Dulwich%20Hamlet%20F.C.">Dulwich Hamlet</a>.
During this period, businessman and politician <a href="Henry%20Norris%20%28businessman%29">Henry Norris</a> was the club chairman and curiously he had an indirect role in the foundation of Fulham's local rivals <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. When he rejected an offer from businessman <a href="Gus%20Mears">Gus Mears</a> to move Fulham to land where the present-day Chelsea stadium <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a> is situated, Mears decided to create his own team to occupy the ground. In 1910, Norris started to combine his role at Fulham with the chairmanship of Arsenal. Fulham became the first British team to sell <a href="hot%20dog">hot dog</a>s at their ground in 1926. Fulham had several high-profile international players during the 1920s, including <a href="Len%20Oliver%20%28footballer%29">Len Oliver</a> and <a href="Albert%20Barrett">Albert Barrett</a>.
After finishing fifth, seventh and ninth (out of 22 teams) in their first three seasons in the Third Division South, Fulham won the division in the <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20in%20English%20football">1931–32 season</a>. In doing so they beat <a href="Torquay%20United%20F.C.">Torquay United</a> 10–2, won 24 out of 42 games and scored 111 goals, thus being promoted back to the Second Division. The <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20in%20English%20football">next season</a> they missed out on a second consecutive promotion, finishing third behind <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a>. A mixed bag of league performances followed, although the club also reached another FA Cup semi-final during the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20in%20English%20football">1935–36 season</a>. Fulham were also to draw with Austria in 1936 before <a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>. On 8 October 1938, Craven Cottage saw its all-time highest attendance at a match against <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>, with a crowd of 49,335 watching the game.
League and cup football were severely disrupted by the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in 1939, with the Football League split into regional divisions temporarily, with a national <a href="Football%20League%20War%20Cup">Football League War Cup</a> and a <a href="London%20War%20Cup">London War Cup</a> up for grabs. Craven Cottage was used like many grounds for fitness and training of the army youth reserves. Post-war, a full league programme was only restored for <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20in%20English%20football">1946–47</a>. In <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20in%20English%20football">the third season</a> of what is now considered the modern era of football, Fulham finished top of the Second Division, with a win–loss–draw record of 24–9–9 (identical to that which won them the Third Division South 17 years previously). <a href="John%20Fox%20Watson">John Fox Watson</a> made a pioneering transfer to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> in 1948, becoming one of the first players from the United Kingdom to sign for a high-profile side abroad.
1949–1970: First Division Cottagers.
Promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">top tier</a> of English football saw the club perform poorly, finishing 17th in their first year and 18th in their second. In only their third season of First Division football, Fulham finished rock bottom of the 22-team league in the <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20in%20English%20football">1951–52 season</a>, winning only eight of 42 games. On 20 May 1951, Fulham played one of their first ever games in North America in an exhibition match against <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> at <a href="Delorimier%20Stadium">Delorimier Stadium</a> in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> in front of 29,000 spectators.
Possibly the single most influential character in Fulham's history is <a href="Johnny%20Haynes">Johnny Haynes</a>. "Mr. Fulham" or "The Maestro," as Haynes later came to be known, signed for The Cottagers as a schoolboy in 1950, making his first team debut on Boxing Day against <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> at Craven Cottage in the 1951/52 relegation season. Haynes played for another 18 years, notching 657 appearances (along with many other club records too), his last appearance for Fulham coming on 17 January 1970. He is often considered as the greatest player in Fulham history, and never played for another team in Britain. He gained 56 <a href="cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a> for England (22 as captain), with many being earned while playing for Fulham in the Second Division. Haynes was injured in a car accident in <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> in 1962, but by his own admissions never regained the fitness or form to play for England again, missing out on England's victory in the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%201966">FIFA World Cup 1966</a> for which he would have stood a chance of being selected. The Stevenage Road Stand was renamed in his honour after his death in a car crash in 2005.
Fulham reached the <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20FA%20Cup">1957–58 FA Cup</a> semi-finals, the best cup run of Haynes' career and nearest he came to a major trophy win playing in England. They were eliminated in a replay by the remnants of <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a>'s <a href="Busby%20Babes">Busby Babes</a> team that had been decimated in the <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a> the month before. United were the first top division team Fulham played in that cup run. Fulham won promotion back to the First Division in the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">following season</a> by finishing second to <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>. Also joining Fulham in 1958 was <a href="Graham%20Leggat">Graham Leggat</a>, who went on to score 134 goals in 277 appearances, (making him the club's fifth all-time top scorer). In the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20in%20English%20football">1959–60 season</a>, they achieved tenth position in the First Division, which until finishing ninth in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FA%20Premier%20League">2003–04 season</a> was their highest-ever league position. This accompanied another appearance in the last four of the FA Cup in 1962.
By this time, the club were regularly playing in front of 30,000 plus crowds at Craven Cottage, despite struggling in the league.
The club earned a reputation for constantly battling against relegation most seasons, with numerous narrow escapes; none more so than in <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20in%20English%20football">1965–66</a>. On the morning of 26 February 1966, Fulham were bottom with just 15 points from 29 matches. The last 13 games saw Fulham win nine and draw two to reach safety. Eventually, however, the club suffered relegation in the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20in%20English%20football">1967–68 season</a>, having won just ten out of their 42 games. Even that, however, was not as catastrophic as the calamity of next season. Winning only seven in 42, the club were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>.
1970–1994: Mixed fortunes outside the top flight.
The aforementioned Third Division hiatus lasted only two seasons before the club was promoted back to the Second Division as runners-up in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">1970–71</a>. This spell also saw Fulham invited to the <a href="Anglo-Italian%20Cup">Anglo-Italian Cup</a>, which saw the club draw four out of four games in 1972–73 season. This preceded a period of high-profile signings for the club under <a href="Alec%20Stock">Alec Stock</a> in the mid-1970s, including <a href="Alan%20Mullery">Alan Mullery</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a>. Fulham reached their only FA Cup final to date in 1975, having won their first semi-final in five attempts. The club lost 2–0 to <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in the <a href="1975%20FA%20Cup%20final">final</a> at Wembley Stadium. This gained the club qualification for another European tournament, the <a href="Anglo-Scottish%20Cup">Anglo-Scottish Cup</a>, where they reached the final, losing to <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>.
<a href="George%20Best">George Best</a> played 47 times for the club in the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77 season</a>. <a href="Rodney%20Marsh">Rodney Marsh</a>, who having grown up with Fulham in the 1960s went on to play First Division football and play for England, rejoined the club in the same season, playing only 16 games. This capped one of the most successful eras in Fulham history.
The club were relegated again after winning only 11 in 42 matches in the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20in%20English%20football">1979–80 season</a>, which eventually resulted in <a href="Bobby%20Campbell%20%28English%20footballer%29">Bobby Campbell</a>'s dismissal in October 1980, to be replaced by <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a>. With a strong squad during his 1980–1984 period in charge (with players such as <a href="Ray%20Houghton">Ray Houghton</a>, <a href="Tony%20Gale">Tony Gale</a>, <a href="Paul%20Parker%20%28footballer%29">Paul Parker</a>, <a href="Gerry%20Peyton">Gerry Peyton</a> and <a href="Ray%20Lewington">Ray Lewington</a>), they won promotion again in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20in%20English%20football">1981–82</a> back to the Second Division, although the promotion was overshadowed by the suicide of former defender <a href="Dave%20Clement">Dave Clement</a> a few weeks before promotion was sealed.
In 1980, Fulham founded the rugby league club that is now <a href="London%20Broncos">London Broncos</a> designed to be an extra stream of income for the football club, but which made financial losses every year while linked to Fulham F.C. Then called "Fulham Rugby League," they played at Craven Cottage until moving away from the parent club in 1984.
In 1978, Fulham had signed Gordon "Ivor" Davies who, during two spells at Fulham, became the club's leading goalscorer of all time with a total of 178 goals in all competitions; the record still stands. Fulham narrowly missed out on back-to-back promotions to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, losing 1–0 to Derby County away on the last day of the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1982–83 season</a> – although the match was abandoned after 88 minutes due to a <a href="pitch%20invasion">pitch invasion</a> and inexplicably never replayed or finished. The side which had shown so much promise was quickly sold off as the club were in debt, so it was little surprise when the club were relegated again to the Third Division in 1986. The club nearly went out of business in 1987 via an ill-advised merger attempt with <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>. It was only the intervention of ex-player <a href="Jimmy%20Hill">Jimmy Hill</a> that allowed the club to stay in business by formation of a new company, Fulham FC (1987) Ltd. In 1987, the club took part in what was then the longest penalty deciders ever recorded – it needed 28 spot kicks to sort out a winner between them and <a href="Aldershot%20F.C.">Aldershot</a> following a <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> match.
In 1992, the foundation of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, and the resignation of 22 clubs from The Football League, restored Fulham to that league's Second Division. However, the club were relegated to the new Third Division after a poor <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94 season</a>, following which <a href="Ian%20Branfoot">Ian Branfoot</a> was appointed as team manager.
1994–1997: Fulham's lowest ebb.
After an eighth-place finish in Branfoot's <a href="1994-95%20in%20English%20football">first season</a> in charge, the club hit its lowest-ever final league position in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96</a> season, finishing 17th out of 24.<ref name="Final 1994/1995 Football League Two Table"></ref><ref name="Final 1995/1996 Football League Two Table"></ref> Branfoot was dismissed as manager, but remained at the club in other capacities for a short while. In February 1996, <a href="Micky%20Adams">Micky Adams</a> became <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a>. Adams oversaw an upturn in form that lifted the side out of relegation danger. The next season, he engineered a second-place league finish, missing out on first place because several years previously the league had dropped the old "goal difference" system in favour of a "goals scored" tally, meaning Fulham finished behind <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>. The club's chairman Jimmy Hill had argued in 1992 that goals scored should decide places of teams tied on points, and the Football League clubs had voted the system in.
1997–2001: Al-Fayed takeover.
Egyptian businessman <a href="Mohamed%20Al-Fayed">Mohamed Al-Fayed</a> bought the club for £6.25 million in the summer of 1997. The club was purchased via Bill Muddyman's Muddyman Group. Al-Fayed had Micky Adams replaced in the aftermath of a mid-table start to the season. He installed a two-tier management "dream team" of <a href="Ray%20Wilkins">Ray Wilkins</a> as First Team Manager and <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a> as chief operating officer, pledging that the club would reach the Premier League within five years. After an argument over team selection, Wilkins left the club in May 1998 to hand over the full managerial duties to Keegan. Keegan then helped steer the club to promotion the next season, winning 101 points out of a possible 138, after spending £1.1 million to sign <a href="Paul%20Peschisolido">Paul Peschisolido</a> from <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. Peschisolido was top scorer and captained by <a href="Chris%20Coleman%20%28footballer%29">Chris Coleman</a> – then the most expensive footballer outside the top two divisions of the English league.
In 1999, Keegan left Fulham to become manager of England, and <a href="Paul%20Bracewell">Paul Bracewell</a> was put in charge.
Bracewell was dismissed in March 2000, as Fulham's promising early season form dwindled away to a mid-table finish. Frenchman <a href="Jean%20Tigana">Jean Tigana</a> was put in charge and, having signed a number of young stars (including French striker <a href="Louis%20Saha">Louis Saha</a>), he guided Fulham to their third promotion in five seasons in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football%23Football%20League%20First%20Division">2000–01 season</a>, giving Fulham top-flight status for the first time since 1968. Fulham once again amassed 101 points out of a possible 138 in their scintillating title run, which was crowned with an open-top bus parade down Fulham Palace Road. They are the only team to have twice reached 100 points in a season. During the season, Chris Coleman was involved in a car crash that put him out of action for well over a year and eventually ended his playing career after he failed to make a sufficient recovery. Fulham's run through the divisions saw a large turnover of players, with the only player to play for the club in all four leagues being <a href="Sean%20Davis%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201979%29">Sean Davis</a>.
2001–2007: Early Premier League years.
Fulham returned to the top division of English football, and competed in the Premier League for the first time. The club finished the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20FA%20Premier%20League">2001–02 season</a> in 13th place. Fulham were the only team to host top-flight football with some standing areas in the 21st century, but due to <a href="Taylor%20report">restrictions on standing</a>, this was not allowed to continue; clubs promoted from the second division had only three years to make their ground all-seater. Fulham were forced to <a href="groundshare">groundshare</a> with QPR at <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a> during the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons while Craven Cottage was rebuilt as an all-seated stadium. There were fears that Fulham would not return to the Cottage, after it was revealed that Al-Fayed had sold the first right to build on the ground to a property development firm.
In <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League">2002–03</a>, Fulham spent most of the season in the lower half of the table. Chairman Al-Fayed told manager Jean Tigana that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. However, with five games left to play and relegation still possible, Tigana was dismissed, and Chris Coleman was temporarily put in charge. Fulham won 10 points from a possible 15 and managed to avoid relegation. Coleman was appointed manager on a permanent basis in the summer of 2003; despite predictions that the inexperience of Coleman would result in Fulham's relegation, he kept the club well clear of relegation, guiding them to a club record ninth-place finish <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FA%20Premier%20League">in his debut season</a>. This might have been greater had the club not come under significant financial pressure to sell Louis Saha to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, for whom they received a club record £13 million.
Fulham lost a legal case against former manager Tigana in 2004 after Al-Fayed wrongly alleged that Tigana had overpaid more than £7 million for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret.
Coleman notched up another satisfactory performance in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Premier%20League">2004–05 season</a> and guided Fulham to a secure 13th-place finish. The following season Fulham improved by one place, finishing 12th – the high point of the season was a 1–0 win over local rivals and reigning champions Chelsea in the <a href="West%20London%20derby">West London derby</a> – Chelsea had only lost two games in two and a half years. The <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20FA%20Premier%20League">2006–07 season</a> proved to be Coleman's last, as on 10 April 2007, Fulham terminated his contract with immediate effect. His replacement was <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland</a> manager <a href="Lawrie%20Sanchez">Lawrie Sanchez</a>. Fulham only gained four points from five games with Sanchez as caretaker manager. They ensured top-flight survival that season by defeating a weakened <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> side 1–0 in the penultimate match of the season, and Sanchez was appointed manager.
2007–2010: Hodgson's transformation.
Sanchez received strong financial backing from the board and made a number of signings during the summer break, but, after just two league wins in the first five months of the season and with Fulham in the relegation zone, he was dismissed on 21 December 2007 after a defeat to Newcastle United. <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a> was named as the new manager of Fulham on 28 December 2007 and took up his contractual duties on 30 December, just two days before the January transfer window opened.
Hodgson's tenure did not start well and it took a month to secure his first win, against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, courtesy of a <a href="Jimmy%20Bullard">Jimmy Bullard</a> free-kick. Fulham continued to struggle and a 3–1 home defeat in April at the hands of fellow strugglers <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> left Hodgson on the verge of tears in the post-match press conference and many pundits writing off Fulham's survival chances. Despite the negative press, Hodgson continued to believe survival was attainable. The turning point of the season came in the third-to-last match, against <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Fulham trailed 2–0 at half-time and had the Premier League scores at that time become results, they would have been relegated. However, the introduction of <a href="Diomansy%20Kamara">Diomansy Kamara</a> heralded the start of a fantastic comeback—Kamara struck twice as Fulham registered an amazing 3–2 victory. Fulham then won a crucial match against fellow strugglers <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> at Craven Cottage, leaving survival in the club's own hands. Barring a goal-rush from fellow strugglers <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>, a win against a <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> side looking ahead to their fourth FA Cup final would guarantee survival.
With 15 minutes to play at Portsmouth, Fulham were drawing, and with Birmingham City and Reading leading comfortably against <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> and Derby County respectively, they looked likely to be relegated. However, Fulham earned a free-kick with 76 minutes played; Jimmy Bullard's delivery found <a href="Danny%20Murphy%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201977%29">Danny Murphy</a>, who headed home the decisive goal, sparking manic celebrations from the travelling fans. Hodgson had ensured survival against all odds, breaking several club records in the process and cementing his place in Fulham folklore. Fulham narrowly missed out on a <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> place via <a href="UEFA%20Fair%20Play%20ranking">Fairplay</a> by a dubious 0.8 of a point behind Manchester City, who lost 8–1 at Middlesbrough.
In the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Premier%20League">2008–09 season</a>, Fulham finished seventh, their highest-ever league placing, earning qualification for the inaugural <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>, the second time that the club had entered a UEFA competition.
<a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Premier%20League">2009–10</a> was arguably the most successful season in the club's history. They were eliminated from the FA Cup in the quarter-finals for the second year running, and finished 12th in the Premier League, despite fielding weakened teams in the last few matches. In the inaugural <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League season</a>, however, Fulham reached the final, meeting Spanish club <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, who had dropped down from the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, at the <a href="Volksparkstadion">Volksparkstadion</a> in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. In their first European cup final, the Cottagers were beaten 2–1 after extra time, having drawn 1–1 after full-time. The achievement of taking Fulham so unexpectedly far, beating famous teams like <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>, <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, holders <a href="FC%20Shakhtar%20Donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a> and <a href="FC%20Basel">Basel</a> in the competition, led to Roy Hodgson being voted the <a href="LMA%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year">LMA Manager of the Year</a> by the widest margin in the history of the award. The home match in the round of 16 was arguably Fulham's greatest result in the history of the club. Despite losing 3–1 in the first leg at Italian giants Juventus and falling behind minutes into the second leg at Craven Cottage, Fulham scored four goals with no reply from Juventus.
At the end of the season, Hodgson left Fulham to manage Liverpool.
2010–2013: Established in the Premier League.
On 29 July 2010, <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a> was named the successor to Hodgson, signing a two-year contract with the club. Hughes had previously managed Manchester City, the <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Welsh national team</a> and Blackburn. Hughes' first match in charge was against <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> at the <a href="Reebok%20Stadium">Reebok Stadium</a>. The highlight of the season was a 4–0 win in the FA Cup over London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, all goals coming in the first half. Hughes resigned as manager of Fulham on 2 June 2011, having spent fewer than 11 months at the club. The Whites had an encouraging finish in eighth position and qualified for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> via Fairplay.
On 7 June 2011, <a href="Martin%20Jol">Martin Jol</a> signed a two-year contract with Fulham, becoming successor to Hughes. Jol's first match was a 3–0 Europa League win against <a href="NS%C3%8D%20Runav%C3%ADk">NSÍ Runavík</a> of the Faroe Islands on 30 June. Fulham then navigated their way with some ease to the group stage in the Europa League through late summer. However, the Cottagers were knocked out with the last seconds of the group stage matches, <a href="Odense%20Boldklub">Odense Boldklub</a> equalising to make a draw, leaving Fulham in third place, with Polish side <a href="Wis%C5%82a%20Krak%C3%B3w">Wisła Kraków</a> instead progressing to the next round.
Fulham's Premier League form in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Premier%20League">2011–12 season</a> was mixed, with the continuing away-record hangover of previous seasons dragging on. In October 2011, Fulham had an emphatic 6–0 home win over neighbours QPR, with <a href="Andrew%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29">Andrew Johnson</a> scoring a hat-trick for Fulham in the match. The January 2012 transfer window saw <a href="Bobby%20Zamora">Bobby Zamora</a> move over the Hammersmith flyover to Loftus Road, with Russian striker <a href="Pavel%20Pogrebnyak">Pavel Pogrebnyak</a> coming in place from <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>.
The New Year saw two further hat-tricks scored by <a href="Clint%20Dempsey">Clint Dempsey</a>. On 11 February 2012, Progrebnyak scored on his debut in the 2–1 win over Stoke City. In March 2012, a 5–0 win against <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> saw a hat-trick from Pogrebnyak. The Cottagers broke their historic drought on <a href="Merseyside">Merseyside</a> with a 1–0 win over Liverpool at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> on May Day and another win against Sunderland in the last home game meant Fulham were only one point short of equalling their largest points haul in the Premier League, with just one game remaining. However, they failed to achieve this after losing their last game away at Tottenham.
In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Premier%20League">2012–13 season</a>, Fulham ended a seven-match winless run by beating <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a> 3–0 away at the <a href="Liberty%20Stadium">Liberty Stadium</a> on the final game of the season on 19 May 2013. Fulham finished the season in 12th place.
2013–present: Shahid Khan's ownership.
<a href="Shahid%20Khan">Shahid Khan</a> took over as chairman in July 2013, but after a poor start to the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">2013–14 season</a>, having only amassed 10 points from 13 games, Martin Jol was dismissed as manager in December 2013, with <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Meulensteen">René Meulensteen</a> taking charge as head coach. Meulensteen was replaced by <a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a> after just 17 games in charge following no upturn in form, but fortunes did not improve, and Fulham were eventually relegated to the Championship after a 4–1 defeat away to Stoke on 3 May.
Fulham broke the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> transfer record that summer in a restructuring of the squad by Magath, but after a disastrous start to the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Fulham%20F.C.%20season">new season</a>, amassing just one point in seven games, Magath was dismissed in September 2014, with <a href="Kit%20Symons">Kit Symons</a> appointed as caretaker manager. Fulham eventually finished the season in 17th place. The team suffered an inconsistent start to the following season and after a 5–2 loss at home to Birmingham City, and lying in 12th place, Kit Symons was dismissed as manager in November 2015. It paved the way for Serbian <a href="Slavi%C5%A1a%20Jokanovi%C4%87">Slaviša Jokanović</a> to be appointed on 27 December 2015. Fulham's fortunes did not improve greatly following Jokanović's appointment, but the team finished the 2015–16 Championship season in 20th place, avoiding relegation by 11 points.
The 2016–17 season saw huge improvements in both results and performances. Despite an inconsistent start, the team saw a significant improvement from October onwards which saw them secure a 6th-place finish. They entered the <a href="2017%20English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-offs</a>, but lost to Reading 2–1 on aggregate in the semi-final. During this time, club owner Shahid Khan's son <a href="Tony%20Khan">Tony Khan</a> was named as Vice Chairman and Director of Football Operations, and he also holds the roles of General Manager and Sporting Director. Despite a slow start to the following season, the club went on a club-record 23 game unbeaten run in the league which led to a 3rd-place finish, narrowly missing out automatic promotion. The team went on to win the <a href="2018%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">EFL Championship play-off final</a> against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> to return to the Premier League on 26 May 2018.
During the season, the club signed <a href="Aleksandar%20Mitrovi%C4%87">Aleksandar Mitrović</a>, initially on loan until the end of the season. Mitrović would go on to score more than 100 goals for the club, becoming the eighth player in Fulham's history to do so.
Following a poor start to life back in the Premier League, Jokanović was dismissed in November 2018 and replaced with former Leicester manager <a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a>. Results ultimately did not improve under Ranieri, as well as him alienating several key players, and he left the club in February 2019. He was replaced by <a href="Scott%20Parker">Scott Parker</a> as caretaker manager who could not save the club from relegation on 3 April 2019. Parker was appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 10 May 2019. In a season that was interrupted by the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, Parker led the club straight back to the Premier League on 4 August 2020, defeating London rivals Brentford 2–1 in the <a href="2020%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a> after a fourth-place finish. However, the club would once again be relegated after just a single season back in the top flight after a 2–0 defeat to Burnley on 10 May 2021. In the aftermath of relegation, Parker left the club by mutual consent and was replaced by former Everton manager <a href="Marco%20Silva">Marco Silva</a>.
After relegation, Fulham under Silva earned promotion back to the top tier with four games to go, winning the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20EFL%20Championship">2021–22 Championship</a> title.
Fulham started the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Premier%20League">2022–23 Premier League season</a> much better than prior years. At the halfway point, Fulham sat in 6th place, had tallied a 2–1 win over <a href="West%20London%20derby">West London rivals</a> Chelsea, whom they had not defeated in nearly 16 years, and collected a string of four consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since April 1966.
Grounds.
Between the years 1879 and when Fulham had a ground to call their own in 1896, they played at a number of stadiums, only some of which were recorded and this should not be regarded as a full or complete list. Only rivals and former landlords Queens Park Rangers have played at more home stadiums. Some of the early grounds listed below are likely to have been parks and parkland, which have now been developed. Even when the club purchased Craven Cottage and the surrounding land in 1894, they had to wait two years before they could play a game there.
Club identity.
Kit.
Fulham's sponsorship by <a href="Betfair">Betfair</a> in 2002–03 was the first gambling sponsorship in English football, and came before the <a href="Gambling%20Act%202005">Gambling Act 2005</a> permitted the industry to advertise on television and radio; within fifteen years half of Premier League teams were sponsored by such companies.
On 27 July 2021, it was announced that World Mobile would become the official principal partner for the next three years.
In July 2022, it was announced that the gambling company <a href="TGP%20Europe">W88</a> would sponsor the team in a kit deal for the 2022–23 season. The deal saw the betting firm's logo placed on the front of both the men's and women's kit. The confirmation of the deal came during a decrease in gambling sponsors for Premier League teams. In June 2023, it was announced that betting company <a href="SBOBET">SBOBET</a> would replace W88 as the team's main sponsor for the 2023–24 season.
Mascot.
The Fulham <a href="mascot">mascot</a> is Billy the Badger, who was the winning design sent in by Kyle Jackson after an online competition by the club. Billy the Badger wears the number 79 Fulham shirt, in reference to the club's year of founding, 1879. Controversy first surrounded Billy when he tried to cheer up Chelsea manager <a href="Avram%20Grant">Avram Grant</a> during a home match in front of the television cameras. Secondly, Billy was seen on television being sent off during the home game against Aston Villa on 3 February 2008 for break-dancing in the corner of the pitch after the referee had commenced the game. Billy blamed his badger hearing and eyesight for the incident, and apologised to referee <a href="Chris%20Foy%20%28referee%29">Chris Foy</a>. On 11 March 2009, Billy walked across the goal during a match although it was not spotted by the referee. The former mascot for Fulham was Sir Craven of Cottage, the Knight. The cheerleaders were known as the Cravenettes.
Rivalries and supporters.
Fulham fans consider their main rivals to be Chelsea. Despite this fixture not being played that often in the years preceding Fulham's ascent to the top division, this is a clear local derby as Chelsea's ground, <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>, is within Fulham and only 1.8 miles from Craven Cottage.
Fulham consider their secondary rivals to be <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>. Fulham beat QPR twice in the 2011–12 Premier League season. They won 6–0 at Craven Cottage, and also 1–0 away from home at <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a>. The two clubs have played each other several times since in the Championship.
Fulham's third closest rivalry is with <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>, who they defeated 2–1 on 4 August 2020 in the Championship play-off final. Fulham also have rivalries with several other London clubs to a lesser extent, such as <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>.
Outside of London, <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> are still considered rivals to some Fulham supporters despite the two clubs not having played in the same division since the 2000–01 season. Fulham and Gillingham were involved in several ill-tempered matches in the lower leagues, including the death of a Fulham supporter.
Fulham's fan base has fluctuated over the years, with high crowds coinciding with the club's success in the Premier League. Fulham supporters have played a vital role in the club's long term stay at Craven Cottage. When the club moved temporarily to <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a>, a committee known as Back to the Cottage was formed, committed to ensuring the club continued to play at their traditional home. Fulham fans have traditionally come from the Fulham and Hammersmith areas, and also from other areas in South-West London, such as Putney, Richmond, Sutton and Worcester Park.
In July 2012, the club website asked supporters using Facebook and Twitter to pick their best FFC Premier League XI from 2001 to the present. The supporters picked their favourite goalkeeper, full-backs, centre-backs, wingers, centre midfielders and forwards in a classic 4–4–2 formation. In August 2022, the club asked fans for an updated all time Premier League XI as part of the Premier League's 30th anniversary celebrations.
Records and statistics.
Fulham in Europe.
Fulham are a member of the <a href="European%20Club%20Association">European Club Association</a>, having qualified four times for European Competition, firstly the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a> after their inaugural season in the Premier League, then the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> as a result of winning that, and then the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> twice. Fulham are unbeaten at home in European competition, in 23 games, with a record of 17 wins and six draws. In 2010, Fulham reached the <a href="2010%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20final">UEFA Europa League final</a>, which they lost 2–1 to <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>.
Club management.
Managerial history.
Fulham have had 37 managers in 114 years. Prior to the appointment of the first manager at the club (Bradshaw in 1904), the duties normally assigned to a modern-day manager would have been shared between club secretary, captain, and other officials.
Managerial records:
Temporary managers at the club have included:
Ownership.
Fulham Football Club is owned by <a href="Shahid%20Khan">Shahid Khan</a>. Khan completed his purchase of the club from <a href="Mohamed%20Al-Fayed">Mohamed Al-Fayed</a> on 12 July 2013 for a reported £150–200 million.
During his ownership of Fulham, Al-Fayed had provided the club with £187 million in interest-free loans. In March 2011, Fulham posted annual losses of £16.9 million, with Al-Fayed stating that he would "continue to make funds available to achieve our goals both on and off the pitch" and that "the continued success of Fulham and its eventual financial self-sustainability is my priority." Fulham were effectively debt-free as Al-Fayed converted the loans into equity in the club.

Nottingham Forest Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="West%20Bridgford">West Bridgford</a>, <a href="Nottingham%20Urban%20Area">Nottingham</a>, England. The team compete in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the first level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>.
Founded in 1865, Forest have played their home games at the <a href="City%20Ground">City Ground</a> since 1898. Nottingham Forest have won two <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cups</a> (now the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>), being one of six English clubs to have won the European Cup. They have also won one <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>, one <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">League title</a>, two <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, four <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>s, and one <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a>. The club has competed in the top two tiers of English football since its admission to the Football League, with the exception of five seasons in the <a href="EFL%20League%20One">third tier</a>. Its most successful period was under the management of <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a> and <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201928%29">Peter Taylor</a> in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which included back-to-back wins in the then European Cup in <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20European%20Cup">1979</a> and <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20European%20Cup">1980</a>.
In Clough's last decade at the club, the Nottingham Forest team won the <a href="1989%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1989</a> and <a href="1990%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1990</a> League Cups and were losing finalists in the <a href="1991%20FA%20Cup%20final">1991 FA Cup final</a> and <a href="1992%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1992 League Cup final</a>, before relegation from the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Premier%20League">1993</a>. Upon an immediate return, Forest finished third in the Premier League in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Premier%20League">1995</a> before again suffering relegation from the top flight in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Premier%20League">1997</a> and <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Premier%20League">1999</a>. The team returned to the Premier League by winning the <a href="2022%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">play-offs</a> in 2022.
Forest's fiercest rivalry is with <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>, with which club it contests an <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.%E2%80%93Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.%20rivalry">East Midlands derby</a>. The two clubs have met a total of 109 times, with Forest claiming the most victories (43), the longest win streak (5), and the longest unbeaten run (10) which runs from 11 March 2018 to the present day. In 2007 the <a href="Brian%20Clough%20Trophy">Brian Clough Trophy</a> was founded, which has since then been given to the winner of this East Midlands Derby.
History.
19th century.
In 1865 a group of <a href="shinty">shinty</a> players met at the Clinton Arms (now renamed The Playwright) at the junction of Nottingham's Shakespeare Street and North Sherwood Street. J.S. Scrimshaw's proposal to play association football instead was agreed and Nottingham Forest Football Club was formed. It was agreed at the same meeting that the club would purchase twelve tasselled caps coloured '<a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi">Garibaldi</a> Red' (named after the leader of the <a href="Redshirts%20%28Italy%29">Italian 'Redshirts'</a> fighters). Thus the club's official colours were established. Matches were originally played at Forest Racecourse, the presumed source of the word 'Forest' in the team's name.
From 2019 to 2023, Nottingham Forest claimed to be the oldest remaining club in the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a>. In 2019, when <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> were relegated from the league, <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> claimed to be the oldest remaining club, but football historian <a href="Mark%20Metcalf%20%28footballer%29">Mark Metcalf</a> stated that Stoke was formed in 1868, rather than the 1863 date on the club's badge, and therefore Forest was the oldest club. The EFL also stated that Nottingham Forest was the oldest.
Forest's first ever official game was played against <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> taking place on 22 March 1866. On 23 April 1870, when the team played their first game in league play, the steward of the club was John Lymberry and <a href="William%20Henry%20Revis">William Henry Revis</a> scored the first goal. On that day, Revis also won the prize for kicking a football furthest with a kick of 161 feet 8 inches.
In their early years Nottingham Forest were a <a href="multi-sports%20club">multi-sports club</a>. As well as their roots in <a href="bandy">bandy</a> and shinty, Forest's <a href="baseball">baseball</a> club were <a href="Baseball%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British champions</a> in 1899. Forest's charitable approach helped clubs like <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> and <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a> to form. In 1886, Forest donated a set of football kits to help Arsenal establish themselves – the North London team still wear red. Forest also donated shirts to <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> and helped secure a site to play on for Brighton.
In 1878–79 season, Nottingham Forest entered into the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time. Forest beat Notts County 3–1 in the first round at Beeston Cricket Ground before eventually losing 2–1 to Old Etonians in the semi-final.
Nottingham Forest's application was rejected to join the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> at its formation in 1888. Forest instead joined the <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a> in 1889.
They won the competition in 1892 before then entering the Football League. That season they reached and lost in an FA Cup semi-final for the fourth time to date. This time it was to <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion">West Bromwich Albion</a> after a replay.
Nottingham Forest's first FA Cup semi-final win was at the fifth attempt, the <a href="1897%E2%80%9398%20FA%20Cup">1897–98 FA Cup</a> 2–0 replay win against Southampton. The first game was drawn 1–1. <a href="Derby%20County">Derby County</a> beat Nottingham Forest 5–0 five days before the final. Six of the cup final side were rested in that league game. In that <a href="1898%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1898 FA Cup Final</a> at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre%23FA%20Cup%20Finals%20%281895%E2%80%931914%29">Crystal Palace</a> before 62,000 fans, <a href="Willie%20Wragg">Willie Wragg</a> passed a 19th minute free kick to <a href="Arthur%20Capes">Arthur Capes</a>. Capes shot through the defensive wall to score. Derby equalised with a free kick headed home by <a href="Steve%20Bloomer">Steve Bloomer</a> off the underside of the cross bar after 31 minutes. In the 42nd minute <a href="Jack%20Fryer%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201877%29">Jack Fryer</a> was unable to hold a <a href="Charlie%20Richards">Charlie Richards</a> shot giving Capes a tap in for his second goal. Wragg's injury meant Forest had to change their line up with Capes dropping back to midfield. In the 86th minute <a href="John%20Boag%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201874%29">John Boag</a> headed away a corner by Nottingham Forest. <a href="John%20McPherson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201867%29">John McPherson</a> moved in to collect shooting low into the goal to win 3–1.
First half of 20th century.
Forest lost FA Cup semi-finals in 1900 and 1902. They finished fourth in the <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20Football%20League">1900–01 Football League</a> followed with fifth place the season after. The club then started to slide down the table. Forest were relegated for the first time in 1905–06. <a href="Grenville%20Morris">Grenville Morris</a> had his first of five seasons as the club's highest scorer en route to becoming the all-time club highest goalscorer with 213 goals.
Promotion as champions was immediate in 1906–07. The club was relegated a second time to the Second Division in 1911, and had to seek re-election in 1914 after finishing bottom of that tier; as the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> approached it was in serious financial trouble. The outbreak of the War, along with the benevolence of the committee members, prevented the club going under.
In 1919, the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Football League First Division</a> was to be expanded from twenty clubs to twenty-two in time for the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Football%20League">1919–20 Football League</a>: Forest was one of eight clubs to campaign for entry, but received only three votes. Arsenal and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> gained the two additional top tier slots.
In a turnaround from the first six seasons struggling back in the Second Division, Forest were promoted as champions in 1921–22. They survived each of the first two seasons back in the top flight by one position. In the third season after promotion they were relegated as the division's bottom club in 1924–25. They remained in the second tier until relegation in <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20in%20English%20football">1949</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Football League Third Division</a>.
Re-emergence then decline (1950–1974).
They were quickly promoted back two years later as champions, having scored a record 110 goals in the 1950–51 season. They regained First Division status in 1957.
<a href="Johnny%20Quigley">Johnny Quigley</a>'s solitary <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20FA%20Cup">1958–59 FA Cup</a> semi-final goal beat <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. <a href="Billy%20Walker%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201897%29">Billy Walker</a>'s Forest beat <a href="Luton%20Town">Luton Town</a> 2–1 in the <a href="1959%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1959 FA Cup Final</a>. Like in 1898, Forest had lost heavily to their opponents only weeks earlier in the league. <a href="Stewart%20Imlach">Stewart Imlach</a> crossed for a 10th-minute opener by <a href="Roy%20Dwight">Roy Dwight</a> (the cousin of Reg Dwight better known as <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>). <a href="Tommy%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201930%29">Tommy Wilson</a> had Forest 2–0 up after 14 minutes. The game had an unusually large number of stoppages due to injury, particularly to Forest players. This was put down to the lush nature of the Wembley turf. The most notable of these stoppages was Dwight breaking his leg in a 33rd minute tackle with <a href="Brendan%20McNally">Brendan McNally</a>. Forest had been on top until that point. Luton though gradually took control of the match, with <a href="Dave%20Pacey">Dave Pacey</a> scoring midway through the second half. Forest were reduced to nine fit men with ten minutes remaining when <a href="Bill%20Whare">Bill Whare</a> crippled with cramp, became little more than a spectator. Despite late <a href="Allan%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201926%29">Allan Brown</a> and <a href="Billy%20Bingham">Billy Bingham</a> chances <a href="Chick%20Thomson">Chick Thomson</a> conceded no further goals for Forest to beat the <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> 1950s 'hoodoo' (where one team was hampered by losing a player through injury). Club record appearance holder <a href="Bobby%20McKinlay">Bobby McKinlay</a> played in the final winning team captained by <a href="Jack%20Burkitt">Jack Burkitt</a>.
By this time, Forest had replaced Notts County as the biggest club in Nottingham. <a href="Johnny%20Carey">Johnny Carey</a> assembled a team including <a href="Joe%20Baker">Joe Baker</a> and <a href="Ian%20Storey-Moore">Ian Storey-Moore</a> that for a long spell went largely unchanged in challenging for the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Football%20League">1966–67 Football League</a> title. They beat title rivals <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a> 4–1 at the City Ground on 1 October. The 3–0 win against <a href="Aston%20Villa">Aston Villa</a> on 15 April had Forest second in the table, a point behind United. Injuries eventually took effect, meaning Forest had to settle for being League runners-up and losing in the FA Cup semi-final to <a href="Dave%20Mackay">Dave Mackay</a>'s <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a>.
The 1966-67 season's success seemed an opportunity to build upon, with crowds of 40,000 virtually guaranteed at the time. Instead, a mixture at the club of poor football management, the unique committee structure and proud amateurism meant decline after the 1966-67 peak. Forest were relegated from the top flight in 1972. <a href="Matt%20Gillies">Matt Gillies</a>' October 1972 managerial departure was followed by short managerial reigns by Dave Mackay and <a href="Allan%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201926%29">Allan Brown</a>. A 2–0 <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> home defeat by Notts County prompted the committee (Forest had no board of directors then) to sack Brown.
Brian Clough and Peter Taylor (1975–1982).
<a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a> became manager of Forest on 6 January 1975, twelve weeks after the end of his 44-day tenure as manager of <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>. Clough brought <a href="Jimmy%20Gordon%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201915%29">Jimmy Gordon</a> to be his club trainer, as Gordon had been for him at Derby County and Leeds. Scottish centre-forward <a href="Neil%20Martin">Neil Martin</a> scored the only goal in Clough's first game in charge, beating Tottenham Hotspur in an <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20FA%20Cup%23Third%20round%20proper">FA Cup third round replay</a>.
<a href="Ian%20Bowyer">Ian Bowyer</a> was already at Forest and had won domestic and European trophies with <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Clough signed Scots duo <a href="John%20McGovern%20%28footballer%29">John McGovern</a> and <a href="John%20O%27Hare">John O'Hare</a> in February, who both were part of Clough's Derby County <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Football%20League">1971–72 Football League</a> title win. He signed <a href="Colin%20Barrett">Colin Barrett</a> in March, initially on loan. Clough brought <a href="John%20Robertson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201953%29">John Robertson</a> and <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a> back into the fold after they had requested transfers under Brown. <a href="Viv%20Anderson">Viv Anderson</a> had previously debuted for the first team and became a regular under Clough. The young <a href="Tony%20Woodcock%20%28footballer%29">Tony Woodcock</a> was at Forest but was then unrated by Clough and was to be loaned to <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a>. Forest were 13th in English football's second tier when Clough joined. They finished that season 16th. Forest signed <a href="Frank%20Clark%20%28footballer%29">Frank Clark</a> in July of that close season on a free transfer. The season after, Forest finished eighth in Clough's <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Football%20League">1975–76 Football League</a> first full season in charge. It was in this season, McGovern became long-standing club captain, taking over from a game in which <a href="Bob%20Chapman">Bob "Sammy" Chapman</a> and <a href="Liam%20O%27Kane">Liam O'Kane</a> were both injured.
<a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201928%29">Peter Taylor</a> on 16 July 1976 rejoined Clough, becoming his assistant manager, as he had been when winning the league at Derby. Taylor, included being the club's talent spotter in his role. After assessing the players, Taylor told Clough, "that was a feat by you to finish eighth in the Second Division because some of them are only Third Division players". Taylor berated <a href="John%20Robertson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201953%29">John Robertson</a> for allowing himself to become overweight and disillusioned. He got Robertson on a diet and training regime that would help him become a European Cup winner. Taylor turned Woodcock from a reserve midfielder into a 42 cap England striker. In September 1976, he bought striker <a href="Peter%20Withe">Peter Withe</a> to Forest for £43,000, selling him to <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> for £250,000 two years later. Withe was replaced in the starting team by <a href="Garry%20Birtles">Garry Birtles</a> who Taylor had scouted playing for non-league <a href="Long%20Eaton%20United%20F.C.">Long Eaton United</a>. Birtles also went on to represent England. In October 1976 Brian Clough acting on Peter Taylor's advice signed <a href="Larry%20Lloyd">Larry Lloyd</a> for £60,000 after an initial loan period.
Together, Clough and Taylor took Forest to new heights. The first trophy of the Clough and Taylor reign was the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Anglo-Scottish%20Cup">1976–77 Anglo-Scottish Cup</a>. Forest beat <a href="Leyton%20Orient">Orient</a> 5–1 on aggregate in the two-legged final played in December 1976. Clough valued winning a derided trophy as the club's first silverware since 1959. He said, "Those who said it was a nothing trophy were absolutely crackers. We'd won something, and it made all the difference."
On 7 May 1977, <a href="Jon%20Moore">Jon Moore</a>'s own goal meant Forest in their last league game of the season beat <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> 1–0 at the City Ground. This kept Forest in the third promotion spot in the league table and dependent on <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers">Bolton Wanderers</a> dropping points in three games in hand in the fight for third place. On 14 May <a href="Kenny%20Hibbitt">Kenny Hibbitt</a>'s goal from his rehearsed free kick routine with <a href="Willie%20Carr">Willie Carr</a> gave Wolves a 1–0 win at Bolton. Bolton's defeat reached the Forest team mid-air en route to an end of season break in <a href="Mallorca">Mallorca</a>. Forest's third place promotion from the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">1976–77 Football League Second Division</a> was the fifth-lowest points tally of any promoted team in history, 52 (two points for a win in England until 1981).
Taylor secretly followed <a href="Kenny%20Burns">Kenny Burns</a> concluding Burns's reputation as a hard drinker and gambler was exaggerated. Taylor sanctioned his £150,000 July signing. Burns became <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a> in <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Football%20League">1977–78</a> after being moved from centre-forward to centre-back. Forest started their return to the top league campaign with a 3–1 win at <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. Three further wins in league and cup followed without conceding a goal. Then came five early September goals conceded in losing 3–0 at <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> and beating Wolves 3–2 at home. <a href="Peter%20Shilton">Peter Shilton</a> then signed for a record fee for a goalkeeper of £325,000. Taylor reasoned: "Shilton wins you matches." 20-year-old <a href="John%20Middleton%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201956%29">John Middleton</a> was first team goalkeeper pre-Shilton. Middleton later in the month went in part exchange with £25,000 to <a href="Derby%20County">Derby County</a> for <a href="Archie%20Gemmill">Archie Gemmill</a> transferring to Forest. Gemmill was another Scottish former 1972 Derby title winner.
Forest lost only three of their first 16 league games, the last of which was at Leeds United on 19 November 1977. They lost only one further game all season, the 11 March FA Cup sixth round defeat at <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion">West Bromwich Albion</a>. Forest won the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Football%20League">1977–78 Football League</a> seven-points ahead of runners-up <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Forest became one of the few teams (and the most recent team to date) to win the First Division title the season after winning promotion from the Second Division. This made Clough the third of four managers to win the <a href="list%20of%20English%20football%20champions">English league championship</a> with two different clubs. Forest conceded just 24 goals in 42 league games. They beat Liverpool 1–0 in the <a href="1978%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1978 Football League Cup Final</a> replay despite cup-tied Shilton, Gemmill and December signing <a href="David%20Needham">David Needham</a> missing out. <a href="Chris%20Woods">Chris Woods</a> chalked up two clean sheets in the final, covering Shilton's League Cup absence. McGovern missed the replay through injury, meaning Burns lifted the trophy as deputising captain. Robertson's penalty was the only goal of the game.
Forest started season 1978–79 by beating <a href="Ipswich%20Town">Ipswich Town</a> 5–0 for an <a href="FA%20Charity%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a> record winning margin. In the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20European%20Cup">1978–79 European Cup</a> they were drawn to play the trophy winners of the past two seasons, <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Home goals by Birtles and Barrett put Forest through 2–0 on aggregate. 26-year-old Barrett suffered a serious leg injury ten days later against <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> that ultimately ended his professional career two years later. On 9 December 1978, Liverpool ended Forest's 42 match unbeaten league run dating back to November the year before. The unbeaten run was the equivalent of a whole season surpassing the previous record of 35 games held by <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> in 1920/21. The record stood until surpassed by <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in August 2004, a month before Clough's death. <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> played <a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28Arsenal%29">49 league games without defeat</a>.
In February 1979, Taylor authorised the English game's first £1 million transfer signing <a href="Trevor%20Francis">Trevor Francis</a> from <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>. In the European Cup semi-final first leg at home against <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>, Forest were two goals behind after 20 minutes, then scored three to edge ahead before Köln equalised to start the German second leg ahead on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>. <a href="Ian%20Bowyer">Ian Bowyer</a>'s goal in Germany put Forest through. <a href="G%C3%BCnter%20Netzer">Günter Netzer</a> asked afterwards, "Who is this McGovern? I have never heard of him, yet he ran the game." Forest beat <a href="Malm%C3%B6%20FF">Malmö</a> 1–0 in Munich's <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Munich%29">Olympiastadion</a> in the <a href="1979%20European%20Cup%20Final">1979 European Cup Final</a>; Francis, on his European debut, scored with a back post header from Robertson's cross. Forest beat <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> in the final 3–2 to retain the League Cup; Birtles scored twice, as did Woodcock once. Forest finished second in the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Football%20League">1978–79 Football League</a>, eight points behind Liverpool.
Forest declined to play in the home and away <a href="1979%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1979 Intercontinental Cup</a> against Paraguay's <a href="Club%20Olimpia">Club Olimpia</a>. Forest beat <a href="F.C.%20Barcelona">F.C. Barcelona</a> 2–1 on aggregate in the <a href="1979%20European%20Super%20Cup">1979 European Super Cup</a> in January and February 1980, <a href="Charlie%20George">Charlie George</a> scoring the only goal in the home first leg, while Burns scored an equaliser in the return in Spain. In the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Football%20League%20Cup">1979–80 Football League Cup</a> Forest reached a third successive final. A defensive mix up between Needham and Shilton let Wolves' <a href="Andy%20Gray%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201955%29">Andy Gray</a> tap in to an empty net. Forest passed up numerous chances, losing 1–0. In the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20European%20Cup">1979–80 European Cup</a> quarter-final, Forest won 3–1 at <a href="Dinamo%20Berlin">Dinamo Berlin</a> to overturn a 1–0 home defeat. In the semi-final, they beat <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> 2–1 on aggregate. They beat <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburg</a> 1–0 in the <a href="1980%20European%20Cup%20Final">1980 European Cup Final</a> at Madrid's <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> to retain the trophy; after 20 minutes, Robertson scored, after exchanging passes with Birtles, and Forest then defended solidly. Forest finished fifth in the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Football%20League">1979–80 Football League</a>.
In the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20European%20Cup">1980–81 European Cup</a> first round, Forest lost 2–0 on aggregate to 1–0 defeats home and away by CSKA Sofia. McGovern subsequently said the double defeat by CSKA affected the team's self-confidence, in that they had lost out to modestly talented opponents. Forest lost the <a href="1980%20European%20Super%20Cup">1980 European Super Cup</a> on away goals after a 2–2 aggregate draw against <a href="Valencia%20C.F.">Valencia</a>; Bowyer scored both Forest goals in the home first leg. On 11 February 1981, Forest lost 1–0 in the <a href="1980%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1980 Intercontinental Cup</a> against Uruguayan side, <a href="Club%20Nacional%20de%20Football">Club Nacional de Football</a>. The match was played for the first time at the neutral venue <a href="National%20Stadium%20%28Tokyo%2C%201958%29">National Stadium</a> in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> before 62,000 fans.
The league and European Cup winning squad was broken up to capitalise on player sale value. Clough and Taylor both later said this was a mistake. The rebuilt side comprising youngsters and signings such as <a href="Ian%20Wallace%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201956%29">Ian Wallace</a>, <a href="Raimondo%20Ponte">Raimondo Ponte</a> and <a href="Justin%20Fashanu">Justin Fashanu</a> did not challenge for trophies. Taylor said in 1982, 
John McGovern and Peter Shilton transferred and Jimmy Gordon retired in the same close season.
Clough without Taylor (1982–1993).
<a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a> beat Forest in the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20UEFA%20Cup">1983–84 UEFA Cup</a> semi-finals in controversial circumstances. Several contentious refereeing decisions went against Forest. Over a decade later, it emerged that before the match, referee Emilio Guruceta Muro had received a £27,000 "loan" from Anderlecht's chairman <a href="Constant%20Vanden%20Stock">Constant Vanden Stock</a>. Anderlecht went unpunished until 1997, when UEFA banned the club from European competitions for one year. Guruceta Muro died in a car crash in 1987.
Forest beat <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday">Sheffield Wednesday</a> on penalties in the <a href="Football%20League%20Centenary%20Tournament">Football League Centenary Tournament</a> final in April 1988 after drawing 0–0. Forest finished third in the league in 1988 and made the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20FA%20Cup">1987–88 FA Cup</a> semi-finals. <a href="Stuart%20Pearce">Stuart Pearce</a> won the first of his five successive selections for the <a href="PFA%20Team%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Team of the Year</a>.
On 18 January 1989, Clough joined the fray of a City Ground pitch invasion by hitting two of his own team's fans when on the pitch. The football authorities responded with a fine and touchline ban for Clough. The match, against QPR in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>, finished 5–2 to Forest.
Forest beat Everton 4–3 after extra time in the 1989 <a href="Full%20Members%20Cup">Full Members Cup</a> final, then came back to beat Luton Town 3–1 in the <a href="1989%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1989 Football League Cup Final</a>. This set Forest up for a unique treble of domestic cup wins, but tragedy struck a week after the League Cup win. Forest and Liverpool met for the second season in a row in the FA Cup semi-finals. The <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans. The match was abandoned after six minutes. When the emotional replay took place, Forest struggled as Liverpool won 3–1. Despite these trophy wins, and a third-place finish in the First Division, Forest were unable to compete in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, as English clubs were still banned from European competitions following the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20Disaster">Heysel Stadium Disaster</a>. <a href="Des%20Walker">Des Walker</a> won the first of his four successive selections for the PFA Team of the Year.
<a href="Nigel%20Jemson">Nigel Jemson</a> scored as Forest beat <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a> 1–0 to retain the League Cup in 1990. English clubs were re-admitted to Europe for the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">following season</a>, but only in limited numbers, and Forest's League Cup win again did not see them qualify. The only <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> place that season went to league runners-up <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>.
Brian Clough reached his only <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final%201991">FA Cup final</a> in 1991 after countless replays and postponements in the third, fourth and fifth rounds. Up against <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, Forest took the lead from a Pearce free kick, but Spurs equalised to take the game to extra-time, ultimately winning 2–1 after an own goal by Walker. <a href="Roy%20Keane">Roy Keane</a> declared himself fit to play in the final and was selected in preference to <a href="Steve%20Hodge">Steve Hodge</a>; years later, Keane admitted he had not actually been fit to play, hence his insignificant role in the final.
In the summer of 1991, <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>'s league top scorer <a href="Teddy%20Sheringham">Teddy Sheringham</a> became Forest's record signing, for a fee of £2.1 million. <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">That season</a>, Forest beat Southampton 3–2 after extra time in the Full Members Cup final, but lost the <a href="1992%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a> 1-0 to Manchester United thanks to a <a href="Brian%20McClair">Brian McClair</a> goal. This meant that Forest had played in seven domestic cup finals in five seasons, winning five of them. Forest finished eighth in the league that season to earn a place in the new <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a>.
Walker transferred to <a href="Sampdoria">Sampdoria</a> during the summer of 1992. On 16 August 1992, Forest beat Liverpool 1–0 at home in the first-ever Premier League game to be televised live, with Sheringham scoring the only goal of the match. A week later, Sheringham moved to Tottenham. Forest's form slumped, and Brian Clough's 18-year managerial reign ended in May 1993 with Forest relegated from the inaugural <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. The final game of that season was away at Ipswich. Forest lost 2–1 with Clough's son, Nigel, scoring the final goal of his father's reign. Relegation was followed by Keane's £3.75 million British record fee transfer to Manchester United.
Frank Clark (1993–1996).
Frank Clark from Forest's 1979 European Cup winning team returned to the club in May 1993, succeeding Brian Clough as manager. Clark's previous greatest management success was promotion from the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> with <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a> in 1989. Clark convinced Stuart Pearce to remain at the club and also signed <a href="Stan%20Collymore">Stan Collymore</a>, <a href="Lars%20Bohinen">Lars Bohinen</a> and <a href="Colin%20Cooper">Colin Cooper</a>. Clark brought an immediate return to the Premier League when the club finished <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> runners-up at the end of the 1993–94 season.
Forest finished third in <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%201994%E2%80%9395">1994–95</a> and qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> – their first entry to European competition in the post-<a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel</a> era. Collymore then transferred in the 1995–96 close season to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> for a national record fee of £8.5million. Forest reached the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Cup">1995–96 UEFA Cup</a> quarter-finals, the furthest an English team reached in UEFA competition that season. They finished ninth in the league.
The <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%201996%E2%80%9397">1996–97</a> season quickly became a relegation battle. Clark left the club in December.
Stuart Pearce and Dave Bassett (1997–1999).
34-year-old captain <a href="Stuart%20Pearce">Stuart Pearce</a> was installed as player-manager on a temporary basis just before Christmas in 1996 and he inspired a brief upturn in the club's fortunes. However, in March 1997 he was replaced on a permanent basis by <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a> and left the club that summer after 12 years. Forest were unable to avoid relegation and finished the season in bottom place. They won promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt, being crowned Division One champions in 1997–98. Bassett was sacked in January 1999, with <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a> replacing him.
Into the 21st century below the top-flight (1999–2012).
<a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a> was unable to prevent Forest from once again slipping back into Division One, and announced his retirement from football management when Forest's relegation was confirmed on 24 April 1999, with three weeks of the Premier League season still to play.
Former England captain <a href="David%20Platt%20%28footballer%29">David Platt</a> succeeded Atkinson and spent approximately £12 million on players in the space of two seasons, including the Italian veterans <a href="Moreno%20Mannini">Moreno Mannini</a>, <a href="Salvatore%20Matrecano">Salvatore Matrecano</a> and <a href="Gianluca%20Petrachi">Gianluca Petrachi</a>. However, Forest could only finish 14th in Platt's first season and 11th in his second. He departed in July 2001 to manage the <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England U21</a> side and was succeeded by youth team manager <a href="Paul%20Hart">Paul Hart</a>.
 Now faced with huge debts, which reduced Forest's ability to sign new players, they finished 16th in Hart's first season in charge. By December 2001, Forest were reported as losing over £100,000 every week, and their financial outlook was worsened by the collapse of <a href="ITV%20Digital">ITV Digital</a>, which left Forest and many other Football League clubs in severe financial difficulties. Despite the off-field difficulties, Forest finished 2002–03 in sixth place and qualified for the <a href="play-offs">play-offs</a>, where they lost to <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> in the semi-finals. A poor league run the following season, following the loss of several key players, led to the sacking of <a href="Paul%20Hart">Hart</a> in February 2004 with Forest in danger of relegation. The decision was unpopular with certain quarters of the fanbase and Hart was described as a "scapegoat".
<a href="Joe%20Kinnear">Joe Kinnear</a> was subsequently appointed and led the club to a secure 14th place in the final league table. The 2004–05 season saw Forest drop into the relegation zone once more, leading to Kinnear's resignation in December 2004. <a href="Mick%20Harford">Mick Harford</a> took temporary charge of Forest over Christmas, before <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a> was appointed in the new year. Megson had already won two promotions to the Premier League with his previous club <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>, having arrived at the club when they were in danger of going down to Division Two, but failed to stave off relegation as the club ended the season second from bottom in 23rd place, becoming the first European Cup-winners ever to fall into their domestic third division.
In Forest's first season in the English third tier in 54 years, a 3–0 defeat at <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a> in February 2006 led to the departure of Megson by "mutual consent" leaving the club mid-table only four points above the relegation zone. <a href="Frank%20Barlow%20%28footballer%29">Frank Barlow</a> and <a href="Ian%20McParland">Ian McParland</a> took temporary charge for the remainder of the 2005–06 season, engineering a six-match winning run and remaining unbeaten in ten games, the most notable result a 7–1 win over <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a>. Forest took 28 points from a possible 39 under the two, narrowly missing out on a play-off place, as they finished in 7th place.
<a href="Colin%20Calderwood">Colin Calderwood</a>, previously of <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a>, was appointed as Forest's new manager in May 2006. He was their 12th new manager to be appointed since the retirement of Brian Clough 13 years earlier, and went on to become Forest's longest-serving manager since Frank Clark. The Calderwood era was ultimately one of rebuilding, and included the club's first promotion in a decade. In his first season, he led the club to the play-offs, having squandered a 7-point lead at the top of <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a> which had been amassed by November 2006. Forest eventually succumbed to a shock 5–4 aggregate defeat in the semi-finals against <a href="Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.">Yeovil Town</a>; they had taken a 2–0 lead in the first leg at <a href="Huish%20Park">Huish Park</a>, but were then beaten 5–2 on their own soil by the <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> club. Calderwood achieved automatic promotion in his second year at the club, following an impressive run which saw Forest win six out of their last seven games of the season, culminating in a dramatic final 3–2 win against <a href="Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.">Yeovil Town</a> at the <a href="City%20Ground">City Ground</a>. Forest kept a league record of 24 <a href="clean%20sheet">clean sheet</a>s out of 46 games, proving to be the foundation for their return to the second tier of English football and leaving them just one more promotion away from a return to the Premier League.
However, Calderwood's side struggled to adapt to life in the Championship in the <a href="The%20Football%20League%202008%E2%80%9309">2008–09 campaign</a> and having been unable to steer Forest out of the relegation zone, Calderwood was sacked following a <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> 4–2 defeat to the Championship's bottom club <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a>.
Under the temporary stewardship of <a href="John%20Pemberton%20%28footballer%29">John Pemberton</a>, Forest finally climbed out of the relegation zone, having beaten <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> 3–2. <a href="Billy%20Davies">Billy Davies</a>, who had taken Forest's local rivals Derby County into the Premier League two seasons earlier, was confirmed as the new manager on 1 January 2009 and watched Pemberton's side beat <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> 3–0 away in the FA Cup, prior to taking official charge. Under Davies, Forest stretched their unbeaten record in all competitions following Calderwood's sacking to six matches, including five wins. He also helped them avoid relegation as they finished 19th in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a>, securing survival with one game to go.
Forest spent most of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10 campaign</a> in a top-three position, putting together an unbeaten run of 19 league games, winning 12 home league games in a row (a club record for successive home wins in a single season), going unbeaten away from home from the beginning of the season until 30 January 2010 (a run spanning 13 games) whilst also claiming memorable home victories over local rivals Derby County and <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>. The club finished third, missing out on automatic promotion, and in the two-legged play-off semi-final were beaten by <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a>, 2–1 away and 4–3 in the home leg, the club's first defeat at home since losing to the same opposition in September 2009.
The 2010–11 season saw Forest finish in sixth place in the Championship table with 75 points, putting them into a play-off campaign for the fourth time in the space of eight years. Promotion was yet again to elude Forest, as they were beaten over two legs by eventual play-off final winners <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a>. Having drawn the first leg 0–0 at the City Ground, they were eventually beaten 3–1 in the second leg.
In June 2011, <a href="Billy%20Davies">Billy Davies</a> had his contract terminated, and was replaced as manager by <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a>, who signed a three-year contract. Forest started the 2011–12 season with several poor results and after a 5–1 defeat away to <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>, <a href="David%20Pleat">David Pleat</a> and <a href="Bill%20Beswick">Bill Beswick</a> left the club's coaching setup. Less than a week later, following a home defeat to <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>, McClaren resigned, and chairman <a href="Nigel%20Doughty">Nigel Doughty</a> announced that he intended to resign at the end of the season. In October 2011, Nottingham Forest underwent several changes. These changes included the appointment of <a href="Frank%20Clark%20%28footballer%29">Frank Clark</a> as new chairman of the club and also that of <a href="Steve%20Cotterill">Steve Cotterill</a>, replacing the recently departed <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a>.
 <a href="Nigel%20Doughty">Nigel Doughty</a>, owner and previous chairman of the club, died on 4 February 2012, having been involved with the club since the late 1990s, with many estimating his total contribution as being in the region of £100 million.
Al-Hasawi era (2012–2017).
The Al-Hasawi family from Kuwait purchased the club in July 2012. They told the press that they had a long-term vision for the club based on a 3–5 year plan, and after interviewing several potential new managers, appointed <a href="Sean%20O%27Driscoll">Sean O'Driscoll</a>, formerly the manager at Doncaster Rovers and Crawley Town, as the manager on 19 July 2012. He was known for playing an attractive brand of passing football (which had taken Doncaster Rovers into the league's second tier for the first time since the 1950s) and what football fans would consider the Forest way. O'Driscoll had spent five months at the City Ground as coach under Steve Cotterill in the 2011–12 season.
By 15 December 2012, after the team's 0–0 draw away to Brighton, Forest sat in ninth position with 33 points, just three points off the play-off positions. On the same weekend, the club announced that Omar Al-Hasawi had stepped down due to personal reasons and Fawaz Al-Hasawi, the majority shareholder with 75%, had taken the position, with his brother Abdulaziz Al-Hasawi holding a 20% share and his cousin Omar Al-Hasawi holding a 5% share.
On 26 December 2012, O'Driscoll was sacked following a 4–2 victory over Leeds United, with the club stating their intentions of a change ahead of the January transfer window and hopes of appointing a manager with Premier League experience, eventually hiring <a href="Alex%20McLeish">Alex McLeish</a>. Chief executive Mark Arthur as well as scout Keith Burt and club ambassador Frank Clark were dismissed in January 2013. On 5 February 2013, Forest and McLeish parted company by mutual agreement after 40 days of cooperation. Forest supporters and pundits alike registered their concern for the state of the club, with journalist <a href="Pat%20Murphy%20%28sports%20journalist%29">Pat Murphy</a> describing the situation as a "shambles".
Two days after McLeish's departure, the club re-appointed Billy Davies as manager, having been sacked as the team's manager twenty months previously. His first match in charge was a draw, followed by a run of 10 undefeated games. In March 2014, the club terminated Davies's employment, following a 5–0 defeat by Derby County. After initially rejecting the job in March 2014, fans favourite <a href="Stuart%20Pearce">Stuart Pearce</a> was named the man to replace Billy Davies, taking over from caretaker manager <a href="Gary%20Brazil">Gary Brazil</a>. He signed a two-year contract commencing on 1 July 2014. Pearce led Forest to an unbeaten start to the season but failed to keep up the form. He was sacked in February 2015 and replaced by another former Forest player, <a href="Dougie%20Freedman">Dougie Freedman</a>.
Another mid-table finish meant that Forest began the 2015–16 season still in the Championship and now in their 17th season away from the Premier League. On 13 March 2016, Freedman was sacked, following a 3–0 defeat at home to <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201971%29">Paul Williams</a> was then appointed as temporary manager. Former <a href="US%20Boulogne">Boulogne</a>, <a href="Valenciennes%20FC">Valenciennes</a>, <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, and <a href="Stade%20Rennais">Rennes</a> head coach <a href="Philippe%20Montanier">Philippe Montanier</a> was appointed on a two-year contract on 27 June 2016 becoming the club's first manager from outside the British isles, but was sacked after fewer than seven months in charge. <a href="Mark%20Warburton">Mark Warburton</a> was named as the club's new manager on 14 March 2017. Forest narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of the 2016–17 season, where a 3–0 home victory against <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> ensured their safety at the expense of <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>.
Evangelos Marinakis and Premier League return (2017–present).
On 18 May 2017, <a href="Evangelos%20Marinakis">Evangelos Marinakis</a> completed his takeover of Nottingham Forest, bringing an end to Al-Hasawi's reign as Forest owner. Incumbent manager Mark Warburton was sacked on 31 December 2017 following a 1–0 home defeat to struggling <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, with a record of one win in seven. He was replaced by Spaniard <a href="Aitor%20Karanka">Aitor Karanka</a>, who arrived on 8 January 2018, immediately after caretaker manager <a href="Gary%20Brazil">Gary Brazil</a> had masterminded a 4–2 home win over holders <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the third round of the FA Cup. Karanka made 10 new signings during the January transfer window, and following a 17th-place finish, he made 14 new signings during the summer transfer window and the following season results improved. Despite a strong league position, Karanka left his position on 11 January 2019 after requesting to be released from his contract. He was replaced with former Republic of Ireland boss <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a> four days later. O'Neill was sacked in June after reportedly falling out with some of the senior first team players, and was replaced with <a href="Sabri%20Lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a> on the same day. In Lamouchi's first season in charge, despite spending most of the season in the playoffs, Forest dropped to seventh place on the final day. On 6 October 2020, Lamouchi was sacked by the club following a poor start to the 2020–21 season. He was replaced by former Brighton manager <a href="Chris%20Hughton">Chris Hughton</a>. After an ultimately unsuccessful 11 months in charge, Hughton was sacked on 16 September 2021 after failing to win any of the club's opening seven games of the 2021–22 season.
Forest chairman Nicholas Randall had initially promised that Forest planned to return to playing European football within five seasons, and yet poor transfers and a toxic club culture meant that Forest remained in the Championship four years into the Marinakis era. In the summer of 2021, structural changes were made at the club to try and correct the previous mistakes. Forest appointed Dane Murphy as Chief Executive, and George Syrianos was brought in as head of recruitment to bring about a more analytics driven transfer policy. The Forest hierarchy committed to avoiding the "short-termism" of previous windows by no longer signing players for more than £18,000 a week and mostly targeting younger signings that could be sold for a profit.
On 21 September 2021, Forest announced the appointment of <a href="Steve%20Cooper%20%28football%20manager%29">Steve Cooper</a> as the club's new head coach. Cooper inspired a turnaround in form, arriving with the club in last place yet having them in 7th at Christmas, and all the way up in 4th by the end of the season, qualifying Forest for the playoffs for the first time since the 2010–11 season. In the <a href="2022%20English%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23Championship">2022 Championship play-off semi-final</a>, Forest defeated <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> on penalties to advance to the <a href="2022%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">final</a> against <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, who they beat 1–0 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, and were promoted to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> for the first time since the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>. Having entered the Premier League with a depleted squad after the promotion, in the leadup to the next season Forest signed 21 players for the first team squad. This was a British transfer record. The club record fee was also broken multiple times, and the last such occasion in the transfer window was when <a href="Morgan%20Gibbs-White">Morgan Gibbs-White</a> joined the club for £25 million with a potential to rise to £42 million subject to performance.
On 7 October 2022, after five straight defeats, the club announced Cooper had signed a new three-year contract. Results improved temporarily, but in early April, after another poor run beset with injuries, Marinakis was forced to again say he had confidence in the manager. “We have all been disappointed with recent performances, and it is very clear that a lot of hard work needs to be done to address this urgently. Results and performances must improve immediately," he said in a statement.
On 11 April 2023, with the club in the relegation zone, sporting director Filippo Giraldi was sacked after six months in the job.
On 20 May 2023, Nottingham Forest sealed their Premier League status for the following season with a 1–0 home victory over <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, which also confirmed the title for <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Forest collected 11 points from their last six games.
On 19 December 2023, it was reported that the club had sacked Cooper amid reports of his replacement by previous <a href="Al-Ittihad%20Club%20%28Jeddah%29">Al-Ittihad</a> manager <a href="Nuno%20Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Nuno Espírito Santo</a>. On 15 January 2024, Nottingham Forest was charged with breaching Premier League profit and sustainability rules in their accounts for 2022–23.
Club identity.
Crest and colours.
Nottingham Forest have worn red since the club's foundation in 1865. At the meeting in the Clinton Arms which established Nottingham Forest as a football club, the committee also passed a resolution that the team colours should be 'Garibaldi red'. This decision was made in honour of <a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a>, the Italian patriot who was the leader of the <a href="Redshirts%20%28Italy%29">redshirts</a> volunteers. At this time, clubs identified themselves more by their headgear than their shirts and a dozen red caps with tassels were duly purchased, making Forest the first club to 'officially' wear red, a colour that has since been adopted by a significant number of others. Forest's kit is the reason behind <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>'s choice of red, the club having donated a full set of red kits to Arsenal following their foundation (as Woolwich Arsenal) in 1886. <a href="British%20football%20clubs%20tours%20to%20South%20America">Forest's tour of South America</a> in 1905 inspired <a href="Argentina">Argentine</a> club <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Independiente">Independiente</a> to adopt red as their club colour, after club's President Arístides Langone described the tourists as looking like "diablos rojos" ("red devils"), which would become Independiente's nickname.
The first club crest used by Forest was the city arms of Nottingham, which was first used on kits in 1947. The current club badge was introduced in 1974. The logo has been reported as being the brainchild of manager <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a>. However, he did not arrive at the club until the following year. Forest have two <a href="star%20%28football%20badge%29">star</a>s above the club badge to commemorate its European Cup victories in 1979 and 1980.
In March 1973, a competition was announced to design a new badge for Forest. The winning design was by <a href="Nottingham%20Trent%20University%2C%20School%20of%20Art%20and%20Design">Trent Polytechnic</a> graphic design lecturer David Lewis. Lewis entered his design using his mother's maiden name in order to maintain anonymity, as one of the five judges was W. Payne, Associate Head of the Graphics Department at the polytechnic where Lewis taught. David Lewis also designed the <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Council">Nottinghamshire County Council</a> logo.
Nomenclature.
The club has garnered many nicknames over time. Historically, the nickname of "the Reds" was used, as was "Garibaldis". "The Forest" or the simpler "Forest" – as used on the club crest – is commonly used. Another, lesser-used, nickname referring to the club is the "Tricky Trees".
Stadium.
City Ground.
Since 1898, Nottingham Forest have played their home games at the <a href="City%20Ground">City Ground</a> in <a href="West%20Bridgford">West Bridgford</a>, on the banks of the <a href="River%20Trent">River Trent</a>. Prior to moving to the City Ground, Forest played their home games at <a href="Forest%20Recreation%20Ground">Forest Recreation Ground</a>, then <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>, and finally the purpose-built <a href="Town%20Ground%20%28Nottingham%29">Town Ground</a>. Since 1994, the City Ground has been all-seater, a preparation that was made in time for the ground to be a venue for <a href="Euro%2096">Euro 96</a>, and currently has a capacity of 30,404.
The City Ground is 300 yards away from <a href="Notts%20County%20Football%20Club">Notts County's</a> <a href="Meadow%20Lane">Meadow Lane</a> stadium on the opposite side of the Trent, meaning the two grounds are the closest professional football stadia geographically in England. In 1898 the City Ground was within the boundaries of <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>, which had been given <a href="city%20status%20in%20the%20UK">city status</a> the year before and gave rise to the name of the stadium. However, a boundary change in the 1950s means that the City Ground now stands just outside of the city's boundaries in the town of West Bridgford.
On 28 February 2019, Nottingham Forest announced plans to redevelop the City Ground and surrounding area, including the "creation of a new, world-class Peter Taylor Stand". It is expected this will increase the capacity of the stadium to 38,000, making it the largest football stadium in the <a href="East%20Midlands">East Midlands</a>. The club was hopeful that building work could begin at the end of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.%20season">2019-20 season</a>, but the development was put on hold due to "delays in the planning process". In September 2022, <a href="Rushcliffe%20Borough%20Council">Rushcliffe Borough Council</a>'s planning committee approved the club's request for planning permission.
Local rivals, derbies and supporters.
Whilst <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> is the closest professional football club geographically, Forest have remained at least one division higher since the 1994–95 season and the club's fiercest rivalry is with Derby County, located 14 miles away. The rivalry stems from the <a href="1898%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1898 FA Cup Final</a> when Forest caused a major upset, beating strong favourites Derby County 3-1. The two clubs contest the <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.%E2%80%93Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.%20rivalry">East Midlands derby</a>, a fixture which has taken on even greater significance since the inception of the <a href="Brian%20Clough%20Trophy">Brian Clough Trophy</a> in 2007. The Trophy will remain with Nottingham Forest until at least August 2024, with the teams now separated by two divisions.
<a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> were widely considered to be Forest's main East Midlands rivals prior to Brian Clough's success at both Derby and Forest. The ferocity is now most fiercely felt by fans who live around the Leicestershire-Nottinghamshire border.
Forest's other regional rival is <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, based in the neighbouring county of <a href="South%20Yorkshire">South Yorkshire</a>, a rivalry which has roots in the <a href="UK%20miners%27%20strike%20%281984%E2%80%9385%29">UK miners' strike of 1984–85</a> when the miners of South Yorkshire walked out on long strikes but some Nottinghamshire miners, who insisted on holding a ballot, continued to work. The 2003 <a href="Football%20League%20Championship%20Play-off">Football League Championship Play-off</a> semi-final between the two clubs, in which Sheffield United finished as 5–4 aggregate winners, also fuelled the rivalry. They met again in the 2022 play-offs, with Forest coming out on top this time, and in 2023-24 faced each other in the Premier League for the first time since 1993, with Forest winning 2-1.

Manchester City F.C.

Manchester City Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, England, that competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">top flight</a> of <a href="Football%20in%20England">English football</a>. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the <a href="City%20of%20Manchester%20Stadium">City of Manchester Stadium</a> in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a> since 1923. Manchester City adopted their <a href="sky%20blue">sky blue</a> home shirts in 1894, the first season with the current name. Over the course of its history, the club has won nine <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">league titles</a>, seven <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, eight <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cups</a>, six <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>s, one <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, one <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, one <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>, and one <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>.
The club joined the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in <a href="1892%E2%80%9393%20Football%20League">1892</a>, and won their first major honour, the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, in <a href="1904%20FA%20Cup%20final">1904</a>. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">league</a> title, <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>, and <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners Cup</a> under the management of <a href="Joe%20Mercer">Joe Mercer</a> and <a href="Malcolm%20Allison">Malcolm Allison</a>. After losing the <a href="1981%20FA%20Cup%20final">1981 FA Cup final</a>, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a> to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1998</a>. They since regained promotion to the top tier in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">2001–02</a> and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League">2002–03</a>.
Manchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by <a href="Mansour%20bin%20Zayed%20Al%20Nahyan">Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan</a> through the <a href="Abu%20Dhabi%20United%20Group">Abu Dhabi United Group</a> in August 2008. This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in <a href="2011%20FA%20Cup%20final">2011</a> and the Premier League in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Premier%20League">2012</a>, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">2014</a>. Under the management of <a href="Pep%20Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a>, Manchester City won the Premier League in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Premier%20League">2018</a>, becoming the only team in the competition history to <a href="Premier%20League%20records%20and%20statistics%23Points">attain 100 points</a> in a single season. In <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2018–19</a>, they <a href="List%20of%20association%20football%20teams%20to%20have%20won%20four%20or%20more%20trophies%20in%20one%20season%23Four%20titles%20in%20one%20season">won four trophies</a>, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29%23Domestic%20trebles">domestic treble</a>. This was followed by three consecutive Premier League titles in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Premier%20League">2020–21</a>, <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Premier%20League">2021–22</a>, and <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Premier%20League">2022–23</a>, as well as the club's first-ever <a href="2021%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">Champions League final</a> in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2021</a>, which they lost to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. The <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a> saw Manchester City win their maiden <a href="2023%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">European Cup</a> and complete the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29%23Continental%20trebles">continental treble</a> in the process, becoming the second English club to do so. The club is ranked first in the <a href="UEFA%20coefficient%23Men%27s%20club%20coefficient">UEFA coefficient standings</a> as of 2023.
Manchester City topped the <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">Deloitte Football Money League</a> at the end of the 2021–22 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at <a href="Euro">€</a>731 million. In 2022, "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" estimated the club was the <a href="Forbes%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs">sixth-most valuable</a> in the world, worth <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>4.250 billion. Manchester City are owned by <a href="City%20Football%20Group">City Football Group Limited</a>, a British-based <a href="holding%20company">holding company</a> valued at £3.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the <a href="Abu%20Dhabi%20United%20Group">Abu Dhabi United Group</a>.
History.
Early years and first trophies.
City gained their first honours by winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">1899</a>; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>. They went on to claim their first major honour on <a href="1904%20FA%20Cup%20final">23 April 1904</a>, beating <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> 1–0 at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre">Crystal Palace</a> to win the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>; the Blues narrowly missed out on a <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">League and Cup double</a> that season after finishing runners-up in the <a href="1903%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">league campaign</a>, but they still became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour. In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain <a href="Billy%20Meredith">Billy Meredith</a>, who subsequently moved across town to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. A fire at <a href="Hyde%20Road%20%28stadium%29">Hyde Road</a> destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a> in <a href="Moss%20Side">Moss Side</a>.
In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> in <a href="1933%20FA%20Cup%20final">1933</a>, before claiming the Cup by beating <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> in <a href="1934%20FA%20Cup%20final">1934</a>. During the 1934 run, the club broke the record for the <a href="List%20of%20record%20home%20attendances%20of%20English%20football%20clubs">highest home attendance</a> of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth-round FA Cup tie against <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> – a record which stood until 2016. The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division. Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the <a href="Revie%20Plan">Revie Plan</a> reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in <a href="1955%20FA%20Cup%20final">1955</a> and <a href="1956%20FA%20Cup%20final">1956</a>; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which the Blues defeated <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> 3–1, saw City goalkeeper <a href="Bert%20Trautmann">Bert Trautmann</a> continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.
First golden era and subsequent decline.
After being relegated to the Second Division in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1963</a>, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a> in January 1965. In the summer of 1965, the management team of <a href="Joe%20Mercer">Joe Mercer</a> and <a href="Malcolm%20Allison">Malcolm Allison</a> was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">Second Division title</a> and made important signings in <a href="Mike%20Summerbee">Mike Summerbee</a> and <a href="Colin%20Bell%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201946%29">Colin Bell</a>. Two seasons later, in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">1967–68</a>, City claimed the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">league championship</a> for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United. Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in <a href="1969%20FA%20Cup%20final">1969</a> and a year later triumphed in the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, defeating <a href="G%C3%B3rnik%20Zabrze">Górnik Zabrze</a> 2–1 in the <a href="1970%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20final">1970 final</a>. This was the club's only European honour until their triumph in the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2022–23 UEFA Champions League</a>. The Blues also won the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season.
The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the <a href="1974%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">final</a> of the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Football%20League%20Cup">1974 League Cup</a>. One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1973–74 season</a> against <a href="Manchester%20derby">arch-rivals</a> Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player <a href="Denis%20Law">Denis Law</a> scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals. The final trophy of the club's most successful period of the 20th century was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the <a href="1976%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">League Cup final</a>.
A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on several unsuccessful signings, such as <a href="Steve%20Daley">Steve Daley</a>. A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under <a href="John%20Bond%20%28footballer%29">John Bond</a>, City reached the <a href="1981%20FA%20Cup%20final">1981 FA Cup final</a> but lost in a replay to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1983</a> and <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1987</a>), but returned to the top flight again in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">1989</a> and finished fifth in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1991</a> and <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1992</a> under the management of <a href="Peter%20Reid">Peter Reid</a>. However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> upon its creation in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">1992</a>, but after finishing ninth in its first season they endured three years of struggle before being relegated in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20FA%20Premier%20League">1996</a>. After two seasons in the First Division, City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third-tier league after <a href="1.%20FC%20Magdeburg">1. FC Magdeburg</a> of Germany.
Recovery and two takeovers.
After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman <a href="David%20Bernstein%20%28executive%29">David Bernstein</a> introducing greater fiscal discipline. Under manager <a href="Joe%20Royle">Joe Royle</a>, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the <a href="1999%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20final">Second Division play-off final</a> against <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a>. A <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">second successive promotion</a> saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Premier%20League">2001</a> City were relegated once more. <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a> replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">2001–02 First Division championship</a>, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process. The <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2002–03 season</a> was the last at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a <a href="Manchester%20derby">derby</a> win. Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via <a href="UEFA%20Respect%20Fair%20Play%20ranking%23Qualification%20system">UEFA fair play ranking</a>. In the close <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2003–04 season</a>, the club moved to the new <a href="City%20of%20Manchester%20Stadium">City of Manchester Stadium</a>. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager <a href="Sven-G%C3%B6ran%20Eriksson">Sven-Göran Eriksson</a> became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2007</a>. After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008; he was replaced by <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a> two days later.
By 2008, Manchester City were in a financially precarious position. <a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> had taken control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen. Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the <a href="Abu%20Dhabi%20United%20Group">Abu Dhabi United Group</a>. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazilian international</a> <a href="Robinho">Robinho</a> from <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> for £32.5 million. There was not a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Premier%20League">finishing tenth</a>, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100 million on players <a href="Gareth%20Barry">Gareth Barry</a>, <a href="Roque%20Santa%20Cruz">Roque Santa Cruz</a>, <a href="Kolo%20Tour%C3%A9">Kolo Touré</a>, <a href="Emmanuel%20Adebayor">Emmanuel Adebayor</a>, <a href="Carlos%20Tevez">Carlos Tevez</a>, and <a href="Joleon%20Lescott">Joleon Lescott</a>. In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by <a href="Roberto%20Mancini">Roberto Mancini</a>. City finished the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">season</a> in fifth position in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, narrowly missing out on a place in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> but qualifying for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>.
Second golden era and arrival of Pep Guardiola.
Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the <a href="2011%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals, the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. The Blues defeated <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2010–11 season</a>, City beat out <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.
Strong performances continued to follow in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2011–12 season</a>, including a 5–1 victory over Tottenham at <a href="White%20Hart%20Lane">White Hart Lane</a> and a record-equalling <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.%201%E2%80%936%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.">6–1 win</a> over Manchester United at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, but a poor run of form in the second half of the season left City in second place, eight points behind United with only six games left to play. At this point, United suffered their own loss of form, dropping eight points in the space of four games, while City began a run of successive wins which saw both teams level on points with two games to go. Despite the Blues only needing a home win against <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>, a team in the relegation zone, they fell 1–2 behind by the end of normal time. However, two goals in injury time – <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.%203%E2%80%932%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.%23%26quot%3BThat%20Aguero%20goal%26quot%3B">the second by Sergio Agüero in the fourth added minute</a> – settled the title in City's favour, making them the first team to win the Premier League on goal difference alone.
The <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">following season</a>, City were unable to replicate the previous year's success. After finishing second in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Premier%20League">league</a>, eleven points behind Manchester United, and losing the <a href="2013%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> 0–1 to relegated <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>, Mancini was sacked. He was replaced by Chilean manager <a href="Manuel%20Pellegrini">Manuel Pellegrini</a>. In Pellegrini's <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">first year</a> in charge, City won the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> and regained the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">Premier League title</a> on the last matchday of the season. The team's league form then slowly declined over the next couple of years, as the Blues finished second in <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Premier%20League">2014–15</a> and then dropped to fourth in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Premier%20League">2015–16</a>, although the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 season</a> would see City win <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Football%20League%20Cup">another League Cup title</a> and reach the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> semi-finals for the first time.
<a href="Pep%20Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a>, former head coach of <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, was confirmed to become Manchester City's new manager on 1 February 2016, with the announcement having been made several months before Manuel Pellegrini left his position. Guardiola's <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">first season</a> in Manchester would end trophyless, with the Blues placing third in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League">league</a> standings, but the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">following season</a> proved far more successful, as City won the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous other <a href="List%20of%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics">club</a> and <a href="Football%20records%20and%20statistics%20in%20England">English league records</a> along the way.
This would prove to be the start of a period of unprecedented success for Manchester City under Guardiola. Between the 2017–18 and <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Premier%20League">2022–23 Premier League</a> seasons, City won five out of possible six league titles, only finishing second behind <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">2019–20 season</a>. Guardiola also guided the Blues to silverware in domestic cup competitions, highlighted by four consecutive League Cup triumphs in 2018–<a href="2021%20EFL%20Cup%20final">2021</a>. During the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2018–19 season</a>, City completed an unprecedented <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29%23Domestic%20trebles">domestic treble</a> of English men's titles. Apart from winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they also won the <a href="2018%20FA%20Community%20Shield">Community Shield</a>, the first time any team has ever held all four of England's primary football trophies at the same time. On the continental stage, the club achieved breakthrough in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2020–21</a>, reaching their first-ever <a href="2021%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">Champions League final</a>. In an all-English affair, City lost 0–1 to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> at the <a href="Est%C3%A1dio%20do%20Drag%C3%A3o">Estádio do Dragão</a> in <a href="Porto">Porto</a>.
The <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a> turned out to be the greatest in the club's history, as Manchester City won their third consecutive Premier League title, the <a href="2023%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> against rivals Manchester United, and their maiden <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League title</a> at the <a href="Atat%C3%BCrk%20Olympic%20Stadium">Atatürk Olympic Stadium</a> in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> against <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a>, thereby assembling a rare feat – the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29%23Continental%20trebles">continental treble</a>. The road to the Champions League victory included wins over European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated 4–1 on aggregate, and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1–5 aggregate loss at the hands of City.
Manchester City's era of sustained competitive excellence coincided with charges of breaching <a href="UEFA%20Financial%20Fair%20Play%20Regulations">Financial Fair Play</a> (FFP) regulations. In 2020, the <a href="Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport">Court of Arbitration for Sport</a> (CAS) ruled that sanctions placed on the club by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> were not justified, overturning City's two-year European ban. In 2023, the Premier League announced its own investigation of the allegations levied against Manchester City, charging the club with 115 breaches of its FFP rules up to the 2017–18 season.
Club badge and colours.
Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away <a href="kit%20%28football%29">kit</a> colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled "Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City" published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side. The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager <a href="Malcolm%20Allison">Malcolm Allison</a>'s belief that adopting the colours of <a href="A.C.%20Milan">AC Milan</a> would inspire City to glory. Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the <a href="1969%20FA%20Cup%20final">1969 FA Cup final</a>, <a href="1970%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1970 League Cup final</a>, and <a href="1970%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20final">1970 Cup Winners' Cup final</a> in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue.
City had previously worn three other <a href="Crest%20%28sports%29">badges</a> on their shirts, prior to their current badge being implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the present badge (including a ship, based on the <a href="Symbols%20of%20Manchester%23Coat%20of%20arms">City of Manchester coat of arms</a>), inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. In 1976, a <a href="heraldic%20badge">heraldic badge</a> was granted by the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> for use by City. The badge consisted of the familiar ship above a red rose but on a circular device instead of a shield (blazoned as "A roundel per fess azure and argent in chief a three masted ship sails set pennons flying or in base a rose gules barbed and seeded proper").
On occasions when Manchester City played in a major cup final, the club wore shirts bearing the City of Manchester coat of arms, as a symbol of pride in representing the city at a major event. This practice originated from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind. The club has since abandoned the practice; for the <a href="2011%20FA%20Cup%20final">2011 FA Cup final</a>, its first in the 21st century, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.
A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">arms</a> of the city of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, and consisted of a shield in front of a <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but had since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield featured a ship on its upper half representing the <a href="Manchester%20Ship%20Canal">Manchester Ship Canal</a>, and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolised the city's three rivers – the <a href="River%20Irwell">Irwell</a>, the <a href="River%20Irk">Irk</a> and the <a href="River%20Medlock">Medlock</a>. The bottom of the badge bore the motto "Superbia in Proelio", which translates as "Pride in Battle" in <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a>. Above the eagle and shield were the three stars, added for decorative purposes.
On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge, the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to discontinue the current badge and institute a new design. After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants. A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the <a href="Intellectual%20Property%20Office%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">IPO</a> when the design was trademarked on 22 December. The new badge was officially unveiled at Manchester City's home match against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> on 26 December.

Supporters.
Since moving to the City of Manchester Stadium, the club's average attendances have been in the top six in England, usually in excess of 40,000. Even in the late 1990s, when City were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, now the <a href="EFL%20League%20One">EFL League One</a>), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average of fewer than 8,000 for the division. Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimated a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour, and City's recent achievements, that figure has since ballooned to many times that size.
Manchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed by a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA). City fans' song of choice is a rendition of "<a href="Blue%20Moon%20%281934%20song%29">Blue Moon</a>", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results "typical City". Events that fans regard as "typical City" include the club being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1938</a>), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (<a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1957–58</a>), or the more recent example where Manchester City were the only team to beat <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in the latter's record-breaking <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Premier%20League">2004–05 Premier League season</a>, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> by <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a>, a team two divisions lower.
In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing <a href="inflatable">inflatable</a> objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the phenomenon is that in a match against <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>, chants from fans calling for the introduction of <a href="Imre%20Varadi">Imre Varadi</a> as a substitute mutated into "Imre Banana". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1988–89 season</a>, as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a>), with the craze reaching its peak at City's match at <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> on 26 December 1988, a game declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party. In 2010, Manchester City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed <a href="The%20Pozna%C5%84">The Poznań</a>, from fans of Polish club <a href="Lech%20Pozna%C5%84">Lech Poznań</a> that they played in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>. In 2022, Manchester City proposed the release of the <a href="Connected%20Scarf">Connected Scarf</a>, that would contain a sensor tracking physiological and emotional data of the wearer, for supporters in 2023.
Rivalries.
Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, against whom they contest the <a href="Manchester%20derby">Manchester derby</a>. Before the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves "supporters" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at <a href="Manchester%20Metropolitan%20University">Manchester Metropolitan University</a> found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester <a href="postcode">postcode</a> areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.
Over the last few years, Manchester City has also developed a <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20rivalry">notable rivalry</a> with <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, currently considered one of the biggest in association football. Though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1976–77 season</a>, Liverpool and City's modern rivalry began in the 2010s, with the Blues beating Liverpool to the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">2013–14 title</a> by just two points on the final day of the season. In the <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">final</a> of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Football%20League%20Cup">2015–16 League Cup</a>, City defeated Liverpool on <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a> after a 1–1 draw. The two clubs met in European competition for the first time in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2017–18 Champions League</a> quarter-finals, where Liverpool won <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Liverpool%20v%20Manchester%20City">5–1 on aggregate</a>, ultimately reaching the <a href="2018%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">final</a> and then <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">winning the competition</a> a year later. In the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Premier%20League">2018–19 season</a>, City again won the title on the final day, with the Blues' 98 points and Liverpool's 97 being the third- and fourth-highest Premier League points totals ever. The <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">following season</a>, Liverpool clinched the title, recording 99 points (the second-highest Premier League total ever after Manchester City's 100 in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Premier%20League">2017–18</a>) to finish 18 points above runners-up City. The Blues then regained the title in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Premier%20League">2020–21</a> and outgunned Liverpool in another closely-fought title race in <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Premier%20League">2021–22</a>, to finish with 93 points to Liverpool's 92.
The success of the two teams in the 2010s and 2020s has led to the development of a rivalry between <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a> and <a href="Pep%20Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a>, the managers of Liverpool and Manchester City, with the two previously having been the respective managers of "<a href="Der%20Klassiker">Der Klassiker</a>" rivals <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. At the end of the 2018–19 season, Guardiola described his relationship with Klopp as a "beautiful rivalry" and called Klopp's Liverpool team "the strongest opponents I have faced in my career as a manager". In September 2019, Klopp hailed Guardiola for being his 'greatest rival ever', after both were nominated for the <a href="The%20Best%20FIFA%20Football%20Coach">FIFA Men's Coach of the Year</a> award in 2019, which Klopp ultimately won. In a 2019 survey, City fans answered that Liverpool, and not Manchester United, are the club's biggest rivals.
Manchester City also have long established local rivalries with <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>, <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a>, and <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a>, and more recent competitive Premier League rivalries with <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>.
Ownership and finances.
The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a <a href="private%20limited%20company">private limited company</a>, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister <a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra">Thaksin Shinawatra</a>. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousands of small shareholders.
Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX), where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company. By August, UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to "squeeze out" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and <a href="Panthongtae%20Shinawatra">Oak Chinnawat</a> became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> executive <a href="Garry%20Cook%20%28CEO%29">Garry Cook's</a> appointment as executive chairman in May. The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the fiscal year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which the club published accounts as a public company.
Thaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club, in total around £30 million, whereas over the several previous seasons Manchester City's net spending had been among the lowest in the Premier League. A year later, this investment was dwarfed by an influx of money derived from the club's takeover. On 1 September 2008, <a href="Abu%20Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>-based <a href="Abu%20Dhabi%20United%20Group">Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited</a> completed the takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200 million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer "deadline-day" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to <a href="gazump">gazump</a> <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>'s protracted bid to sign <a href="Dimitar%20Berbatov">Dimitar Berbatov</a> from <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> for a fee in excess of £30 million. Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed <a href="Robinho">Robinho</a> from <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> for a <a href="Progression%20of%20British%20football%20transfer%20record">British record transfer fee</a> of £32.5 million. The wealth of the new owners meant that, in the summer of 2009, City were able to finance the purchase of experienced international players prior to the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">new season</a>, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.

Stadium.
The City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, known as the Etihad Stadium since 2011 for sponsorship reasons, is on a 200-year <a href="lease">lease</a> from <a href="Manchester%20City%20Council">Manchester City Council</a> to Manchester City. It has been the club's home since the end of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2002–03 season</a>, when City moved from <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a>. Before moving to the stadium, the club spent in excess of £30 million to convert it to football use: the pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand was constructed. The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in a <a href="friendly%20match">friendly match</a>. A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 football season</a>, increasing the stadium's capacity to 55,097. A North Stand third tier is in development, potentially increasing capacity to around 61,000.
After playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at <a href="Hyde%20Road%20%28stadium%29">Hyde Road Football Stadium</a>, its home for 36 years. A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the "Wembley of the North" by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934. Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003; it was renamed the Etihad Stadium in 2011.
Honours.
Based on trophy count, Manchester City are one of <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20England%20by%20competitive%20honours%20won">the most successful teams in England</a> – their thirty-four major domestic, European and worldwide honours rank them tied for fourth with <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> on the list of most decorated sides in England, ahead of <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> with 26.
The club's first major trophy was the <a href="1904%20FA%20Cup%20final">1904 FA Cup</a>, though they had previously won three regional <a href="Manchester%20Cup">Manchester Cup</a>s before that point. Their first top division league title came in the <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">1936–37 season</a>, with the first <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">Charity Shield</a> won in the following August. City's first <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> and <a href="UEFA%20club%20competitions">European trophy</a> both came at the end of the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">1969–70 season</a>, the two trophies also constituting the team's first double of any kind. In the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2018–19 season</a>, City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single season, winning not just the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, <a href="2019%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup</a>, and <a href="2019%20EFL%20Cup%20final">League Cup</a>, but also the <a href="2019%20FA%20Community%20Shield">Community Shield</a>.
The <a href="1970%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20final">1970 Cup Winners' Cup</a> victory remained City's only European trophy until their triumph in the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2022–23 UEFA Champions League</a>. They have reached the semi-finals of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> four times overall, losing in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Semi-finals">2016</a>, then winning en route to their first-ever <a href="2021%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">final</a> in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Semi-finals">2021</a>, losing in <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Semi-finals">2022</a>, and winning en route to their maiden <a href="2023%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">European Cup title</a> in <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Semi-finals">2023</a>.
Manchester City jointly hold the record for <a href="List%20of%20teams%20promoted%20from%20the%20English%20Football%20League%20Championship%20and%20predecessors">most second division titles</a> with <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>, both clubs having won the league on seven occasions. Their first victory was in <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">1898–99</a>, and the most recent in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">2001–02</a>.

Reading F.C.

Reading Football Club ( ) is a professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading, Berkshire</a>, England. They compete in <a href="EFL%20League%20One">EFL League One</a>, the third level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. They play their home matches at the <a href="Madejski%20Stadium">Madejski Stadium</a>.
Reading are nicknamed "The Royals", due to Reading's location in the <a href="Berkshire">Royal County of Berkshire</a>, though they were previously known as "The Biscuitmen", due to the town's association with biscuit maker <a href="Huntley%20%26amp%3B%20Palmers">Huntley & Palmers</a>. Established in 1871, the club is one of the oldest teams in England, but did not join <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> until 1920, and first played in the top tier of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a> in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2006–07 season</a>. The club competed in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Premier%20League">2012–13 Premier League</a> season, having gained promotion at the end of the 2011–12 season after winning the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>, but were relegated after just one season back in the top flight.
Reading won the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Full%20Members%27%20Cup">1987–88 Full Members' Cup</a> and were one of only two Second Division clubs to lift the trophy, beating <a href="Luton%20Town">Luton Town</a> 4–1 in the final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. The club's best performance in the FA Cup was reaching the semi-finals which they achieved twice: in <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20FA%20Cup">1926–27</a> and <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20FA%20Cup">2014–15</a>.
The club played at <a href="Elm%20Park%20%28stadium%29">Elm Park</a> for 102 years, from 1896 to 1998. In 1998, the club moved to the new <a href="Madejski%20Stadium">Madejski Stadium</a>, which was named after the club's former chairman <a href="John%20Madejski">Sir John Madejski</a>. In 2021, the club announced that the ground would be known as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the subsequent decade for sponsorship reasons.
The club holds the record for the number of successive league wins at the start of a season, with a total of 13 wins at the start of the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1985–86</a> Third Division campaign and also the record for the highest number of points gained in a professional league season: 106 points in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Football%20League%20Championship">2005–06 Football League Championship</a> campaign. Reading then achieved their highest finish of eighth in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Premier%20League">2006–07 Premier League</a>, their first season as a top flight club.
History.
Formation and gradual rise (1871–1991).
Reading were formed on 25 December 1871, following a public meeting at the Bridge Street Rooms organised by Joseph Edward Sydenham, who would go on to be club secretary. The early matches were played at Reading Recreation Ground, and later the club held fixtures at Reading Cricket Ground, Coley Park and Caversham Cricket Ground. The switch to professionalism in 1895 resulted in the need for a bigger ground and, to this end, the club moved again, to the purpose-built <a href="Elm%20Park%20%28stadium%29">Elm Park</a> on 5 September 1896. In 1913, Reading had a successful tour of Italy, prompting the leading sports newspaper "<a href="Corriere%20della%20Sera">Corriere della Sera</a>" to write, "Without doubt, Reading FC are the finest foreign team seen in Italy".
Reading were elected to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Football League Third Division South</a> of the <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1920. Reading's best performance in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> came in <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20in%20English%20football">1926–27</a> when they lost to eventual winners <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> at Wolverhampton in the semi-final, a placement the club would not match again until 2015, when they lost to holders <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the semi-final. Reading lost their place in <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a> in May 1931, and remained in Third Division South until the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The club won the Southern Section Cup, beating <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> in the two-legged final in 1938, and when taking part in the regional <a href="Wartime%20League">London War League</a> and <a href="Football%20League%20War%20Cup">Cup</a> competitions, gained another honour by beating Brentford in the <a href="London%20War%20Cup">London War Cup</a> Final of 1941 by 3–2 at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>.
When League football resumed after the war, Reading quickly came to prominence once again. The club's record victory, 10–2 versus <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>, was recorded in September 1946, and Reading twice finished runners-up in the Third (South), in 1948–49 and 1951–52, but they were denied a return to Division Two as only the champions were promoted. The side's moment of cup glory came in 1988 when they won the <a href="Full%20Members%20Cup">Simod Cup</a>, beating a number of top-flight sides en route to their <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> win over <a href="Luton%20Town%20FC">Luton Town</a>. Reading were promoted to the Second Division as champions in 1986 under the management of <a href="Ian%20Branfoot">Ian Branfoot</a>, but were relegated back to the Third Division in 1988.
Onwards and upwards (1991–2005).
The appointment of <a href="Mark%20McGhee">Mark McGhee</a> as player-manager, shortly after the takeover by <a href="John%20Madejski">John Madejski</a>, in 1991 saw Reading move forward. They were crowned champions of the new Division Two in 1994. Thirty-five-year-old striker <a href="Jimmy%20Quinn%20%28Northern%20Irish%20footballer%29">Jimmy Quinn</a> was put in charge of the first team alongside midfielder <a href="Mick%20Gooding">Mick Gooding</a> and guided Reading to runners-up in the final Division One table – only to be denied automatic promotion because of the streamlining of the Premier League, from 22 teams to 20. In 1995, Reading had eased past <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere Rovers</a> in the <a href="1995%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23Semi-finals">play-off semi-finals</a> and looked to have booked their place in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> only to lose 4-3 against <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> in the <a href="1995%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20Final">final having been 2-0 up and missed a penalty at half-time</a>. Quinn and Gooding's contracts were not renewed two years later after Reading had slid into the bottom half of Division One. Their successor, <a href="Terry%20Bullivant">Terry Bullivant</a>, lasted less than a season before being sacked in March 1998. Reading were relegated back to Division Two at the end of the 1997-98 season.
The year 1998 also saw Reading move into the new 24,200 all-seater <a href="Madejski%20Stadium">Madejski Stadium</a>, named after chairman John Madejski. <a href="Tommy%20Burns%20%28footballer%29">Tommy Burns</a> had taken over from Terry Bullivant but lasted just 18 months before being replaced by <a href="Alan%20Pardew">Alan Pardew</a>, who had previously been reserve team manager before being released. The club finished third in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a> qualifying for the <a href="2001%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23Second%20Division">play-offs</a>, losing 2–3 in the <a href="2001%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20Final">final</a> against <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in Cardiff. Reading returned to Division One for <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03</a> after finishing runners-up in Division Two. The following season, they finished fourth in Division One and qualified for the <a href="2003%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23First%20Division">play-offs</a>, where they lost in the semi-final to <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>. Pardew moved to <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> the following October and was replaced by <a href="Steve%20Coppell">Steve Coppell</a>.
Rise to the Premier League and yo-yo years (2005–2013).
Reading won the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06</a> Championship with a league record 106 points, scoring 99 goals and losing only twice. They were promoted to English football's top division for the first time in their history. The <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07</a> season saw Reading make their first appearance in the top flight of English football. Reading defied pre-season predictions of relegation to finish the season in eighth place with 55 points. Reading turned down the chance to play in the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a>. In the run up to their second season in the Premier League, Reading took part in the <a href="2007%20Peace%20Cup">2007 Peace Cup</a> in South Korea. This second season was less successful, however, and Reading were relegated back to the Championship.
Reading started the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09 season</a> with a 15 match unbeaten home run. They finished fourth and qualify for the <a href="2009%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23Championship">play-offs</a>, where they lost to <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> in the semi-final. Manager Steve Coppell resigned just hours after the game, replaced by <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a>. Rodgers left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009 and <a href="Brian%20McDermott%20%28footballer%29">Brian McDermott</a> made caretaker manager the same day. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20FA%20Cup">2010–11 FA Cup</a>, Reading reached the quarter-final, where they lost 1–0 to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> at <a href="City%20of%20Manchester%20Stadium">Etihad Stadium</a>, Reading eventually finished fifth in the Championship to qualify for the division's <a href="Football%20League%20Championship%20play-offs%232011">play-off</a>s. After beating Cardiff City in the semi-finals, they lost 4–2 to <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a> in the <a href="2011%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a>. In the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20in%20English%20football">2011–12 season</a>, a streak of good form in the second half of the season, ensured promotion back to the Premier League on 17 April 2012 with 1–0 home win against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>.
On 21 January 2012 it was reported that Madejski planned to relinquish control of the club by selling a 51% stake for £40 million to Thames Sports Investments, a Russian consortium headed by <a href="Anton%20Zingarevich">Anton Zingarevich</a>. As part of the deal, Madejski would continue as chairman before becoming honorary life president. Madejski's ownership of the club ended on 29 May 2012.
McDermott led Reading to their first Premier League win of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Premier%20League">2012–13 season</a> on 17 November 2012 at their 11th attempt, defeating <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> 2–1 at home. On 11 March 2013, however, he left his position at Reading. <a href="Nigel%20Adkins">Nigel Adkins</a> was then appointed as manager, though he was unable to save them from relegation after drawing <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> 0–0 on 28 April 2013 at <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a>.
Return to the Championship (2013–2023).
The following season back in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a> saw Reading make two high-profile signings in <a href="Wayne%20Bridge">Wayne Bridge</a> and <a href="Royston%20Drenthe">Royston Drenthe</a> in hope of an immediate return to the Premier League. Reading, however, missed out on the playoffs because of a last minute winner from <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion's</a> <a href="Leonardo%20Ulloa">Leonardo Ulloa</a>, which meant the Seagulls made the playoffs at Reading's expense.
The 2014–15 pre-season saw further arrivals of <a href="Jamie%20Mackie">Jamie Mackie</a> on loan, <a href="Oliver%20Norwood">Oliver Norwood</a> and the return of <a href="Simon%20Cox%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201987%29">Simon Cox</a>. The club was under a high threat of <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>, causing departures of <a href="Sean%20Morrison%20%28footballer%29">Sean Morrison</a> and <a href="Adam%20Le%20Fondre">Adam Le Fondre</a> and a Thai <a href="consortium">consortium</a> taking over the club. A good start to Nigel Adkins' second season in charge was followed by a poor run of results that ended with his sacking after a 6–1 away defeat to <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> with <a href="Steve%20Clarke">Steve Clarke</a> taking over the next day in the hope of a promotion push. However, a lack of goals and some poor form in the league meant the club faced some fears of relegation to League One, but safety was secured with few games to spare. Nonetheless, during that time, the club embarked on a successful FA Cup journey, reaching the semi-final where they lost 2–1 to Arsenal at Wembley. The <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">following season</a> saw the club bring in many players in the hopes of gaining promotion, but the club finished 17th.
In the summer leading up to the <a href="2016-17%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2016–17 season</a> the club announced the departure of Brian McDermott and eventually he was to be replaced by former <a href="Manchester%20United%20Football%20Club">Manchester United</a> defender <a href="Jaap%20Stam">Jaap Stam</a>. Under Stam, Reading achieved their highest finish since relegation back to the Championship by finishing third and reaching the play-offs, where they beat Fulham on aggregate before facing <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> in the final at Wembley where they lost on penalties following 0–0 draw after extra time. In 2017, Chinese investors <a href="Dai%20Yongge">Dai Yongge</a> and Dai Xiu Li acquired the club.
The team languished towards the bottom of the table for most of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a>. On 21 March 2018, Stam resigned as manager after a nine-game winless run. Two days later, on 23 March 2018, <a href="Paul%20Clement%20%28football%20manager%29">Paul Clement</a> was appointed as Reading's new manager; the club finished the season in 20th place, avoiding relegation by three points.
Clement was sacked on 6 December 2018 after poor results left the club outside of the relegation zone only on goal difference. He was replaced by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Gomes">José Gomes</a> on 22 December, who steered the club away from relegation to finish 20th again. However, after a slow start to the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2019–20 season</a>, Gomes was dismissed after less than a year in charge with the team in the relegation zone in October 2019. Sporting director <a href="Mark%20Bowen%20%28footballer%29">Mark Bowen</a> was promoted to the role as his replacement a week later and led the team to finish 14th before departing the club in August 2020.
Former Chicago Fire boss <a href="Veljko%20Paunovi%C4%87">Veljko Paunović</a> was appointed manager on 29 August 2020. The team got off to an excellent start to the <a href="2020-21%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2020–21 season</a>, winning seven of their first eight league games. However, the team's form faded after injuries to several key players and they eventually narrowly missed out of the play-offs, finishing seventh.
On 17 November 2021 it was confirmed Reading would be deducted six points due to breaching the EFL's profitability and sustainability rules. Over five years, the club reported pre-tax losses of £146m, way beyond the EFL's limit of a £13m annual pre-tax loss. In 2021, the club spent 234% of its revenue on player wages.
Following a 3–2 away victory over <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> in February 2022, manager Veljko Paunović left by mutual consent, with <a href="Paul%20Ince">Paul Ince</a> being placed in interim charge of the team alongside academy manager <a href="Michael%20Gilkes%20%28footballer%29">Michael Gilkes</a>. On 16 May, Ince became the team's permanent manager, with <a href="Mark%20Bowen%20%28footballer%29">Mark Bowen</a> returning as head of football operations.
On 1 March 2023, the team was reported to be facing another six-point deduction for breaching profitability and sustainability rules. The club accepted the penalty on 4 April 2023, enforced with immediate effect. A week later, on 11 April, Ince left after a run of eight games without a win, leaving the club in 22nd place, one point from safety. Under-21 manager <a href="Noel%20Hunt">Noel Hunt</a> was placed in interim charge until the end of the season. The club was relegated from the Championship on 4 May 2023 after 10 years in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">second tier</a>. Without the six point deduction, Reading would have finished on 50 points, escaping relegation.
League One struggles and club for sale (2023–).
In June 2023, Reading were charged by the EFL with failing to pay their players on time and in full, in October and November 2022, and April 2023, and with non-payment of taxes - charges that meant Reading might start their <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2023–24</a> League One season with a points deduction. Following the EFL's action, Reading fans groups united to launch a campaign, Sell Before We Dai, urging owner Dai Yongge to sell the club, calling his stewardship "an unmitigated disaster" and citing the club's "excruciating financial losses". On 27 June, Reading were served a winding-up petition by <a href="HM%20Revenue%20and%20Customs">HMRC</a> over the unpaid tax bills, with a hearing set for 9 August (on 12 July, football finance expert <a href="Kieran%20Maguire">Kieran Maguire</a> described the club's ownership as "a car crash"). On 28 July, the club was placed under another transfer embargo because of the unpaid taxes. On 2 August, Dai Yongge was reported to be seeking new investors to bring financial stability to the club.
Meanwhile, on 26 June 2023, Reading announced the provisional appointment of <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Sell%C3%A9s">Rubén Sellés</a> as their new manager, confirmed on 14 July, after his visa application was successful.
On 16 August 2023, after one win and two defeats in their opening three league fixtures, Reading had a point deducted (their third deduction in three consecutive seasons), and a further three-point deduction suspended, for its failures to pay players fully and on time during the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a>. Dai Yongge was ordered to pay 125% of the club's forecast monthly wages into a designated account. Failure to comply, or not paying wages on time up to 30 June 2024, would activate the suspended penalty; the three-point deduction was applied on 13 September, and Dai Yongge faced a misconduct charge.
On 29 September 2023, Dai Yongge said he was open to "credible offers of interest" to buy the club after another transfer embargo was imposed in respect to an outstanding tax bill. A 3–2 home defeat by <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> on 28 October dropped the club to the bottom of League One on six points, eight from safety; the match was preceded by a fans protest against Dai Yongge's ownership. On 31 October, the club was served another HMRC winding-up petition over unpaid taxes. On 1 November, Reading were referred to an EFL independent disciplinary commission regarding unpaid HMRC debts owed in September and October 2023; an EFL hearing against Dai Yongge is scheduled for the end of November. On 9 November, a sale of the club was reported to be progressing, and the latest winding-up petition and transfer embargo had been resolved. On 19 December 2023, Dai Yongge was fined £20,000 for Reading's wages failures; the EFL had recommended a 12-month ban from all football activities, but an independent disciplinary commission opted not to enforce it. A further £50,000 fine was suspended until 12 January 2024, and was triggered after Dai Yongge again failed to make the required full wage deposits.
On 13 January 2024, Reading's match against <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a> was abandoned after home fans invaded the pitch to protest about Yongge's ownership of the club. After imposing a £50,000 fine for failing to meet wages deadlines, the EFL said Dai Yongge must "fund the club adequately" or "make immediate arrangements to sell". Reading CEO Dayong Pang said that, after two unsuccessful offers, Dai Yongge was "100% willing to sell the club" and the selling process was "ongoing"; On 26 January 2024, former CEO <a href="Nigel%20Howe">Nigel Howe</a> (asked by Dai Yongge to oversee the club's sale) said eight parties were interested in buying Reading but any sale would take at least two months to complete.
Crest and colours.
The first crest to appear on a Reading <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a> was in 1953, it featured just the letter "R". There was no crest seen again until 1981 when there was a crest featuring three elm trees and the rivers <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a> and <a href="River%20Kennet">Kennet</a>; this only lasted two seasons. From 1987 to 1996 the crest used the new kit colours of yellow, sky blue, royal blue and white. A brief return to a design based on the 1981 crest was reintroduced for the 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons. Commenting on the need for a new crest to coincide with the move to the Madejski Stadium, as well as moving into the new millennium, Sir John Madejski said: "I know some traditionalists will say we should keep the old badge but they should bear in mind the need to move forward." The current crest was first seen on the kits for the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>. It is based on the club colours—blue and white—and includes a crown to represent the Royal County of Berkshire and the <a href="Maiwand%20Lion">Maiwand Lion</a> to represent Reading.
The club's home kit for the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a> saw <a href="University%20of%20Reading">University of Reading</a>'s <a href="Ed%20Hawkins%20%28climatologist%29">Ed Hawkins'</a> stripe design included on the sleeves with the stripes representing the average temperature for a single year since Reading's foundation to raise awareness for climate change, the shirt itself being made of recycled plastic bottles.
Stadium.
The club played at Reading Recreation Ground until 1878, before moving on to Reading Cricket Ground (1878–1882), <a href="Coley%20Park">Coley Park</a> (1882–1889) and <a href="Caversham%2C%20Berkshire">Caversham</a> Cricket Ground (1889–1896).
In 1889, Reading were unable to continue playing at Coley Park as W B Monck (the local <a href="squire">squire</a>) no longer allowed football due to "rowdyism [by] the rougher elements". With club membership exceeding 300 by the time the club went professional in 1895, Reading required a proper ground. A meeting the following year determined that funding would be difficult. £20 was donated by J C Fidler, on the proviso that "no liquors were to be sold" on site. The rest of the cost was financed through donations by wealthy supporters, as well as one large individual donation. A former <a href="gravel%20pit">gravel pit</a> in <a href="West%20Reading%2C%20Berkshire">West Reading</a> was identified as the site. The first game at Elm Park was held on 5 September 1896 between Reading and <a href="Arthur%20Roston%20Bourke">A Roston Bourke</a>'s XI. The visitors were a <a href="scratch%20team">scratch team</a> from Holloway College. £44 was taken on the gate, with an attendance of approximately 2,500.
In 1908, the club's <a href="annual%20general%20meeting">annual general meeting</a> proposed moving to a new ground near <a href="Reading%20railway%20station">Reading railway station</a>. A board meeting the following year decided that the move would not be possible, as "there was no chance of a move to the ground near to the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">GWR</a> railway stations due to the actions of the Great Western Railway".
In 1994, the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> made an <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a> compulsory in the top two divisions (the Premier League and the first division). Reading were champions of the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">second division</a> in 1994, and were promoted to the first division. Reading became subject to the Taylor requirements, though converting Elm Park to an all-seater stadium would have been impractical. Instead, a location in Smallmead (to the south of the town) was identified as the site for a new stadium. The former council landfill site was bought for £1, with further conditions that the development of the stadium would include part-funding of the <a href="A33%20road">A33 relief road</a>. Expansion of the club's home would also allow alternative commercial ventures (particularly leisure facilities) and shared use with other teams (such as <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> clubs <a href="Richmond%20F.C.">Richmond</a> and <a href="London%20Irish">London Irish</a>). The last competitive match at Elm Park took place on 3 May 1998 against <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>, with Reading losing 1–0. Reading began the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a> at the <a href="Madejski%20Stadium">Madejski Stadium</a>. It was opened on 22 August 1998 when <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> were beaten 3–0. The stadium cost more than £50 million to build. For the first time in its history, Reading Football Club participated in the Premier League in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07</a> season. As a result of the sell-out crowds for their first few fixtures of the season, the club announced their intention, in October 2006, to make a planning application to extend the ground to between 37,000 and 38,000 seats. The application was made on 24 January 2007, proposing initially the extension of the East Stand with a further 6,000 seats (raising capacity to around 30,000) and subsequently extension of the North and South Stands to reach the full proposed capacity. On 24 May 2007, it was announced that planning permission had been granted to extend the stadium to a capacity of 36,900. 
On 5 July 2016, at the end of <a href="Eamonn%20Dolan">Eamonn Dolan</a>'s funeral, Reading announced that the North Stand would be renamed the Eamonn Dolan Stand.
During the 2019-20 season Reading moved to a new training ground at Bearwood Golf Club to replace Hogwood Park, their previous training facility. 
In July 2021, at the beginning of the club's 150th anniversary season, it was announced that the Madejski Stadium had been rebranded as the Select Car Leasing Stadium for the next ten years. In honour of Sir John Madejski, the East Stand was renamed as "The Sir John Madejski Stand".
Since 2023, Graham Griffin has been acting as the Stadium Manager.
Support.
In 1930, the Reading Football Supporters’ Club (RFSC) was formed to represent the interests of supporters of the club and to assist in raising funds for the football club. On 18 March 2002, the Supporters' Trust at Reading become the official successor to the RFSC.
In 2001, Reading became the first football club to register their fans as an official member of their squad, giving the "player" registered with squad number 13 as 'Reading Fans'.
For the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 season</a>, Reading had 12,983 season ticket holders – ranked 10th in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> and almost identical to former <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">league champions</a> <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>. The figure for that season was greater than the 12,552 recorded in the previous season, but down from the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Reading%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a> Championship peak of 14,547. The average attendance for the 2015–16 season was 17,570 – the 10th highest in the Championship.
Rivalries.
Before going out of business in 1992, <a href="Aldershot%20F.C.">Aldershot</a> were Reading's biggest rivals. Aldershot were, geographically, the closest <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> club to Reading. There was a strong rift between the two sets of fans, with fighting between fans occurring on several occasions. Strong feelings remain between fans of Reading and fans of <a href="Aldershot%20Town%20F.C.">Aldershot Town</a>, the refounded club in <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a>. Aldershot Town were promoted into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 2008, but the clubs haven't met in a competitive match since the demise of the original club. Aldershot were relegated out of the league in 2013, having entered administration, reducing the chances of a competitive meeting between the two sides in the near future.
Since Aldershot's exile, Reading's main local rivalries have been with <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a> and <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a>. When the three teams had shared a division, their rivalry was referred to as the "Didcot Triangle". However, the rivalry between Oxford and Swindon is stronger than between either of the two and Reading, largely due to them both spending their recent history in lower divisions than Reading, and spending their previous history in higher divisions than Reading. In 2012, a small survey showed that Reading's main rivals were Aldershot Town, followed by Swindon Town and <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a>.

Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, <a href="South%20Yorkshire">South Yorkshire</a>, England. They compete in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>, the second level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. 
Formed in 1867 as an offshoot of <a href="The%20Wednesday%20Cricket%20Club">The Wednesday Cricket Club</a> (itself formed in 1820), they were known as The Wednesday Football Club until 1929. Wednesday is one of the <a href="oldest%20football%20clubs">oldest surviving football clubs</a> in the world of any code, and the second-oldest professional association football club in England. In 1868 its team won the <a href="Cromwell%20Cup">Cromwell Cup</a>, only the second tournament of its kind. They were founding members and inaugural champions of the <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a> in 1889, before joining <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> three years later. In 1992, they became founder members of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. The team has spent most of its league history in English football's top flight, but they have not played at that level since being relegated in 2000.
The Owls, as they are nicknamed, are one of the most successful teams in English football, having won four <a href="English%20football%20champions">league titles</a>, three <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, one <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> and one <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>. Wednesday have also competed in <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> cup competitions on four occasions, reaching the quarter-finals of the <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> in 1963. In 1991, they defeated Manchester United 1–0 in the <a href="1991%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">Football League Cup final</a> as a second-tier team. As of 2022 they remain the last team to win one of English football's major trophies while outside the top flight.
In the 19th century, they played their matches at several stadiums around central Sheffield, including <a href="Olive%20Grove">Olive Grove</a> and <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a>. Since 1899, the club has played all its home matches at <a href="Hillsborough%20Stadium">Hillsborough stadium</a>, a near-40,000 capacity stadium in the north-west Sheffield suburb of <a href="Owlerton">Owlerton</a>. Wednesday's biggest rivals are <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, with whom they contest the <a href="Steel%20City%20derby">Steel City derby</a>.
History.
Early years (1867–1889).
Although no contemporary evidence has been found to support the claim, it is commonly believed that "The Wednesday Cricket Club" was formed in 1820. Nevertheless, an 1842 article in "<a href="Bell%27s%20Life%20in%20London">Bell's Life</a>" magazine states the club was founded as far back as 1816.
The club was so named because it was on Wednesdays that the founding members had a half-day off work. They were initially based at the <a href="Darnall%20New%20Ground">New Ground</a> in <a href="Darnall">Darnall</a>, and often went by the name of "Darnall Wednesday", but also played at <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20Sheffield">Hyde Park</a>. In 1855 they were one of six clubs that helped build <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a>, and held a wicket there for many years.
Famous players to have represented the cricket club include Harry Sampson, who scored 162 on ice in 1841, <a href="Tom%20Marsden">Tom Marsden</a>, who scored 227 for Sheffield & Leicester vs Nottingham in 1826, and <a href="George%20Ulyett">George Ulyett</a>, who represented the club in the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand%20in%201876%E2%80%9377">first ever international test match</a> before becoming one of only a select band of players who played for both sections of The Wednesday Club.
On the evening of Wednesday 4 September 1867, a meeting was held at the <a href="Adelphi%20Hotel%20%28Sheffield%29">Adelphi Hotel</a> to establish whether there was interest among the club's members to form a football club to keep the team together and fit during the winter months. The proposal proved very popular, with over 60 members signing up for the new team on the first night. They played their first match against The Mechanics on 19 October the same year, winning by three goals and four '<a href="Sheffield%20Rules%23The%20rouge">rouges</a>' to nil.
It soon became apparent that football would come to eclipse the cricketing side of the club in terms of popularity—the two sections went their separate ways in 1882 after a dispute over finances and the cricket club ceased to exist in 1925. On 1 February 1868, Wednesday played their first competitive football match as they entered the <a href="Cromwell%20Cup">Cromwell Cup</a>, a one-off four-team competition for newly formed clubs. A week after their semi-final, they went on to win the cup, beating the Garrick club in the final after extra time, the only goal being scored in diminishing light at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a>. This was one of the first recorded instances of a match being settled by a "<a href="golden%20goal">golden goal</a>" although the term was not in use at the time.
A key figure during the formative years of the football club was <a href="Charles%20Clegg%20%28footballer%29">Charles Clegg</a>, who joined the Wednesday in 1867. His relationship with the club lasted for the rest of his life and eventually led to his becoming the club's chairman. He also became president and chairman of the <a href="The%20Football%20Association">Football Association</a>, and was known as the "Napoleon of Football". Clegg played for <a href="England%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">England</a> in the <a href="1872%20Scotland%20v%20England%20football%20match">first-ever international match</a>, against <a href="Scotland%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> in November 1872. This completed a unique double for the club, who could lay claim to having a player in the first international games of both cricket and football.
 In 1876 Wednesday acquired Scot <a href="James%20Lang%20%28footballer%29">James Lang</a>. Although he was not employed by the club, he was given a job by a member of the Sheffield Wednesday board that had no formal duties. He is now acknowledged as the first professional football player in England. With Lang in their team the football club became one of the strongest in the region, a reputation that was cemented when they won the inaugural <a href="Sheffield%20%26amp%3B%20Hallamshire%20Senior%20Cup">Sheffield FA Challenge Cup</a> in 1877.
In 1880 the club entered the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time, and they soon became one of the most respected sides in the country. But although they had had Lang on their books a decade earlier, the club officially remained staunchly amateur, and this stance almost cost the club its very existence. By the middle of the decade, Wednesday's best players were leaving in their droves to join clubs who would pay them, and in January 1887 they lost 0–16 against Halliwell with just 10 players in their team. An emergency meeting was held, and the board members finally agreed to pay its players.
Professional football, English Champions and FA Cup winners (1889–1939).
The move to professionalism took the club from Bramall Lane, which had taken a share of the ticket revenue, to the new <a href="Olive%20Grove">Olive Grove</a>. In 1889 the club became founder members of the <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a>, of which they were the first champions in a season where they also reached the <a href="1890%20FA%20Cup%20final">1890 FA Cup final</a>, losing 6–1 to <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> at <a href="Kennington%20Oval">Kennington Oval</a>, London. Despite finishing the following season bottom of the Alliance, they were eventually elected to the expanded <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1892. They won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time in <a href="1896%20FA%20Cup%20final">1896</a>, beating <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> 2–1 at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre">Crystal Palace</a>.
Owing to an expansion of the local railway lines, the club was told that they would have to find a new ground for the <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20in%20English%20football">1899–1900 season</a>. After a difficult search the club finally bought some land in the village of <a href="Owlerton">Owlerton</a>, which at the time was several miles outside the Sheffield city boundaries. Construction of a new stadium (now known as <a href="Hillsborough%20Stadium">Hillsborough Stadium</a>) was completed within months and the club was secured for the next century. In a strong decade, Wednesday won the League in the <a href="1902%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">1902–03</a> and <a href="1903%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">1903–04</a> seasons and the FA Cup again in <a href="1907%20FA%20Cup%20final">1907</a>, beating <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> 2–1, again at Crystal Palace. When competitive football was suspended in 1915 because of the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the club participated in several regionalised war leagues, until 1919, when competitive football resumed.
They were relegated from the top flight for the first time in 1920, and did not return until 1926, and in the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20in%20English%20football">1927–28</a> season they looked like going down again before securing a haul of 17 points from their last 10 matches to secure safety. Wednesday went on to win the League title the following season (<a href="1928%E2%80%9329%20in%20English%20football">1928–29</a>), which started a run that saw the team finishing lower than third only once until 1936. The period was topped off with the team winning the FA Cup for the third time in the club's history in <a href="1935%20FA%20Cup%20final">1935</a>. When <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> began, the club entered non-competitive war leagues, returning to competitive football in 1946.
The yo-yo years (1945–1959).
The 1950s saw Wednesday unable to consistently hold on to a position in the top flight and this period became known as the <a href="Yo-yo%20club">yo-yo years</a>. After being promoted in 1950 they were relegated three times, although each time they returned to the top flight by winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> the following season. The decade ended on a high note with the team finishing in the top half of the First Division for the first time since World War II.
Back in the top flight and title contenders (1959–1970).
In 1961, the club ran toe-to-toe with <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> at the top of the table for the majority of the season – Wednesday became the first team to beat Spurs all season – before finally finishing in second place, which still (as of 2023) remains the club's highest post-war league finish. In 1966 the club reached its fifth FA Cup final, but they were beaten 3–2 by Everton, having led 2–0.
Off the field the club was embroiled in the <a href="British%20betting%20scandal%20of%201964">British betting scandal of 1964</a> in which three of its players, <a href="Peter%20Swan%20%28footballer%20born%201936%29">Peter Swan</a>, <a href="David%20Layne">David Layne</a> and <a href="Tony%20Kay">Tony Kay</a>, were accused of <a href="match%20fixing">match fixing</a> and <a href="sports%20betting">betting</a> against their own team in an away game at <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. The three were subsequently convicted and, on release from prison, banned from football for life. The three were reprieved in the early 1970s, with Swan and Layne returning to Hillsborough, and, though their careers were virtually over, Swan at least played some league games for The Owls.
Darkest days and the fight back to the top (1970–1984).
Wednesday were relegated at the end of the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20in%20English%20football">1969–70 season</a>; this began the darkest period in the club's history, eventually culminating in the club dropping to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for the first time in its history, and in 1976 it almost fell into the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>. It was not until the appointment of <a href="Jack%20Charlton">Jack Charlton</a> as manager in 1977 that the club started to climb back up the league pyramid. Charlton led the Owls back to the Second Division in 1980 before handing the reins to <a href="Howard%20Wilkinson">Howard Wilkinson</a>, who took the club back into the top flight in 1984, after an absence of 14 years.
Life at the top of the Premier League & European Football (1984–2000).
Wednesday enjoyed success in its return to the top flight, finishing 8th in their first season back and then 5th the season later, qualifying for European football only to be disqualified due to England's ban in Europe due to the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>.
On 15 April 1989 the club's stadium was the scene of <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">one of the worst sporting tragedies ever</a>, at the FA Cup semi-final between <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, at which 97 Liverpool fans were fatally crushed in the Leppings Lane end of the stadium. The tragedy resulted in many changes at Hillsborough and all other leading stadiums in England; it was required that terracing would be replaced with seats in stands, and that perimeter fencing should be removed.
In Ron Atkinson's first full season as manager, 1989–90, Sheffield Wednesday finished 18th in the First Division and were relegated on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>, despite the acquisition of the talented <a href="John%20Sheridan%20%28football%29">John Sheridan</a> and the fact they had pulled towards mid-table at one stage of the season. They regained promotion at the first attempt but the real highlight of the season was a League Cup final victory over Atkinson's old club Manchester United. Midfielder Sheridan scored the only goal of the game, which delivered the club's first major trophy since their FA Cup success in 1935. As of 2022 they remain the last team to win one of English football's major trophies while outside the top flight. Atkinson moved to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> shortly after promotion was achieved, and handed over the reins to 37-year-old striker <a href="Trevor%20Francis">Trevor Francis</a>.
Wednesday finished third in the First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, booking their place in the following season's UEFA Cup and becoming a founding member of the new <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a>.
1992–93 was one of the most eventful seasons in the history of Sheffield Wednesday football club. They finished seventh in the Premier League and reached the finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup, but were on the losing side to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in both games, the FA Cup final going to a replay and only settled in the last minute of extra time. This prevented the Owls from making another appearance in European competition. Still, the 1992–93 season established Sheffield Wednesday as a top club. Midfielder <a href="Chris%20Waddle">Chris Waddle</a> was voted <a href="Football%20Writers%27%20Association%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year</a>, and the strike partnership of <a href="David%20Hirst%20%28footballer%29">David Hirst</a> and <a href="Mark%20Bright">Mark Bright</a> was one of the most feared in the country. Francis was unable to achieve any more success at the club, and two seasons later he was sacked. His successor was former <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton</a>, <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester</a> and <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham</a> manager <a href="David%20Pleat">David Pleat</a>.
David Pleat's first season as Sheffield Wednesday manager was frustrating, as they finished 15th in the Premiership despite an expensively-assembled line-up which included the likes of <a href="Marc%20Degryse">Marc Degryse</a>, <a href="Dejan%20Stefanovic">Dejan Stefanovic</a> and <a href="Darko%20Kovacevic">Darko Kovacevic</a> – who all had disappointing and short-lived tenures at the club. An excellent start to the 1996–97 season saw the Owls top the Premiership after winning their first four games, and David Pleat was credited <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%20Manager%20of%20the%20Month">Manager of the Month</a> for August 1996. But the club failed to mount a serious title challenge and they faded away to finish seventh in the final table. Pleat was sacked the following November with the club struggling at the wrong end of the Premiership, and Ron Atkinson briefly returned to steer the Owls clear of relegation.
At the end of the 1997–98 season, Ron Atkinson's short-term contract was not renewed and Sheffield Wednesday turned to the <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> boss <a href="Danny%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201960%29">Danny Wilson</a> as their new manager, after being rejected by both <a href="Gerard%20Houllier">Gerard Houllier</a> and <a href="Walter%20Smith">Walter Smith</a> who joined <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> respectively. Wilson's first season at the helm brought a slight improvement as they finished 12th in the Premiership.
Modern highs and lows (2000–2014).
An expensively assembled squad including <a href="Paolo%20Di%20Canio">Paolo Di Canio</a>, <a href="Benito%20Carbone">Benito Carbone</a> and <a href="Wim%20Jonk">Wim Jonk</a> failed to live up to the massive wage bill the club was paying and things eventually came to a head when Italian firebrand Di Canio was sent off in a match against Arsenal and proceeded to push the referee on his way off. Danny Wilson was sacked the following March with relegation looking a certainty for the Hillsborough club, following a disastrous <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20FA%20Premier%20League">1999–2000 season</a> where they had been hammered 8–0 by <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> as early as September. His assistant <a href="Peter%20Shreeves">Peter Shreeves</a> took temporary charge but was unable to stave off relegation, with a 3–3 draw at Arsenal in May 2000 being enough to see the Owls tumble into the First Division.
Having spent large sums building squads that were ultimately ineffective, the club's finances took a turn for the worse, and in 2003 they were relegated for a second time in four years, to the Second Division.
The club spent two years in the third tier before returning the Championship, <a href="Paul%20Sturrock">Paul Sturrock</a>'s side won the <a href="2005%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">2005 play-off final</a> by defeating <a href="Hartlepool%20United%20F.C.">Hartlepool United</a> 4–2 after extra time at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a>. Ultimately however, the club's perilous financial position ensured another drop to League One was not too far away – five years after the play-off win of 2005, the Owls were again relegated to League One.
Between July and November 2010, Sheffield Wednesday faced a series of <a href="liquidation">winding up</a> orders for unpaid tax and <a href="VAT">VAT</a> bills, with the club's existence under severe threat. It was not until 29 November 2010, when businessman <a href="Milan%20Mandari%C4%87">Milan Mandarić</a> agreed to buy out the old owners, that the club could move forward.
Mandarić appointed former Wednesday player <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a> as manager partway through the 2010–11 season, and while Megson only stayed in the job for a year, what was mostly his side won promotion back to the Championship in May 2012, under the stewardship of new manager <a href="Dave%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201956%29">Dave Jones</a>.
The Chansiri era (2014–present).
In 2014 the club was again taken over by a new owner, Thai businessman <a href="Dejphon%20Chansiri">Dejphon Chansiri</a>, purchasing the club from Milan Mandarić for £37.5m. Chansiri stated his intention to win Premier League promotion for the 2017–18 season – the football club's 150th anniversary – and came close to achieving that goal a year head of schedule, with new coach <a href="Carlos%20Carvalhal">Carlos Carvalhal</a> leading the club into the end of season play-offs at the end of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.%20season">2015–16</a> season. Wednesday were beaten in the <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20final">final</a> by <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> at <a href="Wembley">Wembley</a>. They made the play-offs again the following season, but lost on penalties to the eventually promoted <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> in the semi-final.
The club were favourites to be promoted in the 2017–18 season, but injuries and poor results saw them drop to the lower half of the table. Carvalhal left by mutual consent in December 2017, and was replaced by Dutch manager <a href="Jos%20Luhukay">Jos Luhukay</a> a month later. The team finished in an uneventful 15th place at the end of the season. Luhukay was sacked in December 2018 after a run of only one win in 10, which left the team 18th in the table. He was replaced by former <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> boss <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> who saw an upturn in form to finish 12th. However, Bruce controversially resigned in July 2019 to manage <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>.
On 6 September 2019, the club appointed former Birmingham City manager <a href="Garry%20Monk">Garry Monk</a> as the new manager, who achieved a 16th-place finish in a season that was interrupted from March to June by the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. On 31 July 2020, Sheffield Wednesday was found guilty of breaking EFL spending rules and began the 2020–21 season on -12 points, though the deficit was later reduced to -6 upon appeal. Football finance analysis site Off the Pitch named the club the worst financial performer of 185 European clubs based on its own analysis combining numerous metrics. On 9 November 2020, Monk was sacked after a poor start to the season and was replaced by <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a>. However, Pulis was also dismissed after only 45 days in charge on 28 December 2020. After a few months with <a href="Neil%20Thompson">Neil Thompson</a> as caretaker manager, <a href="Darren%20Moore">Darren Moore</a> was appointed as the club's third permanent manager of the season in March 2021. Despite taking the fight to the final day, Moore could not prevent relegation to League One come the end of the season, bringing Wednesday's nine-year spell in the Championship to an end. In <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.%20season">2022–23</a>, Wednesday won promotion back to the Championship by defeating <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> in the <a href="2023%20EFL%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">2023 play-off final</a>.
On 29 September 2023, following fan protests, owner Chansiri said he would put no more money into the club, unhappy with fans' treatment towards him and his family. While the club, sitting bottom of the Championship, was not technically up for sale, he said he would be open to offers. On 31 October 2023, Chansiri, citing cashflow problems, asked Wednesday fans to raise £2m by 10 November 2023 to help the club pay an outstanding <a href="HM%20Revenue%20and%20Customs">HMRC</a> debt and cover wages.
Nickname, kits, crest and traditions.
Nickname.
In their early years, the club was nicknamed The Blades, a term used for any sporting team from the city of Sheffield, famous the world over for its cutlery and knives. That nickname has been retained by Wednesday's crosstown rivals, <a href="Sheffield%20United">Sheffield United</a>.
Although it is widely assumed that the club's nickname changed to The Owls in 1899 after the club's move to Owlerton, it was not until 1912, when Wednesday player <a href="George%20Robertson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201885%29">George Robertson</a> presented the club with an <a href="owl">owl</a> mascot, that the name took hold. A monkey mascot introduced some years earlier had not brought much luck.
Kits.
Since its founding the club has played their home games in blue and white shirts, traditionally in vertical stripes. However, this has not always been the case and there have been variations upon the theme. A monochrome photograph from 1874 to 1875 shows the Wednesday team in plain dark shirts, while the 1871 "Rules of the Sheffield Football Association" listed the Wednesday club colours as blue and white hoops. A quartered blue and white design was used in 1887 and a blue shirt with white sleeves between 1965 and 1973. Wednesday's socks have been predominantly black, blue or white throughout their history.
The club's away strip has changed regularly over the years. Traditionally, white was the second choice for many teams, including Wednesday, although the club has used a multitude of colours for its change strip over the years, including yellow, black, silver, green and orange.
Crest.
Since 1912, the owl has become a theme that has run throughout the club. The original club crest was introduced in 1956 and consisted of a shield showing a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch. The <a href="White%20Rose%20of%20York">White Rose of York</a> was depicted below the branch alluding to the home county of <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and the <a href="wikt%3Asheaf">sheaves</a> of Sheffield "(Sheaf field)" were shown at either side of the owl's head. The club's <a href="Latin">Latin</a> motto, "Consilio et Animis", was displayed beneath the shield. This translates into English as "By Wisdom and Courage".
The crest was changed in 1970 to a minimalist version designed by a local art student, and this logo was used by the club, with variations, until 1995, when it was replaced by a similar design to the original crest. It again featured a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch although the design of both had changed. The sheaves were replaced by a stylised "SWFC" logo that had been in use on club merchandise for several years prior to the introduction of the new crest. The <a href="Yorkshire%20Rose">Yorkshire Rose</a> was moved to above the owl's head to make way for the words "Sheffield Wednesday". The word "Hillsborough" was also curved around the top of the design. The club motto was absent on the new design. The crest was encased in a new shape of shield. This crest remained in use for only a few years, during which several versions were used with different colours, including a white crest with blue stripes down either side and the colouring of the detail inverted.
In 1999, the minimalist version was brought back, albeit inside a crest, and with the addition of a <a href="copyright%20symbol">copyright symbol</a> in 2002. In 2016, new owner Dejphon Chansiri again changed the club crest, opting for a similar design to the 1956 badge.
Mascots.
Over the years Sheffield Wednesday have had several <a href="Owl">Owl</a>-themed matchday <a href="mascot">mascot</a>s. Originally it was Ozzie the Owl and later two further Owls, Baz & Ollie, were added. All three were replaced in 2006 by Barney Owl, a similar looking owl but with more defined eyes to make it look cuter. Ozzie Owl was reintroduced as Wednesday's main mascot during the home game with Charlton Athletic on 17 January 2009. The current mascots are Ozzie and Barney Owl. In 2012, Ollie Owl also made his return to the scene, as the club announced him Mascot for the Owls work with children in the local community.
Stadium.
Past stadiums.
Originally, Wednesday played matches at <a href="Highfield%20%28stadium%29">Highfield</a>, but moved several times before adopting a permanent ground. Other locations included <a href="Myrtle%20Road">Myrtle Road</a>, <a href="Heeley">Heeley</a> and <a href="Hunter%27s%20Bar">Hunter's Bar</a>. Major matches were played at <a href="Sheaf%20House">Sheaf House</a> or <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a>, before <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> made it their home ground. Sheffield Wednesday's first permanent home ground was at <a href="Olive%20Grove">Olive Grove</a>, a site near Queen's Road originally leased from the <a href="Henry%20Fitzalan-Howard%2C%2015th%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a>. The first game at Olive Grove was a 4–4 draw with <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> on 12 September 1887. Extensions to the adjacent railway forced the club to move to their current ground in 1899.
Hillsborough Stadium.
Since 1899 Wednesday have played their home games at <a href="Hillsborough%20Stadium">Hillsborough Stadium</a> in the <a href="Owlerton">Owlerton</a> district of Sheffield. The stadium was originally named Owlerton Stadium but in 1914 Owlerton became part of the parliamentary constituency of <a href="Sheffield%20Hillsborough%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Hillsborough</a> and the ground took on its current name. With 39,732 seats, Hillsborough has the <a href="List%20of%20stadiums%20in%20England">12th highest</a> capacity in England. The club had intended to increase Hillsborough's capacity to 44,825 by 2012 and 50,000 by 2016 and make several other improvements in the process, but due to England's failed World Cup bid, this is now not the case.
The stadium has hosted <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> football in <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966</a>, the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201996">1996 European Championships</a> and 27 <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-finals. The Kop at Hillsborough was re-opened in 1986 by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> and was once the largest covered stand of any football stadium in Europe.
On 15 April 1989, at an FA Cup semi-final between <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, 94 Liverpool fans (later increasing to 97) were crushed to death after the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of the ground became overcrowded, in what became known as the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a>. The following report concluded that the root cause of the disaster was the failure of local police to adequately manage the crowds. A memorial to the victims of the disaster stands outside Hillsborough's South Stand, near the main entrance on Parkside Road. After many years of dispute about the facts, in June 2017 six men responsible for safety were charged with criminal offences including manslaughter and misconduct in public office.
Supporters.
The club's move to <a href="Owlerton">Owlerton</a> in 1899 was a risky one, as it moved the club several miles away from the city centre, but its loyal followers continued to make the journey to the new ground, and the club has been one of the best supported in England ever since. However, official attendances were not taken at Football League games until the 1920s.
The club's highest average attendance over the course of a season was 42,530 in 1952–53, when gates across the country were at their highest. The lowest average attendance in the Owls' history came in 1978–79, when an average of just 10,643 fans turned out to watch their side.
In 1992, Wednesday were the fourth best supported team in the country, but although that ranking has come down since relegation from the Premier League in 2000, the club still has still enjoyed crowds of well over 20,000 since then, and was the best supported club outside the top flight in 2006.
At the <a href="2005%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">2005 play-off final</a>, Wednesday took over 39,000 fans to the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a>. In 2016, Sheffield Wednesday took over 38,000 fans to Wembley for a play-off final defeat by Hull City. The Owls have managed to average 30,000 at home in the last 60 years. The FA Cup final seasons in 1965–66 30000 and 1966–67 31,000 plus 32,000 when coming League Championship runners-up in 1960–61.
Sheffield Wednesday have had a large variety of <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s over the years; examples include "Just Another Wednesday", "Out of the Blue", "Spitting Feathers", "Boddle", "A View From The East Bank", "Cheat!" and "<a href="War%20of%20the%20Monster%20Trucks">War of the Monster Trucks</a>", which acquired its name from the programme that <a href="Yorkshire%20Television">Yorkshire Television</a> elected to show instead of the celebrations after the <a href="1991%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1991 League Cup</a> victory over Manchester United.
There are several online message boards dedicated to discussions on the club, including "Owlstalk", "OwlsOnline" and "OwlsMad".
Rivalry.
Sheffield Wednesday's main rivals are city neighbours <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>. Matches between these two clubs are nicknamed <a href="Steel%20City%20derby">Steel City derbies</a>, so called because of the steel industry for which the city of <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> is famous.
United were formed in 1889 by the committee at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a>, who had lost their biggest source of income – Wednesday – two years earlier over a dispute concerning pitch rent. As well as playing at Wednesday's former ground, United also took Wednesday's former nickname, the Blades, as their own. The first derby game took place on 15 December 1890, with Wednesday winning 2–1 at <a href="Olive%20Grove">Olive Grove</a>.
The 1993 <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-final match which took place at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> on 3 April 1993. Initially, it was announced that the match was scheduled to take place at <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a> but this was met with dismay by both sets of fans. After a re-think, <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> decided to switch venue to Wembley. A crowd of 75,365 supporters made the trip to London to watch Wednesday beat United 2–1 after extra time.
A survey conducted in 2019 revealed that, as well as <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, Wednesday fans consider fellow-<a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> sides <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>, <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a>, <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a> and <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a> as rivals.

Only managers with over 200 games in charge are included. For the complete list see <a href="List%20of%20Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.%20managers">List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. managers</a>.
Dickinson, who was in charge for 29 years, is Wednesday's longest-serving manager, and helped establish the club during the first two decades of the 20th century.
Brown succeeded Dickinson and remained in charge for 13 years; in 1930 he secured their most recent top division league title to date.
Taylor took over during the Second World War and remained in charge until 1958, but failed to win a major trophy, even though Wednesday were in the top flight for most of his reign.
Charlton took Wednesday out of the Third Division in 1980 and in his final season (<a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1982–83</a>) he took them to the semi-finals of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>.
Wilkinson succeeded Charlton in the summer of 1983 and was in charge for more than five years before he moved to <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>. His first season saw Wednesday gain promotion to the First Division after a 14-year exile. He guided them to a fifth-place finish in 1986, but Wednesday were unable to compete in the 1986–87 <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> due to the ban on English teams in European competitions due to the <a href="Heysel%20Disaster">Heysel Disaster</a> of 1985.
Under <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a>, Wednesday won the League Cup and promotion to the First Division before departing for <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> in July 1991. <a href="Trevor%20Francis">Trevor Francis</a> was appointed as player-manager and guided them to third place in the league in 1992, and earned them a <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> place. They finished seventh in the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">inaugural</a> <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> season and were runners-up of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> and League Cup that year. He was sacked in 1995 after Wednesday finished 13th – their lowest standing in four years since winning promotion.
Records and statistics.
Wednesday's biggest recorded win was a 12–0 home victory over <a href="Halliwell%20F.C.">Halliwell</a> in the first round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> on 18 January 1891. The biggest league win was a 9–1 victory at home to <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham</a> in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> on 13 December 1930. Wednesday's heaviest defeat was a 10–0 defeat at <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> in a First Division match on 5 October 1912.
The most goals scored by the club in a season was the 106 scored in the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59 season</a>. The club accumulated their highest league points total in the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.%20season">2022–23</a> season when they racked up 96 points. The highest home attendance was in the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> fifth round on 17 February 1934. A total of 72,841 turned up to see a 2–2 draw with <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. The most-<a href="cap%20%28sport%29">capped</a> Englishman to play for the club was goalkeeper <a href="Ron%20Springett">Ron Springett</a>, who won 33 caps while at Sheffield Wednesday. Springett also held the overall record for most-capped Sheffield Wednesday player until <a href="Nigel%20Worthington">Nigel Worthington</a> broke the record, eventually gaining a total of 50 caps for <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland</a> whilst at the club.
The fastest sending off in British league football is held by Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper <a href="Kevin%20Pressman">Kevin Pressman</a> – who was sent off after just 13 seconds for handling a shot from Wolverhampton Wanderers's <a href="Temuri%20Ketsbaia">Temuri Ketsbaia</a> outside the area during the opening weekend of 2000. The fastest shot ever recorded in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> was hit by David Hirst against Arsenal at Highbury in September 1996 – Hirst hit the bar with a shot clocked at .

Liverpool F.C.

Liverpool Football Club is a professional <a href="Football%20club%20%28association%20football%29">football club</a> based in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, England. The club competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the top tier of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a>. Founded in 1892, the club joined the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> the following year and has played its home games at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> since its formation. 
Domestically, the club has won 19 <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions%23Total%20titles%20won">league titles</a>, eight <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, a record nine <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cups</a> and 16 <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>s. In international competitions, the club <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%20in%20international%20football">has won</a> six <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cups</a>, three <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cups</a>, four <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>s—all English records—and one <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>. The club established itself as a major force in domestic and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a>, <a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a>, <a href="Joe%20Fagan">Joe Fagan</a> and <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a>, led the club to a combined 11 League titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in <a href="2005%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2005</a> and <a href="2019%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2019</a> under the management of <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a> and <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a>, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th league title in <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">2020</a>, the club's first during the Premier League era.
Liverpool is <a href="Forbes%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs">one of the most valuable</a> and widely supported clubs in the world. The club has long-standing rivalries with <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">Manchester United</a> and <a href="Merseyside%20derby">Everton</a>. Under management by Shankly, in 1964 the team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is "<a href="You%27ll%20Never%20Walk%20Alone">You'll Never Walk Alone</a>".
The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>, where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Final</a> in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths. Most of these were Italians and <a href="Juventus">Juventus</a> fans. Liverpool were given a six-year ban from European competition, and all other English clubs received a five-year ban. The <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a <a href="Human%20stampede">crush</a> against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced <a href="Terrace%20%28stadium%29">standing terraces</a> in favour of <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a>s in the top two tiers of English football. Prolonged campaigning for justice saw further coroners inquests, commissions and independent panels that ultimately exonerated the fans.
History.
Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> committee and <a href="John%20Houlding">John Houlding</a>, club president and owner of the land at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a> in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield. Originally named "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> refused to recognise the club as Everton.
Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly match</a> against <a href="Rotherham%20Town%20F.C.%20%281878%29">Rotherham Town</a>, which they won 7–1. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players—the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the <a href="Scotch%20Professors">Scotch Professors</a>. <a href="List%20of%20Liverpool%20F.C.%20managers">Manager</a> <a href="John%20McKenna">John McKenna</a> had recruited the players after a <a href="Scout%20%28sport%29">scouting</a> trip to Scotland—so they became known as the "team of Macs". The team won the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28football%29">Lancashire League</a> in its debut season and joined the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a> at the start of the 1893–94 season. After the club was promoted to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1896, <a href="Tom%20Watson%20%28football%20manager%29">Tom Watson</a> was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.
Liverpool reached its first <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> in <a href="1914%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1914</a>, losing 1–0 to <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-<a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> centre half <a href="George%20Kay%20%28footballer%29">George Kay</a>. Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal. The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season. Soon after Liverpool lost 2–1 to non-league <a href="Worcester%20City%20F.C.">Worcester City</a> in the 1958–59 FA Cup, <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a> was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24 players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other "<a href="The%20Boot%20Room">Boot Room</a>" members <a href="Joe%20Fagan">Joe Fagan</a>, <a href="Reuben%20Bennett">Reuben Bennett</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Paisley">Bob Paisley</a> began reshaping the team.
The club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964, for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, the club won its <a href="1965%20FA%20Cup%20Final">first FA Cup</a>. In 1966, the club won the First Division but lost to <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> in the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> final. Liverpool won both the League and the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> during the 1972–73 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley. In 1976, Paisley's second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season, the club retained the League title and won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979. During Paisley's nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 20 trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cups</a>; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup.
Paisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan. Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season. Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against <a href="Juventus">Juventus</a> at the <a href="King%20Baudouin%20Stadium">Heysel Stadium</a>. Before kick-off, Liverpool fans breached a fence that separated the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>. The match was played in spite of protests by both managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. As a result of the tragedy, English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years; Liverpool received a ten-year ban, which was later reduced to six years. Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter.
Fagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> was appointed as <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a>. During his tenure, the club won another three league titles and two FA Cups, including a League and Cup "<a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">Double</a>" in the 1985–86 season. Liverpool's success was overshadowed by the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a>: in an FA Cup semi-final against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> on 15 April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing. Ninety-four fans died that day; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later, the 96th died nearly four years later, without regaining consciousness, and the 97th, Andrew Devine, died of injuries sustained in the disaster in 2021. After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety. The resulting <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> paved the way for legislation that required top-division teams to have all-seater stadiums. The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control.
Liverpool was involved in the closest finish to a league season during the 1988–89 season. Liverpool finished equal with <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> on both points and goal difference, but lost the title on total goals scored when Arsenal scored the final goal in the <a href="Liverpool%200%E2%80%932%20Arsenal%20%2826%20May%201989%29">last minute of the season</a>.
Dalglish cited the Hillsborough disaster and its repercussions as the reason for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a>. Under his leadership Liverpool won the <a href="1992%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1992 FA Cup Final</a>, but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by <a href="Roy%20Evans">Roy Evans</a>, and Liverpool went on to win the 1995 Football League Cup Final. While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were the best they could manage, and so <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Houllier">Gérard Houllier</a> was appointed co-manager in the 1998–99 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned. In 2001, Houllier's second full season in charge, Liverpool won a "<a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a>": the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal. They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.
Houllier was replaced by <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a> at the end of the 2003–04 season. Despite finishing fifth in Benítez's first season, Liverpool won the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2004–05 UEFA Champions League</a>, beating <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> 3–2 in a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootout</a> after the match ended with a score of 3–3. The following season, Liverpool finished third in the Premier League and won the 2006 FA Cup Final, beating <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3–3. American businessmen <a href="George%20N.%20Gillett%20Jr.">George Gillett</a> and <a href="Tom%20Hicks">Tom Hicks</a> became the owners of the club during the 2006–07 season, in a deal which valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million. The club reached the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan, as it had in 2005, but lost 2–1. During the 2008–09 season Liverpool achieved 86 points, its then-highest Premier League points total, prior to the record-breaking 2018–19 season, and finished as runners up to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>.
In the 2009–10 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Benítez subsequently left by mutual consent and was replaced by <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> manager <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a>. At the start of the 2010–11 season Liverpool was on the verge of bankruptcy and the club's creditors asked the High Court to allow the sale of the club, overruling the wishes of Hicks and Gillett. <a href="John%20W.%20Henry">John W. Henry</a>, owner of the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> and of <a href="Fenway%20Sports%20Group">Fenway Sports Group</a>, bid successfully for the club and took ownership in October 2010. Poor results during the start of that season led to Hodgson leaving the club by mutual consent and former player and manager Kenny Dalglish taking over. In the 2011–12 season, Liverpool secured a record 8th League Cup success and reached the FA Cup final, but finished in eighth position, the worst league finish in 18 years; this led to the sacking of Dalglish. He was replaced by <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a>, whose Liverpool team in the 2013–14 season mounted an unexpected title charge to finish second behind champions <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> and subsequently return to the Champions League, scoring 101 goals in the process, the most since the 106 scored in the <a href="1895%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1895–96</a> season. Following a disappointing 2014–15 season, where Liverpool finished sixth in the league, and a poor start to the following campaign, Rodgers was sacked in October 2015.
Rodgers was replaced by <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a>. Liverpool reached the finals of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> and <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> in Klopp's first season, finishing as runner-up in both competitions. The club finished second in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Premier%20League">2018–19 season</a> with 97 points (surpassing the 86 points gained during the 2008–09 season), losing only one game: a points record for a non-title winning side. Klopp took Liverpool to successive Champions League finals in 2018 and 2019, with the club defeating <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 2–0 to win the <a href="2019%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2019 UEFA Champions League Final</a>. Liverpool beat <a href="Clube%20de%20Regatas%20do%20Flamengo">Flamengo</a> of Brazil in the <a href="2019%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a> 1–0 to win the <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a> for the first time. Liverpool then went on to win the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">2019–20 Premier League</a>, winning their first top-flight league title in thirty years. The club set multiple records in the season, including winning the league with seven games remaining making it the earliest any team has ever won the title, amassing a club record 99 points, and achieving a <a href="Football%20records%20and%20statistics%20in%20England%23Wins">joint-record</a> 32 wins in a top-flight season. In January 2024, Klopp announced that he would leave the club at the end of the season.
Colours and badge.
For much of Liverpool's history, its home colours have been all red. When the club was founded in 1892, blue and white quartered shirts were used until the club adopted the city's colour of red in 1896. The city's symbol of the <a href="liver%20bird">liver bird</a> was adopted as the club's badge (or <a href="Crest%20%28sports%29">crest</a>, as it is sometimes known) in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955. Liverpool continued to wear red shirts and white shorts until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to change to an all-red strip. Liverpool played in all red for the first time against <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>, as <a href="Ian%20St%20John">Ian St John</a> recalled in his autobiography:
The Liverpool away strip has more often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was introduced in 1987, which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and <a href="ecru">ecru</a>, the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the current away kit clashes with a team's home kit. Between 2012 and 2015, the kits were designed by <a href="Warrior%20Sports">Warrior Sports</a>, who became the club's kit providers at the start of the 2012–13 season. In February 2015, Warrior's parent company <a href="New%20Balance">New Balance</a> announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance. The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> until 1985, when they were replaced by <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>, who produced the kits until 1996 when <a href="Reebok">Reebok</a> took over. They produced the kits for 10 years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012. <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> became the club's official kit supplier at the start of the 2020–21 season.
Liverpool was the first English professional club to have a sponsor's logo on its shirts, after agreeing a deal with <a href="Hitachi%2C%20Ltd.">Hitachi</a> in 1979. However for the first few years of the deal, broadcasting rules meant that sponsors logos could not be shown on shirts for televised matches. 
Since then the club has been sponsored by <a href="Crown%20Paints">Crown Paints</a>, <a href="Candy%20%28company%29">Candy</a>, <a href="Carlsberg%20Group">Carlsberg</a> and <a href="Standard%20Chartered">Standard Chartered</a>. The contract with Carlsberg, which was signed in 1992, was the longest-lasting agreement in English top-flight football. The association with Carlsberg ended at the start of the 2010–11 season, when Standard Chartered Bank became the club's sponsor.
The Liverpool badge is based on the city's liver bird symbol, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1977, a red liver bird standing on a football (blazoned as "Statant upon a football a Liver Bird wings elevated and addorsed holding in the beak a piece of seaweed gules") was granted as a <a href="heraldic%20badge">heraldic badge</a> by the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> intended for use by Liverpool. However, Liverpool never made use of this badge. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, including a representation of the <a href="Shankly%20Gates">Shankly Gates</a>. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an <a href="eternal%20flame">eternal flame</a> burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.
Stadium.
Anfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to <a href="Stanley%20Park%2C%20Liverpool">Stanley Park</a>.
Situated 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool city centre, it was originally used by Everton before the club moved to <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a> after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding. Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.
The Kop was built in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0. In 1906 the banked stand at one end of the ground was formally renamed the <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadiums%29">Spion Kop</a> after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal. The hill was the site of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Spion%20Kop">Battle of Spion Kop</a> in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool. At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadiums in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it could hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.
Anfield could accommodate more than 60,000 supporters at its peak and had a capacity of 55,000 until the 1990s, when, following recommendations from the "Taylor Report", all clubs in the Premier League were obliged to convert to all-seater stadiums in time for the 1993–94 season, reducing its capacity to 45,276. The findings of the report precipitated the redevelopment of the Kemlyn Road Stand, which was rebuilt in 1992, coinciding with the centenary of the club, and was known as the Centenary Stand until 2017 when it was renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand. An extra tier was added to the Anfield Road end in 1998, which further increased the capacity of the ground but gave rise to problems when it was opened. A series of support poles and stanchions were inserted to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand after movement of the tier was reported at the start of the 1999–2000 season.
Because of restrictions on expanding the capacity at Anfield, Liverpool announced plans to move to the proposed <a href="Stanley%20Park%20Stadium">Stanley Park Stadium</a> in May 2002. Planning permission was granted in July 2004, and in September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool a <a href="999-year%20lease">999-year lease</a> on the proposed site. Following the takeover of the club by George Gillett and Tom Hicks in February 2007, the proposed stadium was redesigned. The new design was approved by the Council in November 2007. The stadium was scheduled to open in August 2011 and would hold 60,000 spectators, with <a href="HKS%2C%20Inc.">HKS, Inc.</a> contracted to build the stadium. Construction was halted in August 2008, as Gillett and Hicks had difficulty in financing the £300 million needed for the development. In October 2012, BBC Sport reported that Fenway Sports Group, the new owners of Liverpool FC, had decided to redevelop their current home at Anfield stadium, rather than building a new stadium in Stanley Park. As part of the redevelopment the capacity of Anfield was to increase from 45,276 to approximately 60,000 and would cost approximately £150m. When construction was completed on the new Main stand the capacity of Anfield was increased to 54,074. This £100 million expansion added a third tier to the stand. This was all part of a £260 million project to improve the Anfield area. Jürgen Klopp the manager at the time described the stand as "impressive."
In June 2021, it was reported that Liverpool Council had given planning permission for the club to renovate and expand the Anfield Road stand, boosting the capacity by around 7,000 and taking the overall capacity at Anfield to 61,000. The expansion, which is estimated to cost £60m, was described as "a huge milestone" by managing director Andy Hughes, and would also see rail seating being trialled in the Kop for the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Premier%20League">2021–22 Premier League</a> season.
Support.
Liverpool is one of the best supported clubs in the world. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes 300 officially recognised Supporters Clubs in 100 different countries. Notable groups include <a href="Spirit%20of%20Shankly">Spirit of Shankly</a>. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours, which has included playing in front of 101,000 in Michigan, U.S., and 95,000 in Melbourne, Australia. Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, <a href="A.F.C.%20Liverpool">A.F.C. Liverpool</a>, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.
The song "<a href="You%27ll%20Never%20Walk%20Alone">You'll Never Walk Alone</a>", originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Carousel" and later recorded by Liverpool musicians <a href="Gerry%20and%20the%20Pacemakers">Gerry and the Pacemakers</a>, is the club's anthem and has been sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s. It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world. The song's title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The "You'll Never Walk Alone" portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the club's badge.
The club's supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 people, mostly Italians and Juventus supporters, were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters, and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990. Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial. In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14 Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter; half of the terms were suspended.
The second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989. Ninety-seven Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the following days, <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster%20and%20The%20Sun">"The Sun"s coverage of the event</a> spread falsehoods, particularly an article entitled "The Truth" that claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated on and attacked the police. Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy "The Sun" 30 years later. Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice.
Rivalries.
Liverpool's longest-established rivalry is with fellow Liverpool team Everton, against whom they contest the <a href="Merseyside%20derby">Merseyside derby</a>. The rivalry stems from Liverpool's formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield. The Merseyside derby is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation, and hence has been known as the "friendly derby". Since the mid-1980s, the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and, since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, the Merseyside derby has had more players <a href="Ejection%20%28sports%29">sent off</a> than any other Premier League game. It has been referred to as "the most ill-disciplined and explosive fixture in the Premier League". In terms of support within the city, the number of Liverpool fans outweighs Everton supporters by a ratio of 2:1.
Liverpool's <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">rivalry with Manchester United</a> stems from the cities' competition in the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> of the 19th century. Connected by the <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">world's first inter-city railway</a>, by road Liverpool and Manchester are separated by approximately 30 miles (48 km) along the <a href="East%20Lancs%20Road">East Lancs Road</a>. Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by "<a href="France%20Football">France Football</a>" magazine, Liverpool and Manchester United are the most successful English teams in both domestic and international competitions, and both clubs have a global fanbase. Viewed as one of the biggest rivalries in world football, it is considered the most famous fixture in English football. The two clubs alternated as champions between <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1964</a> and <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1967</a>, and Manchester United became the first English team to win the European Cup in <a href="1968%20European%20Cup%20Final">1968</a>, followed by Liverpool's four European Cup victories. Despite the 39 league titles and nine European Cups between them the two rivals have rarely been successful at the same time – Liverpool's run of titles in the 1970s and 1980s coincided with Manchester United's 26-year title drought, and United's success in the Premier League-era likewise coincided with Liverpool's 30-year title drought, and the two clubs have finished first and second in the league only five times. Such is the rivalry between the clubs they rarely do transfer business with each other. The last player to be transferred between the two clubs was <a href="Phil%20Chisnall">Phil Chisnall</a>, who moved to Liverpool from Manchester United in 1964.
Ownership and finances.
As the owner of Anfield and founder of Liverpool, John Houlding was the club's first chairman, a position he held from its founding in 1892 until 1904. <a href="John%20McKenna">John McKenna</a> took over as chairman after Houlding's departure. McKenna subsequently became President of the Football League. The chairmanship changed hands many times before <a href="John%20Smith%20%28football%20chairman%29">John Smith</a>, whose father was a shareholder of the club, took up the role in 1973. He oversaw the most successful period in Liverpool's history before stepping down in 1990. His successor was <a href="Noel%20White">Noel White</a> who became chairman in 1990. In August 1991 <a href="David%20Moores">David Moores</a>, whose family had owned the club for more than 50 years, became chairman. His uncle <a href="John%20Moores%20%28merchant%29">John Moores</a> was also a shareholder at Liverpool and was chairman of Everton from 1961 to 1973. Moores owned 51 percent of the club, and in 2004 expressed his willingness to consider a bid for his shares in Liverpool.
Moores eventually sold the club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9 million. The pair paid £5,000 per share, or £174.1m for the total shareholding and £44.8m to cover the club's debts. Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club. <a href="Martin%20Broughton">Martin Broughton</a> was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale. In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of the club to be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor <a href="KPMG">KPMG</a> to qualify its audit opinion. The group's creditors, including the <a href="Royal%20Bank%20of%20Scotland">Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, took Gillett and Hicks to court to force them to allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, <a href="Christopher%20Floyd">Mr Justice Floyd</a>, ruled in favour of the creditors and paved the way for the sale of the club to <a href="Fenway%20Sports%20Group">Fenway Sports Group</a> (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal. Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for £300m.
Liverpool has been described as a global brand; a 2010 report valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £141m, an increase of £5m on the previous year. Liverpool was given a brand rating of AA (Very Strong). In April 2010 business magazine "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" ranked Liverpool as the sixth most valuable football team in the world, behind <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a>, <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, Arsenal, <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>; they valued the club at $822m (£532m), excluding debt. Accountants <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a> ranked Liverpool eighth in the <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">Deloitte Football Money League</a>, which ranks the world's football clubs in terms of revenue. Liverpool's income in the 2009–10 season was €225.3m. According to a 2018 report by Deloitte, the club had an annual revenue of €424.2 million for the previous year, and "Forbes" valued the club at $1.944 billion. In 2018, annual revenue increased to €513.7 million, and "Forbes" valued the club at $2.183 billion. In 2019 revenue increased to €604 million (£533 million) according to Deloitte, with the club breaching the half a billion pounds mark.
In April 2020, the owners of the club came under fire from fans and the media for deciding to <a href="furlough">furlough</a> all non-playing staff during the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. In response to this, the club made a U-turn on the decision and apologised for their initial decision. In April 2021 "Forbes" valued the club at $4.1 billion, a two-year increase of 88%, making it the world's <a href="Forbes%27%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs">fifth-most-valuable</a> football club. Based on the latest rankings by "Forbes", as of May 2023, Liverpool is ranked as the fourth most valuable football club in the world, behind Real Madrid, Manchester United and Barcelona; they valued the club at $5.29 billion, an increase of 19% from 2022.
Liverpool in the media.
Liverpool featured in the first edition of BBC's "<a href="Match%20of%20the%20Day">Match of the Day</a>", which screened highlights of their match against Arsenal at Anfield on 22 August 1964. The first football match to be televised in colour was between Liverpool and West Ham United, broadcast live in March 1967. Liverpool fans featured in the <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> song "<a href="Fearless%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Fearless</a>", in which they sang excerpts from "You'll Never Walk Alone".

A <a href="Hillsborough%20%281996%20film%29">docudrama on the Hillsborough disaster</a>, written by <a href="Jimmy%20McGovern">Jimmy McGovern</a>, was screened in 1996. It featured <a href="Christopher%20Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a> as Trevor Hicks, who lost two teenage daughters in the disaster, went on to campaign for safer stadiums and helped to form the Hillsborough Families Support Group. Liverpool featured in the 2001 film "<a href="The%2051st%20State">The 51st State</a>", in which ex-hitman Felix DeSouza (<a href="Robert%20Carlyle">Robert Carlyle</a>) is a keen supporter of the team and the last scene takes place at a match between Liverpool and Manchester United.

Luton Town was the first in southern England to turn professional. It joined the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> before the <a href="1897%E2%80%9398%20Football%20League">1897–98 season</a>, left in 1900 because of financial problems, and rejoined in 1920.

The team was then relegated from the top division in <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20in%20English%20football">1959–60</a>, and demoted twice more in the following five years, playing in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> from the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20in%20English%20football">1965–66 season</a>, before they were promoted back to the top level in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1974–75</a>.
In <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Football%20League">1981–82</a>, the club won the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> and gained promotion to the First. Luton defeated <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 3–2 in the <a href="1988%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1988 Football League Cup final</a> and remained in the First Division until relegation at the end of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1991–92 season</a>. Between 2007 and 2009, financial difficulties caused the club to fall from the second tier of English football to the fifth in successive seasons. The last of these relegations, in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 season</a>, followed a 30-point deduction for financial irregularities. Luton spent five seasons in <a href="non-League%20football">non-League football</a> before winning the <a href="Conference%20Premier">Conference Premier</a> in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a>, securing promotion back into the Football League. Luton were promoted from <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> and <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> in successive seasons in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2017–18</a> and <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2018–19</a> before being promoted to the Premier League in the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20EFL%20Championship">2022–23 EFL Championship</a> play-off final on penalties against <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>.
Luton Town are the first football team to return to the top tier of English football after successive relegations down to the fifth tier of English football.
History.
Formation and election to the Southern League (1885–1890).
Luton Town Football Club was formed on 11 April 1885. Before this there were many clubs in the town, the most prominent of which were Luton Wanderers and Luton Excelsior. A Wanderers player, George Deacon, came up with the idea of a 'Town' club which would include all the best players in Luton. Wanderers secretary Herbert Spratley seized upon Deacon's idea and arranged a secret meeting on 13 January 1885 at the St Matthews school rooms in <a href="High%20Town%2C%20Luton">High Town</a>. The Wanderers committee resolved to rename the club Luton Town—which was not well received by the wider community. The local newspapers referred to the club as 'Luton Town (late Wanderers)'. When George Deacon and John Charles Lomax then arranged a public meeting with the purpose of forming a 'Luton Town Football Club', Spratley protested, saying there was already a Luton Town club; and the atmosphere was tense when the meeting convened in the town hall on 11 April 1885. The meeting, attended by most football lovers in the town, heard about Spratley's secret January meeting and voted down his objections. The motion to form a 'Luton Town Football Club', put forward by G H Small and seconded by E H Lomax, was carried. A club committee was elected by ballot and the team colours were agreed to be pink and dark blue shirts and caps.
Initially based at Excelsior's <a href="Dallow%20Lane">Dallow Lane</a> ground, Luton Town began making payments to certain individual players in 1890. The following year, Luton became the first club in southern England to be fully professional. The club was a founder member of the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern Football League</a> in the 1894–95 season and finished as runners-up in its first two seasons. It then left to help form the <a href="United%20League%20%28football%29">United League</a> and came second in that league's inaugural season before joining <a href="English%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> (then based mostly in northern and central England) for <a href="1897%E2%80%9398%20Football%20League">1897–98</a>, concurrently moving to a new ground at <a href="Dunstable%20Road">Dunstable Road</a>. The club continued to enter a team to the United League for two more seasons, winning the title in 1897–98. Poor attendance, high wages, in addition to the high travel and accommodation costs that resulted from Luton's distance from the northern heartlands of the Football League crippled the club financially; it became too expensive to compete in that league. A return to the Southern League was therefore arranged for the <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20Southern%20Football%20League">1900–01 season</a>.
Early 20th century (1900–1950).
Eight years after arriving at Dunstable Road, Luton moved again, settling at their current ground, <a href="Kenilworth%20Road">Kenilworth Road</a>, in 1905. <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">Captain</a> and <a href="Midfielder%23Winger">left winger</a> <a href="Robert%20Hawkes">Bob Hawkes</a> became Luton's first international player when he was picked to play for <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> against <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Ireland</a> on 16 February 1907. A poor <a href="1911%E2%80%9312%20Southern%20Football%20League">1911–12 season</a> saw Luton relegated to the Southern League's Second Division; the club won promotion back two years later. After the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> broke out, Luton took part in <a href="The%20Football%20Combination">The London Combination</a> during <a href="1915%E2%80%9316%20in%20English%20football">1915–16</a>, and afterwards filled each season with <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly matches</a>. A key player of the period was <a href="Ernie%20Simms">Ernie Simms</a>, a <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">forward</a>. Simms was invalided back to England after being wounded on the <a href="Italian%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Italian front</a>, but recovered enough to regain his place in the Luton team and scored 40 goals during the <a href="1916%E2%80%9317%20in%20English%20football">1916–17 season</a>.
The Luton side first played in the white and black colours which it has retained for much of its history during the <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">1920–21 season</a>, when the club rejoined the Football League; the players had previously worn an assortment of colour combinations, most permanently <a href="sky%20blue">sky blue</a> shirts with white shorts and navy socks. Such was the quality of Luton's team at this time that despite playing in the third tier, a fixture between Ireland and England at <a href="Windsor%20Park">Windsor Park</a> on 22 October 1921 saw three Luton players on the pitch—<a href="Louis%20Bookman">Louis Bookman</a> and <a href="Allan%20Mathieson">Allan Mathieson</a> for Ireland, and the club's top goalscorer, Simms, for England. However, after Luton finished fourth in the division, the squad was broken up as Simms, Bookman and Mathieson joined <a href="South%20Shields%20F.C.%20%281889%29">South Shields</a>, <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a> and <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> respectively. Luton stayed in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> until <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20in%20English%20football">1936–37</a>, when the team finished top and won promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, at that time the second tier of English football. During the promotion season, <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> <a href="Joe%20Payne%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201914%29">Joe Payne</a> scored 55 goals in 39 games; during the previous season he had scored 10 in one match against <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>, which remains a Football League record today.
Success under Duncan and relegation (1950–1965).
During the early 1950s, one of Luton's greatest sides emerged under manager <a href="Dally%20Duncan">Dally Duncan</a>. The team included <a href="Gordon%20Turner">Gordon Turner</a>, who went on to become Luton's all-time top goalscorer, <a href="Bob%20Morton%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201927%29">Bob Morton</a>, who holds the record for the most club appearances, and <a href="Syd%20Owen">Syd Owen</a>, an England international. During this period, Luton sides also featured two England international goalkeepers, <a href="Ron%20Baynham">Ron Baynham</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Streten">Bernard Streten</a>, as well as <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Irish internationals</a> <a href="Seamus%20Dunne">Seamus Dunne</a>, <a href="Tom%20Aherne">Tom Aherne</a> and <a href="George%20Cummins%20%28footballer%29">George Cummins</a>. This team reached the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">top flight</a> for the first time in <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20in%20English%20football">1955–56</a>, after finishing the season in second place behind <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> on <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a>. A few years of success followed, including an <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final%201959">FA Cup Final appearance</a> against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a>; at the end of the season, Owen was voted <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a>. However, the club was relegated the following season and, by <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20in%20English%20football">1964–65</a>, was playing in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">fourth tier</a>.
Back to the first tier and late century success (1965–1992).
In <a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo club</a> fashion, Luton were to return. A team including <a href="Bruce%20Rioch">Bruce Rioch</a>, <a href="John%20Moore%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20December%201943%29">John Moore</a> and <a href="Graham%20French">Graham French</a> won the Fourth Division championship in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20in%20English%20football">1967–68</a> under the leadership of former player <a href="Allan%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201926%29">Allan Brown</a>; two years later <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a>'s goals helped them to another promotion, while comedian <a href="Eric%20Morecambe">Eric Morecambe</a> became a director of the club. Luton Town won promotion back to the First Division in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Football%20League">1973–74</a>, but were relegated <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">the following season</a> by a solitary point. Former Luton player <a href="David%20Pleat">David Pleat</a> was made manager in 1978, and by <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1982–83</a> the team was back in the top flight. The team which Pleat assembled at Kenilworth Road was notable at the time for the number of <a href="black%20people">black</a> players it included; during an era when many English squads were almost entirely white, Luton often fielded a mostly black team. Talented players such as <a href="Ricky%20Hill">Ricky Hill</a>, <a href="Brian%20Stein">Brian Stein</a> and <a href="Emeka%20Nwajiobi">Emeka Nwajiobi</a> made key contributions to the club's success during this period, causing it to accrue "a richer history of black stars than any in the country", in the words of journalist Gavin Willacy.
On the last day of the 1982–83 season, the club's first back in the top tier, it narrowly escaped relegation: playing <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> at <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a>, Luton needed to win to stay up, while City could escape with a draw. A late winner by <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavian</a> substitute <a href="Radomir%20Anti%C4%87">Raddy Antić</a> saved the team and prompted Pleat to dance across the pitch performing a "jig of joy", an image that has become <a href="icon">icon</a>ic. The club achieved its highest ever league position, seventh, under <a href="John%20Moore%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20December%201943%29">John Moore</a> in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1986–87</a>, and, managed by <a href="Ray%20Harford">Ray Harford</a>, won the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> a year later with a <a href="1988%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">3–2 win</a> over <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. With ten minutes left on the clock and Arsenal 2–1 ahead, a penalty save from stand-in goalkeeper <a href="Andy%20Dibble">Andy Dibble</a> sparked a late Luton rally: <a href="Danny%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201960%29">Danny Wilson</a> equalised, before <a href="Brian%20Stein">Brian Stein</a> scored the winner with the last kick of the match. The club reached the <a href="1989%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup Final</a> once more in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1988–89</a>, but lost 3–1 to Nottingham Forest.
Resurgence and fall to non-League (1992–2009).
The club was relegated from the top division at the end of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1991–92 season</a>, and sank to the third tier <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">four years later</a>. Luton stayed in the third-tier Second Division until relegation at the end of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2000–01 season</a>. Under the management of <a href="Joe%20Kinnear">Joe Kinnear</a>, who had arrived halfway through the previous season, the team won promotion from the fourth tier at the first attempt. "Controversial" owner <a href="John%20Gurney%20%28football%20chairman%29">John Gurney</a> unsettled the club in 2003, terminating Kinnear's contract on his arrival in May; Gurney replaced Kinnear with <a href="Mike%20Newell%20%28footballer%29">Mike Newell</a> before leaving Luton as the club entered <a href="Administration%20%28law%29">administration</a>. Newell's team finished as champions of the rebranded third-tier <a href="Football%20League%20One">Football League One</a> in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2004–05</a>.
While Newell's place was taken first by <a href="Kevin%20Blackwell">Kevin Blackwell</a> and later former player <a href="Mick%20Harford">Mick Harford</a>, the team was then relegated twice in a row, starting in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2006–07</a>, and spent the latter part of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a> in administration, thus incurring a ten-point deduction from that season's total. The club then had a total of 30 points docked from its <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2008–09</a> record by <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> and the Football League for financial irregularities dating back several years. These deductions proved to be too large an obstacle to overcome, but Luton came from behind in the final of the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> to win the competition for the first time.
From non-League to Premier League (2009–present).
Relegation meant that <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2009–10</a> saw Luton playing in the <a href="Conference%20Premier">Conference Premier</a>, a competition in which the club had never before participated. The club unsuccessfully contested the promotion play-offs three times in four seasons during their time as a non-League club, employing five different managers. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20FA%20Cup">2012–13 FA Cup</a> fourth round, Luton won their <a href="Norwich%20City%200%E2%80%931%20Luton%20Town%20%282013%29">away tie</a> against <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> club <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> 1–0 and, in doing so, became the first non-League team to beat a side from England's top division since 1989. In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2013–14 season</a>, under the management of <a href="John%20Still%20%28footballer%29">John Still</a>, Luton won the Conference Premier title with three games to spare, and thereby secured a return to the Football League from <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2014–15</a>. After reaching the <a href="EFL%20League%20Two%20play-offs">League Two play-offs</a> in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a>, when they were beaten 6–5 <a href="Aggregate%20score">on aggregate</a> by <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> in the semi-final, Luton were promoted back to <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">following season</a> as runners-up. Luton achieved a second successive promotion in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2018–19</a>, after they won the League One title, marking the club's return to the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> after a 12-year absence. Luton reached the <a href="2022%20English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">Championship play-offs</a> in <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2021–22</a>, where they were beaten 2–1 on aggregate by <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> in the semi-final. At the end of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2022–23</a> season, Luton Town secured a consecutive place in the Championship play-offs having finished in 3rd place. Luton Town beat <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> 3–2 on aggregate in the play-off semi-finals to reach the play-off final against <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>. They went on to beat Coventry City 6–5 on penalties after a tense 1–1 draw to secure promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> for the first time. After collecting only one point in their first five matches of the season, Luton won their first ever Premier League game on 30 September 2023, beating <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> 2–1 away at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a>.
Club identity.
The club's nickname, "the Hatters", reflects Luton's historical connection with the <a href="Hatmaking">hat making</a> trade, which has been prominent there since the 17th century. The nickname was originally a variant on the now rarely seen <a href="Straw%20plaiting">straw-plaiters</a>. Supporters of the club are also called Hatters.
The club is associated with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and orange, navy and white (first used in 1973, and worn by the team as of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 season</a>). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and black shorts were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white at the start of the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20in%20English%20football">1973–74 season</a>. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, when the team played in orange shirts and blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white shirts and black shorts; orange was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and orange palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll, but a year later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly orange strip with white shorts. Navy shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton wore orange shirts, navy shorts and white socks during the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 season</a>.
Luton Town have traditionally used the town's crest as its own in a manner similar to many other teams. The club's first badge was a white eight-pointed star, which was emblazoned across the team's shirts (then a deep <a href="cochineal">cochineal</a> red) in 1892. Four years later a crest comprising the club's initials intertwined was briefly adopted. The shirts were thereafter plain until 1933, when Luton first adopted a badge depicting a straw boater, which appeared on Luton shirts. The letters "LTFC" were added in 1935, and this basic design remained until 1947. The club then played without a badge until 1970, when the club began to wear the town crest regularly, having first done so in the 1959 FA Cup Final.
In 1973, concurrently with the club's switch to the orange kit, a new badge was introduced featuring the new colours. The new emblem depicted a stylised orange football, bearing the letters "Lt", surrounded by the club's name in navy blue text. In 1987, the club switched back to a derivative of the town emblem, with the shield portion of the heraldic crest becoming the team's badge; the only similarity with the previous design was the inclusion of the club name around the shield in navy blue. The "rainbow" badge, introduced in 1994, featured the town crest below an orange and blue bow which curved around to meet two footballs, positioned on either side of the shield, with the club name underneath. This badge was used until 2005, when a replacement very similar to the 1987 version was adopted, featuring black text rather than blue and a straw boater in place of the outstretched arm depicted in the older design. The club's founding year, 1885, was added in 2008. The badge was altered once more during the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2009–10</a> pre-season, with the red of the town crest being replaced with orange to better reflect the club colours.
The club released the song "Hatters, Hatters", a collaboration between the Luton team and the Bedfordshire-based musical comedy group <a href="the%20Barron%20Knights">the Barron Knights</a>, in 1974. Eight years later another song featuring vocals by the Luton players, "We're Luton Town", was released to celebrate the club's promotion to the First Division.
Shirt sponsors.
The first sponsor to appear on a Luton Town shirt was Tricentrol, a local motor company based in <a href="Dunstable">Dunstable</a>, who sponsored the club from March 1980 to 1982; the deal was worth £50,000.
A list of subsequent Luton Town shirt sponsors are as follow:
Stadium.
Luton Town's first ground was at <a href="Dallow%20Lane">Dallow Lane</a>, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground was next to the <a href="Dunstable%20Branch%20Lines">Dunstable to Luton railway line</a>, and players regularly claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1896–97</a> forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The <a href="Dunstable%20Road">Dunstable Road</a> ground was opened by <a href="Herbrand%20Russell%2C%2011th%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford</a>, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs. When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice, to its present <a href="Kenilworth%20Road">Kenilworth Road</a> site, in time for the start of the <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">1905–06 season</a>.
The stadium now has an all-seater capacity of 11,500 and is situated in the <a href="Bury%20Park">Bury Park</a> area of <a href="Luton">Luton</a>. It was named after the road that runs along one end of it, although the official address of the club is 1 Maple Road. Opposite the eponymous Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which has evolved from a stand first used exclusively by Luton supporters, then later by away supporters, and now used by both except in times of high ticket demand from away clubs. The Main Stand is flanked by the <a href="David%20Preece%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201963%29">David Preece</a> Stand, and opposite them stands a row of executive boxes. These boxes replaced the Bobbers Stand in 1986, as the club sought to maximise income.
The original Main Stand burnt down in 1921, and was replaced by the current stand before the <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20in%20English%20football">1922–23 season</a>. The ground underwent extensive redevelopment during the 1930s, and the capacity by the start of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> was 30,000. <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">Floodlights</a> were installed before the <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20in%20English%20football">1953–54 season</a>, but it was 20 years before any further modernisation was carried out. In 1973 the Bobbers Stand became all-seated, and in 1985 the grass pitch was replaced with an <a href="Artificial%20turf">artificial playing surface</a>; it quickly became unpopular and was derided as "the plastic pitch".
A <a href="1985%20Kenilworth%20Road%20riot">serious incident involving hooliganism</a> before, during and after a match against <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> in 1985 led to the club's then chairman, <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) <a href="David%20Evans%20%28British%20politician%29">David Evans</a>, introducing a scheme effective from the start of <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1986–87</a> supposedly banning all visiting supporters from the ground, and requiring home fans to carry membership cards when attending matches. Conversion to an all-seater ground also began in 1986. Away fans returned for <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1990–91</a>, and grass a year later. The David Preece Stand was erected in 1991, and the conversion of the Kenilworth Stand to an all-seater was completed in 2005.
New stadium.
The club first expressed an interest in building a new stadium away from Kenilworth Road in 1955, the year it won promotion to the First Division for the first time. Even then the ground was small compared to those of most First and Second Division clubs, and its location made significant redevelopment difficult. The team has since made several attempts to relocate. Leaving Luton for the nearby new town of <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> was unsuccessfully <a href="Relocation%20of%20Wimbledon%20F.C.%20to%20Milton%20Keynes%23Luton%20Town%E2%80%94%26quot%3BMK%20Hatters%26quot%3B%20%281980s%29">proposed</a> several times, most notably in the 1980s. The club sold Kenilworth Road to Luton Council in 1989, and has since leased it. A planning application for a new 20,000-seater indoor stadium, the "Kohlerdome" proposed by chairman <a href="David%20Kohler%20%28developer%29">David Kohler</a> in 1995, was turned down by the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Secretary of State</a> in 1998, and Kohler left soon after.
In 2007, the club's then-owners proposed a controversial plan to relocate to a site near Junction 12 of the <a href="M1%20motorway%20%28England%29">M1 motorway</a>, near <a href="Harlington%2C%20Bedfordshire">Harlington</a> and <a href="Toddington%2C%20Bedfordshire">Toddington</a>. A planning application was made on the club's behalf by former chairman Cliff Bassett, but the application was withdrawn almost immediately following the club's takeover in 2008. In 2009, the club began an independent feasibility study to determine a viable location to move to. The club did not rule out redeveloping Kenilworth Road and, in October 2012, entered talks to buy the stadium back from Luton Borough Council. By 2015, these plans had been dropped in favour of a move to a new location, with managing director Gary Sweet confirming that the club was in a position to "buy land, secure the best possible professional advice ... and to see the [planning] application process through to the receipt of consent."
In April 2016, the club announced its intention to build and move into a <a href="Power%20Court%20Stadium%20Project">17,500-capacity stadium on the Power Court site</a> in central Luton. Outline planning permission for this ground, with potential to expand to 23,000 seats, was granted by Luton Borough Council on 16 January 2019. In March 2021, the club announced that it intended to make a number of changes to the initial scheme to reflect changes caused by the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20England">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, but that the capacity of the new stadium was still to be 23,000 and had a target opening date of 2024. This plan was revised in 2023, to delivering the first phase, a 19,500-seat stadium, by 2026, followed by the second, a further 4,000 safe standing seats, at a later date.
Supporters and rivalries.
During the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a>, Luton Town had an average home league attendance of 8,702—the second highest in <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> behind only <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>. In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2013–14 season</a>, when the club were in the <a href="Conference%20Premier">Conference Premier</a>, the club had significantly higher support than the other clubs in its league, with an average home attendance of 7,387; more than twice compared to the second highest of 3,568. Average attendances at Kenilworth Road fell with the installation of seats and the club's reduction in stature, dropping from 13,452 in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1982–83</a> to their 2014–15 level—a slump of 35% over 32 years. A <a href="supporters%27%20trust">supporters' trust</a>, <a href="Trust%20in%20Luton">Trust in Luton</a>, owns shares in the club and elects a representative to the club's board. The club's official supporters' group, Luton Town Supporters' Club, merged with Trust in Luton in 2014. The club is associated with another supporters' group, the breakaway <a href="Loyal%20Luton%20Supporters%20Club">Loyal Luton Supporters Club</a>. Trust in Luton has, since March 2014, held the legal right to veto any changes to the club's identity, including name, nickname, colours, club crest and mascot.
Luton Town supporters maintain a bitter rivalry with <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>-based <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>. Watford were the higher ranked team at the end of every season from 1997 until 2022. However, overall Luton still hold the superior record in the fixture between the two clubs; out of 120 competitive matches there have been 55 Luton victories and 38 for Watford, with 29 draws. The 2003 <a href="Football%20Fans%20Census">Football Fans Census</a> showed that there was also animosity between Luton Town fans and those of west London club <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>.
The club produces an official match programme for home matches, entitled "Our Town". A character known as Happy Harry, a smiling man wearing a straw boater, serves as the team's mascot and appears on the Kenilworth Road pitch before matches. In December 2014, after the seafront <a href="statue%20of%20Eric%20Morecambe">statue of Eric Morecambe</a> in his birthplace <a href="Morecambe">Morecambe</a> was restored, Luton and <a href="Morecambe%20F.C.">Morecambe F.C.</a> jointly announced that the winners of future Luton–Morecambe fixtures would be awarded the "Eric Morecambe Trophy".

Sunderland A.F.C.

Sunderland Association Football Club (, ) is an English professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in the city of <a href="Sunderland">Sunderland</a>, <a href="Tyne%20and%20Wear">Tyne and Wear</a>. The team compete in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>, the second level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. 
Formed in 1879, the club has won six top-flight titles (1892, 1893, 1895, 1902, 1913, and 1936) in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, and has finished runners-up five times. The club has also won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> twice (1937 and 1973) and been runners-up twice (1913 and 1992), as well as winning the <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a> in 1936 and being finalists the following year. Sunderland have also been <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> finalists in 1985 and 2014.
Nicknamed the "Black Cats", Sunderland play their home games at the 49,000-capacity <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater</a> <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a> having moved from <a href="Roker%20Park">Roker Park</a> in 1997. The original ground capacity was 42,000 which was increased to 49,000 following expansion in 2000. The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, with whom the <a href="Tyne%E2%80%93Wear%20derby">Tyne–Wear derby</a> has been contested since 1898. The club has played in red and white-striped shirts and black shorts for nearly the entirety of its history.
History.
Early years and the "Team of All Talents" (1879–1908).
The club was founded as Sunderland and District Teachers A.F.C. by <a href="schoolmaster">schoolmaster</a> <a href="James%20Allan%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201857%29">James Allan</a> in what has commonly been believed to be October 1879. However, evidence suggests that the club was not formally created until a year later, on 25 September 1880. It was renamed as Sunderland A.F.C. and became open to more than just school teachers in October 1880.
Sunderland joined <a href="English%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> for the <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season">1890–91 season</a>. <a href="Tom%20Watson%20%28football%20manager%29">Tom Watson</a> became Sunderland's first manager when he was appointed in 1888. During the late 19th century, they were declared the "Team of All Talents" by <a href="William%20McGregor%20%28football%29">William McGregor</a>, the founder of the league, after a 7–2 win against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. Sunderland won the league championship in the <a href="1891%E2%80%9392%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season">1891–92 season</a>, one season after joining The Football League, and this performance led "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" to describe the players as "a wonderfully fine team". Sunderland successfully defended the title the following season, aided by their Scottish <a href="forward%20%28association%20football%29">centre forward</a> <a href="John%20Campbell%20%28footballer%20born%201870%29">John Campbell</a>, who broke the 30-goal mark for the second time in consecutive seasons. In the process, they became the first team to score 100 goals in a season, a feat not matched until <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20</a>.
Sunderland came close to winning a third successive league championship in the <a href="1893%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1893–94 season</a>, finishing second behind Aston Villa. However, they regained the title in the <a href="1894%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1894–95 season</a>, with Campbell becoming league top scorer for the third time. Sunderland then beat Scottish champions <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Heart of Midlothian</a> in a game described as the "<a href="1895%20World%20Championship%20%28football%29">World Championship</a>" match. Their goalkeeper <a href="Ned%20Doig">Ned Doig</a> set a 19th-century world record by not conceding any goals in 87 of his 290 top division appearances (30%). From 1886 until 1898, Sunderland's home ground was in <a href="Newcastle%20Road">Newcastle Road</a>. In 1898, the club moved to what would become their home for almost a century, <a href="Roker%20Park">Roker Park</a>. Initially the ground had a capacity of 30,000.
After taking Sunderland to three English League championship titles manager Watson resigned at the end of the 1895–96 season, in order to join <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. <a href="Robert%20Campbell%20%28football%20manager%29">Robert Campbell</a> replaced him. Campbell did not achieve the same playing success as Watson, as Sunderland failed to win any titles in his three seasons at the club.
Scotsman <a href="Alex%20Mackie">Alex Mackie</a> replaced Campbell as manager for the 1899 season. Following a second-place finish in 1900–01, the club won their fourth league title in the <a href="1901%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">1901–02 season</a>, and followed this up with victory in the <a href="Sheriff%20of%20London%20Charity%20Shield">Sheriff of London Charity Shield</a>.
In December 1902, <a href="Arthur%20Bridgett">Arthur Bridgett</a> joined Sunderland. He went on to captain the "Black Cats" for ten years and gain eleven England caps, making him the club's second most-capped England international behind <a href="David%20Watson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201946%29">Dave Watson</a>.
Further league championship titles (1908–1945).
On 5 December 1908, Sunderland achieved their highest ever league win, 9–1 against north-east rivals Newcastle United. Under Irish manager <a href="Bob%20Kyle">Bob Kyle</a> and with Scottish <a href="Charles%20Thomson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201878%29">Charles Thomson</a> as captain, the club won the league again in 1913, but lost their first <a href="FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> 1–0 to Aston Villa.
Two seasons later the First World War brought the league to a halt. After the league's resumption, Sunderland came close to winning another championship in the <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20in%20English%20football">1922–23 season</a>, when they were runners-up to Liverpool. They also came close the following season, finishing third. The club escaped relegation from the First Division by one point in the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20in%20English%20football">1927–28 season</a> despite 35 goals from <a href="Dave%20Halliday">Dave Halliday</a>. 
Halliday improved his goal scoring to 43 goals in 42 games the following season, an all-time Sunderland record for goals scored in a single season.
The club's sixth league championship came in the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20in%20English%20football">1935–36</a> season under Scottish manager <a href="Johnny%20Cochrane">Johnny Cochrane</a>. They scored 109 goals during the season, with <a href="Raich%20Carter">Raich Carter</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Gurney">Bobby Gurney</a> each scoring 31. They followed this by winning the Charity Shield against FA Cup winners Arsenal.
Despite winning the league, the season did not go without tragedy. The young goalkeeper of the team, <a href="Jimmy%20Thorpe">Jimmy Thorpe</a>, died as a result of being kicked after he had picked up the ball following a <a href="backpass">backpass</a> against <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. He continued to take part until the match finished, but collapsed at home and died in hospital four days later. This incident led to a change in the rules, whereby players were no longer allowed to raise their foot to a goalkeeper when he had control of the ball in his arms.
They won the FA Cup the following season, after a 3–1 victory against Preston North End at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. Some football was still played during the Second World War as a morale boosting exercise, in the form of the <a href="Football%20League%20War%20Cup">Football League War Cup</a>. Sunderland were finalists in the tournament in <a href="1942%20Football%20League%20War%20Cup%20Final">1942</a>.
"The Bank of England" club, financial troubles and three cup finals (1945–1995).
For Sunderland, the immediate post-war years were characterised by significant spending; the club paid £18,000 (£ today) for <a href="Carlisle%20United%20F.C.">Carlisle United</a>'s <a href="Ivor%20Broadis">Ivor Broadis</a> in January 1949. Broadis was also Carlisle's manager at the time, and this is the first instance of a player transferring himself to another club. This, along with record-breaking transfer fees to secure the services of <a href="Len%20Shackleton">Len Shackleton</a> and the Welsh international <a href="Trevor%20Ford">Trevor Ford</a>, led to a contemporary nickname, the "<a href="Bank%20of%20England%20club">Bank of England club</a>". The club finished third in the First Division in <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20in%20English%20football">1950</a>, their highest finish since the 1936 championship.
The late 1950s saw a sharp downturn in Sunderland's fortunes, and the club was once again implicated in a major financial scandal in 1957. Found guilty of making payments to players in excess of the <a href="Salary%20cap">maximum wage</a>, they were fined £5,000 (£ today), and their chairman and three directors were suspended. The following year, Sunderland were <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> from the highest division for the first time in their 68-year league history.
Sunderland's absence from the top flight lasted six years. After a close call in the previous season, the club was promoted to Division One in 1964 after finishing in second place. At the end of the decade, they were again relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st.
Sunderland won their last major trophy in 1973, in a 1–0 victory over <a href="Don%20Revie">Don Revie</a>'s <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a> in the FA Cup Final. A <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> club at the time, Sunderland won the game thanks mostly to the efforts of their goalkeeper <a href="Jimmy%20Montgomery">Jimmy Montgomery</a>. <a href="Ian%20Porterfield">Ian Porterfield</a> scored a <a href="volley%20%28football%29">volley</a> in the 30th minute to beat Leeds and take the trophy. Since 1973 only two other clubs, <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> in 1976, and <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in 1980, have equalled Sunderland's achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football.
By winning the FA Cup, Sunderland qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>, the club's only appearance in European competition to date. They beat <a href="Vasas%20SC">Vasas Budapest</a> but then lost on aggregate to <a href="Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal">Sporting</a> of Portugal in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%201973%E2%80%9374%23Second%20round">second round</a>. After spending six seasons in the Second Division, Sunderland were promoted to Division One in the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football">1975–76 season</a>, but were relegated again the following season, despite a late-season comeback which saw them win two matches 6–0 and 6–1.
Sunderland appeared in their first <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> final in <a href="1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1985</a>, but lost 1–0 to <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>. In 1987, Sunderland saw one of the lowest points in their history, when they were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> of the English league for the first time. Under new chairman <a href="Bob%20Murray%20%28businessman%29">Bob Murray</a> and new manager <a href="Denis%20Smith%20%28football%20manager%29">Denis Smith</a>, the club was promoted the following season. In 1990, they were promoted back to the top flight in unusual circumstances, losing to <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a> in the play-off final, but Swindon's promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of financial irregularities and Sunderland were promoted instead. They stayed up for one year before being relegated on the final day of the following season.
Sunderland's next outing in a major final came in <a href="1992%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1992</a> when, as a Second Division club, they returned to the FA Cup final. There was to be no repeat of the heroics of 1973, as Sunderland lost 2–0 to Liverpool.
New stadium, promotions and relegations (1995–2006).
In 1995, they faced the prospect of a return to the third-tier of English football. <a href="Peter%20Reid">Peter Reid</a> was brought in as manager, and quickly turned things around. Reid's time in charge had a stabilising effect; he remained manager for seven years. After promotion from Division One in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96 season</a>, Sunderland began their first season in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, but finished third from the bottom and were relegated back to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>.
In 1997, Sunderland left <a href="Roker%20Park">Roker Park</a> and moved to the <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a>, a 42,000-seat arena that, at the time, was the largest stadium built in <a href="England">England</a> after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The capacity was later increased to 49,000.
Sunderland returned to the Premier League as First Division champions in 1999 with a then-record 105 points. At the end of the season Sunderland finished seventh, with <a href="Kevin%20Phillips%20%28footballer%29">Kevin Phillips</a> winning the <a href="European%20Golden%20Shoe">European Golden Shoe</a> in his first top-flight season, scoring 30 goals.
Another seventh-place finish in the 2000–01 season was followed by two less successful seasons, and they were relegated to the second-tier with a then-record low 19 points in 2003. Former <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Ireland</a> manager <a href="Mick%20McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> took over at the club, and, in 2005, he took Sunderland up as champions for the third time in less than 10 years. However, the club's stay in the top flight was short-lived as Sunderland were once again relegated, this time with a new record-low total of 15 points. McCarthy left the club in mid-season, and he was replaced temporarily by former Sunderland player <a href="Kevin%20Ball">Kevin Ball</a>.
Drumaville Consortium takeover and Ellis Short era (2006–2016).
Following Sunderland's relegation from the Premier League, the club was taken over by the Irish <a href="Drumaville%20Consortium">Drumaville Consortium</a>, headed by ex-player <a href="Niall%20Quinn">Niall Quinn</a>, who appointed former <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> captain <a href="Roy%20Keane">Roy Keane</a> as the new manager. Under Keane, the club rose steadily up the table with an unbeaten run of 17 games to win promotion to the Premier League, Following an inconsistent start to the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09 season</a>, Keane resigned. Before the start of the following campaign, Irish-American businessman <a href="Ellis%20Short">Ellis Short</a> completed a full takeover of the club, and <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> was announced as the next manager on 3 June.
One of Bruce's first signings, <a href="Darren%20Bent">Darren Bent</a>, cost a club record fee of £10 million, broken a year later when they bought Ghana international <a href="Asamoah%20Gyan">Asamoah Gyan</a> for around £13 million. Sunderland started the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football">2010–11</a> season strongly, but after Bent left for Aston Villa in January 2011 in a deal potentially worth £24 million, a record transfer fee received for the club, they eventually finished 10th—which was still their highest top-flight finish for 10 years. After being named Sunderland's Young Player of the Year for two seasons in a row, local player <a href="Jordan%20Henderson">Jordan Henderson</a> was transferred to Liverpool at the end of the 2010–11 season, where he went on to win the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> among other achievements.
Short replaced Quinn as chairman in October 2011, with Quinn initially becoming Director of International Development; he left the club with immediate effect in February 2012. Bruce was sacked in November 2011, and replaced by <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a>. O'Neill was sacked in March 2013 and Italian <a href="Paolo%20Di%20Canio">Paolo Di Canio</a> was announced as his replacement the following day to widespread controversy. Sunderland went on to avoid relegation with one game to go. Di Canio was sacked after a poor start to the 2013–14 season, and reports of a complete breakdown in relations with his players. <a href="Gus%20Poyet">Gus Poyet</a> was announced as his replacement, and led Sunderland to the <a href="2014%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2014 Football League Cup Final</a>, where they were defeated 3–1 by <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. In March 2015 Poyet was sacked, and veteran Dutchman <a href="Dick%20Advocaat">Dick Advocaat</a> was appointed, saving the club from relegation. Eight games into the 2015–16 season he resigned from the position. <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> was appointed the next manager in October 2015, and the club was again saved from relegation at the end of the season.
Divisional movements and ownership changes (2016–present).
In July 2016, Allardyce left the club to be announced as manager for the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a>, and <a href="David%20Moyes">David Moyes</a> was appointed as his replacement. Under Moyes, Sunderland made the worst ever start to a Premier League season, taking just two points from their opening 10 matches. The club was relegated for the first time in 10 years at the end of 2016–17, finishing bottom of the table, and Moyes resigned. In June 2017, goalkeeper <a href="Jordan%20Pickford">Jordan Pickford</a>, a product of Sunderland's academy, was transferred to Everton for a fee of £25 million, rising to a possible £30 million—a record for a British goalkeeper.
Following relegation, <a href="Simon%20Grayson">Simon Grayson</a> was announced as the new manager. The club made a very poor start to the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20EFL%20Championship">2017–18 EFL Championship</a> season (which was documented in the <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> series "<a href="Sunderland%20%27Til%20I%20Die">Sunderland 'Til I Die</a>") and Grayson was sacked at the end of October, with <a href="Chris%20Coleman%20%28footballer%29">Chris Coleman</a> replacing him. In April 2018, after a second consecutive relegation, this time to <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a>, the club was sold to a group led by <a href="Stewart%20Donald">Stewart Donald</a> and Coleman was released from his contract.
<a href="Jack%20Ross%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201976%29">Jack Ross</a> was appointed as the new manager in May 2018. In the club's first season in League One they got to the final of the <a href="2019%20EFL%20Trophy%20Final">EFL Trophy</a> and finished 5th and reached the play-off final, but lost to <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> at Wembley. After a disappointing start to the following 2019–20 season, Ross was sacked. He was replaced by former <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> manager <a href="Phil%20Parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a>. Sunderland finished the season in 8th place, their lowest ever league position, with the final standings ultimately being determined by points per game due to football's suspension due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>.
Parkinson was sacked in November 2020 and was replaced by <a href="Lee%20Johnson%20%28footballer%29">Lee Johnson</a> the following month. Later that month, the club reached an agreement with <a href="Kyril%20Louis-Dreyfus">Kyril Louis-Dreyfus</a> for him to purchase a controlling stake in the club. The takeover was completed on 18 February 2021. In May 2021, the club again fell short of promotion after losing to <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a> 3–2 on aggregate in the semifinals of the play-offs.
In February 2022, former <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich</a> manager <a href="Alex%20Neil%20%28footballer%29">Alex Neil</a> was appointed as head coach, following Johnson's dismissal after a 6–0 loss to Bolton in January. After finishing fifth in <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> at the end of the season, Sunderland qualified for the playoffs. In the semi-finals, they beat <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday">Sheffield Wednesday</a> 2–1 on aggregate, and went on to beat <a href="Wycombe%20Wanderers">Wycombe Wanderers</a> 2–0 in the final to secure a return to the second flight of English football for the first time in four years. <a href="Tony%20Mowbray">Tony Mowbray</a> took over as head coach in August that year following Neil's departure to manage Stoke City. Sunderland ended the season in 6th, and were knocked out of the playoff semi-final by <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>. On 4 December 2023, Mowbray and his assistant <a href="Mark%20Venus">Mark Venus</a> were sacked. On , <a href="Michael%20Beale%20%28football%20coach%29">Michael Beale</a> was appointed as head coach on a contract until the Summer of 2026.
Colours and crest.
Sunderland played in an all blue <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">strip</a> from their formation until 1884, when they adopted a red and white halved strip. They assumed the current strip of red and white stripes in the <a href="1887%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football">1887–88 season</a>. Their badge included a ship, the upper part of the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Sunderland">Sunderland coat of arms</a>, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland's red and white stripes. In 1972 the badge was changed, removing the black cat but still including a ship, a football and the background of red and white stripes. This badge was first used on the match day shirt in 1977, replacing the simple black 'SAFC' initials which had been used since 1973. The top section and border of the badge was coloured in blue until 1991, when it changed to black.
To coincide with the move from Roker Park to the Stadium of Light in 1997, Sunderland released a new crest divided into four quarters; the upper right and lower left featured their traditional red and white colours, but the ship was omitted. The upper left section features the <a href="Penshaw%20Monument">Penshaw Monument</a> and the lower right section shows the <a href="Wearmouth%20Bridge">Wearmouth Bridge</a>. A colliery wheel at the top of the crest commemorates County Durham's mining history, and the land the Stadium of Light was built on, formerly the <a href="Monkwearmouth%20Colliery">Monkwearmouth Colliery</a>. The crest also contains two lions, the black cats of Sunderland, and a banner displaying the club's motto, "Consectatio Excellentiae", which means "In pursuit of excellence".
Stadium.
Sunderland have had eight grounds throughout their history; the first was at <a href="Blue%20House%20Field">Blue House Field</a> in <a href="Hendon%2C%20Sunderland">Hendon</a> in 1879. The ground was close to the place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent for use of the ground was £10 (£ today). The club then used a number of fields, one of which was near The Cedars road, before relocating to <a href="Groves%20Field">Groves Field</a> in <a href="Ashbrooke">Ashbrooke</a> in 1882 for one season. The club's third stadium was <a href="Horatio%20Street">Horatio Street</a> in <a href="Roker">Roker</a>, the first Sunderland stadium north of the <a href="River%20Wear">River Wear</a>; the club played a single season there before another move, this time to <a href="Abbs%20Field">Abbs Field</a> in <a href="Fulwell%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Fulwell</a> for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.
Sunderland moved to <a href="Newcastle%20Road%20%28stadium%29">Newcastle Road</a> in 1886. By 1898, the ground reached a capacity of 15,000 after renovations, and its rent had risen to £100 (£ today) a year. Near the turn of the 20th century, Sunderland needed a bigger stadium. They returned to Roker and set up home in <a href="Roker%20Park">Roker Park</a>. It was opened on 10 September 1898, and the home team played a match the same day against Liverpool, which they won. The stadium's capacity increased to 50,000 after redevelopment with architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> in 1913. Sunderland were nearly bankrupted by the cost of renovating the Main Stand, and Roker Park was put up for sale but no further action was taken. On 8 March 1933, an overcrowded Roker Park recorded the highest ever attendance at a Sunderland match, 75,118 against <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> in a FA Cup sixth round replay. Roker Park suffered a bombing in 1943, in which one corner of the stadium was destroyed. A <a href="special%20constable">special constable</a> was killed while patrolling the stadium. By the 1990s, the stadium was no longer large enough, and had no room for possible expansion. In January 1990, the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> was released after <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">overcrowding</a> at <a href="Hillsborough%20Stadium">Hillsborough Stadium</a> resulted in the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans. The report recommended that all major stadiums must be converted to an all-seater design. As a result, Roker Park's capacity was reduced. It was demolished in 1997 and a housing estate built in its place.
In 1997, Sunderland moved to their present ground, <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a> in <a href="Monkwearmouth">Monkwearmouth</a>, which was opened by <a href="Prince%20Andrew%2C%20Duke%20of%20York">Prince Andrew, Duke of York</a>. Built with an original capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>. The stadium bears a similar name to the Portuguese club <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>'s ground <a href="Est%C3%A1dio%20da%20Luz">Estádio da Luz</a>, albeit in a different language. A stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A <a href="Davy%20lamp">Davy lamp</a> monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner was presented to the club by the <a href="Durham%20Miners%27%20Association">Durham Miners' Association</a>, as a reminder of the <a href="Monkwearmouth%20Colliery">Monkwearmouth Colliery</a> pit the stadium was built on.
Supporters and rivalries.
Attendance and following.
The club has had a historically large and passionate following, with the club seeing attendance figures larger than other more fashionable clubs. For instance a 2019 by the International Centre for Sports Studies (<a href="CIES">CIES</a>) showed that over the prior 5 seasons (2013 to 2018) Sunderland recorded the 38th highest average attendance in world football with an average of 39,249 fans at the <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a>. Sunderland's average attendance were higher over that period than perennial title challengers such as <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus F.C.</a> in Italy and <a href="FC%20Porto">FC Porto</a> in Portugal. Despite relegation from the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 2017 the club has continued to post large annual average attendance figures, recording over 30,000 for the 2019 and 2020 seasons, enough for 16th in the country. Following relegation from <a href="the%20Championship">the Championship</a> at the end of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a>, Sunderland subsequently broke the <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> division attendance record on 26 December 2018 in a match against <a href="Bradford%20City">Bradford City</a> with a total of 46,039 fans.
Popular songs, music and chants.
A song Sunderland fans sing every game before kickoff and has been described as the anthem of the club is a rendition of "<a href="Can%27t%20Help%20Falling%20in%20Love">Can't Help Falling in Love</a>" by <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, with "Sunderland" being sung repeatedly after "but I can't help falling in love with you." "Dance of the Knights" from <a href="Sergei%20Prokofiev">Sergei Prokofiev</a>'s ballet "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet%20%28Prokofiev%29">Romeo and Juliet</a>" is traditionally played before the teams take the field; the club's walk-on song is "Ready to Go" by <a href="Republica">Republica</a>, with the crowd typically singing its chorus. Also, during Gus Poyet's tenure, Sunderland supporters started singing "" by <a href="D%20Ream">D:Ream</a>. The fans launched a campaign to get the song back into the charts, to coincide with their team's 2014 League Cup Final. A day after the Final, the song re-entered the <a href="UK%20Dance%20Singles%20and%20Albums%20Charts">UK Dance Chart</a> at number 19.
Two of the most famous <a href="Football%20chant">chants</a> by Sunderland supporters are "I'm Sunderland till I die" and "We're by far the greatest team, the world has ever seen"—with the former being chosen as the title of the Netflix show "Sunderland 'Til I Die". One of the oldest Sunderland chants is "Ha'way the lads" which was sung at Sunderland games as far back as the 1960s.
According to a <a href="YouGov">YouGov</a> poll in 2014, supporters of Sunderland showed a tendency towards <a href="left-wing">left</a> politics. They sometimes sing a version of "<a href="The%20Red%20Flag">The Red Flag</a>" during games.
Ain't No Stopping Us Now, was SAFC's official release when the club reached the 1992 FA Cup Final against Liverpool. The song featured the first team squad and was released on A Love Supreme Records. 
Cheer Up Peter Reid was released by fans in 1996 after the terrace chant about the manager became popular. It sold 40,000 copies and peaked at 41 in the UK charts, and was number one in the NME Indie Charts. The proceeds of Cheer Up Peter Reid were donated to cancer charities. Another chant became a recording when A Love Supreme released Niall Quinn's Disco Pants in 1999. It reached number one in the NME Indie Charts.
Fanzines and fan produced material.
The <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a> "<a href="A%20Love%20Supreme%20%28Sunderland%29">A Love Supreme</a>" was first published in 1989 and has won nine awards for Fanzine of the Year. A Love Supreme has its base opposite the <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a>, where its staff design the magazine, update their website, social media and create and sell their own range of fan related merchandise and provide coach travel for SAFC fans to every away game. Since 2010 the online fanzine "<a href="Roker%20Report">Roker Report</a>" has operated on the <a href="SB%20Nation">SB Nation</a> blogging network. Roker Report has since grown in popularity amongst Sunderland fans, producing daily articles and interaction with fans. In 2016 Roker Report started a podcast called RokerRapport which has three or four episodes weekly. They occasionally interview current and former footballers, managers, owners and prominent fans of Sunderland. Since 2013 an independent podcast called Wise Men Say was created and was initially one episode weekly; however, it has since grown in popularity and now does three episodes weekly. In 2021 we began publishing opinion pieces on wisemensay.co.uk with a team of writers producing a wide range of features and informative articles. And, in 2021, the Wise Men Say Podcast was nominated Club Podcast of the Year at the 2021 Football Supporters Association Awards. In 2022, Wise Men Say reached 2million downloads through its host platform Acast. The club also previously had an official monthly subscription magazine, called the "Legion of Light", which season ticket holders received for no cost. Others in the past have been "It's The Hope I Can't Stand", "Sex and Chocolate", "Wise Men Say", and "The Roker Roar" (later "The Wearside Roar").
Supporters clubs and officially recognised organisations.
According to the club there are over 70 branches of official Supporters' Clubs in England and around the world, including North Korea. The Official clubs are represented collectively by a Branch Liaison Council that was formed in the 1970s. In addition the club has had a SAFC Liaison Group (SLG) since 1994 that works with fans on club issues and an independent supporters group, the Red & White Army (RAWA).
Rivalries and close ties.
Traditionally, Sunderland's two main rivals have been <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> and <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>, against whom the <a href="Tyne%E2%80%93Wear%20derby">Tyne–Wear derby</a> and <a href="Tees%E2%80%93Wear%20derby">Tees–Wear derby</a> are competed for respectively. Although both are generally geographically close, Newcastle are considered their main rivals. The club were rivals with fellow Sunderland-based team <a href="Sunderland%20Albion">Sunderland Albion</a> in the 1880s and 1890s, a breakaway club formed by Sunderland's founder James Allan, until the club was made defunct. A more recent rivalry is with <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>, sparked by a <a href="Coventry%20City%202-2%20Bristol%20City%20%281977%29">controversial match in 1977</a> which, combined with results elsewhere, relegated Sunderland from the First Division but kept Coventry up.
Sunderland also share good relations and a mutual friendship with Dutch club <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a>; this was developed after Wearside shipbuilders found jobs in Rotterdam during the 1970s and 80s. The club also has good relations and a mutual friendship with <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>, with matches between the two clubs being known as the "<a href="Friendship%20Trophy">Friendship Trophy</a>," following good rapport in the <a href="1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1985 Milk Cup final</a>.

In popular culture.
Sunderland were the subject, together with <a href="Aston%20Villa%20FC">Aston Villa</a>, of one of the earliest football paintings in the world when in 1895 the artist Thomas M. M. Hemy painted a picture of a game between the teams at Sunderland's then ground <a href="Newcastle%20Road">Newcastle Road</a>.
In 1973, comedian <a href="Bobby%20Knoxall">Bobby Knoxall</a> recorded "Sunderland All the Way" for the <a href="1973%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1973 FA Cup Final</a> record.
In 1996, a group of Sunderland fans under the name Simply Red and White released a song called "Daydream Believer (Cheer Up Peter Reid)" to the melody of "<a href="Daydream%20Believer">Daydream Believer</a>" dedicated to the manager <a href="Peter%20Reid">Peter Reid</a>. The song peaked at number 41 in the UK Singles & Album Chart. The fans recorded the song due to the fact the manager often had a dour demeanour, whilst the team was doing well, and even won promotion at the end of the season.
Sunderland were mentioned in the May 1997 <a href="State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a> when <a href="Chris%20Mullin%20%28politician%29">Chris Mullin</a>, <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">MP</a> for <a href="Sunderland%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Sunderland South</a>, stated in his seconding of <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>'s Gracious Speech:
Sunderland has been through hard times in the past, and has survived; as before, we will pick ourselves up, dust ourselves down and come out fighting. Sunderland looks to the future, not the past, and we shall soon be back in the Premier League.
In 1998 and following the demolition of Roker Park, playwright Tom Kelly and actor Paul Dunn created a one-man play called "I Left My Heart at Roker Park" about a fan struggling with the move and what Roker Park meant for him – the play originally ran in 1997, and has had a few revivals since.
In 1998, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> broadcast a six-part documentary named "<a href="Premier%20Passions">Premier Passions</a>". It chronicled Sunderland's <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1996–97 season</a>, in which the club was <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> from the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the year after winning <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> from the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Football League First Division</a>, and the move to <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">Stadium of Light</a>.
In 2018, Netflix released an eight-part documentary called <a href="Sunderland%20%27Til%20I%20Die">Sunderland 'Til I Die</a>. It documented the events around Sunderland's <a href="2017-18%20Sunderland%20A.F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a> which saw them relegated from the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>. As a result of the success of the first series, a second season was confirmed, despite opposition from many club members. The opposition was mostly to do with players fearing the series would cause their failures being associated with them for the rest of their careers.
Nicknames.
Sunderland's official nickname is "The Black Cats". The name was made official in a public vote in 2000. Despite the nickname being made official only relatively recently, the black cat has been used as an emblem of the club throughout most of its history. Photographs exist of players holding a black cat which made Roker Park its home in the 1900s and 1910s, and which was fed and watered by the football club. The club's first official badge featured a black cat sitting prominently in its centre and since the 1960s the emblem of the Sunderland A.F.C. Supporters Association has been a black cat. A Sunderland supporter, Billy Morris, took a black cat in his chest pocket as a good luck charm to the 1937 FA Cup final in which Sunderland brought home the trophy for the first time and reference has also been made to a "Black Cat Battery", an <a href="Artillery%20battery">Artillery battery</a> based on the <a href="River%20Wear">River Wear</a> during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>.
Before this when the team still played at Roker Park, they were known as the Rokerites. This was made obsolete after the club left Roker Park for the Stadium of Light in 1997. Other nicknames used by the media and include the <a href="Mackems">Mackems</a> (believed to be related to the ship building industry and a name for inhabitants of Sunderland) or the Wearsiders, as a reference to the river that the city and broader region of <a href="Wearside">Wearside</a> sits alongside, and in contrast to their <a href="Tyneside">Tyneside</a> rivals Newcastle United.
As well as club nicknames, names have been used to define memorable periods in the club's history. The "Team of All Talents" moniker was used during Sunderland's successful period in the 1890s, and Sunderland were known as the "<a href="Bank%20of%20England%20club">Bank of England club</a>" during the 1950s. This was in reference to the club's spending in the <a href="transfer%20market">transfer market</a> at the time, which saw the transfer-record broken twice.

In October 2015, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United for the sixth consecutive time, a new record.
Sunderland's record home attendance is 75,200, set during a sixth round FA Cup replay against Derby County on 8 March 1933.

Birmingham City F.C.

Birmingham City Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, England. Formed in 1875 as Small Heath Alliance, it was renamed Small Heath in 1888, Birmingham in 1905, and Birmingham City in 1943. Since 2011, the first team have competed in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>, the second tier of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a>.
As Small Heath, they played in the <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a> before becoming founder members and first champions of the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a>. The most successful period in their history was in the 1950s and early 1960s. They achieved their highest finishing position of sixth in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20Football%20League">1955–56 season</a> and reached the <a href="1956%20FA%20Cup%20final">1956 FA Cup final</a>. Birmingham played in two <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> finals, in <a href="1960%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup%20Final">1960</a>, as the first English club side to reach a major European final, and again the <a href="1961%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup%20final">following year</a>. They won the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> in <a href="1963%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1963</a> and again in <a href="2011%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2011</a>. Birmingham have played in the top tier of English football for around half of their history: the longest period spent outside the top division, between 1986 and 2002, included two brief spells in the third tier of English football, during which time they won the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> twice.
<a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20%28stadium%29">St Andrew's</a> has been their home ground since 1906. They have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, their nearest neighbours, with whom they play the <a href="Second%20City%20derby">Second City derby</a>. The club's nickname is Blues, after the colour of their <a href="kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a>, and the fans are known as Bluenoses.
History.
The early years (1875–1943).
Birmingham City were founded as Small Heath Alliance in 1875, and from 1877 played their home games at <a href="Muntz%20Street">Muntz Street</a>. The club turned professional in 1885, and three years later became the first football club to become a <a href="private%20company%20limited%20by%20shares">limited company</a> with a board of directors, under the name of Small Heath F.C. Ltd. From the <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1889–90 season</a> they played in the <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a>, which ran alongside the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a>. In 1892, Small Heath, along with the other Alliance teams, were invited to join the newly formed <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a>. They finished as champions, but failed to win <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> via the <a href="Football%20League%20test%20matches">test match</a> system; the following season promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> was secured after a second-place finish and test match victory over <a href="Darwen%20F.C.%20%281870%29">Darwen</a>. The club adopted the name Birmingham Football Club in 1905, and moved into their new home, <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20%28stadium%29">St Andrew's Ground</a>, the following year. Matters on the field failed to live up to their surroundings. Birmingham were relegated in 1908, obliged to apply for <a href="re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-election</a> two years later, and remained in the Second Division until after the First World War.
<a href="Frank%20Womack">Frank Womack</a>'s <a href="captain%20%28association%20football%29">captaincy</a> and the creativity of <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scottish international</a> <a href="playmaker">playmaker</a> <a href="Johnny%20Crosbie">Johnny Crosbie</a> contributed much to Birmingham winning their second Division Two title in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20Football%20League">1920–21</a>. Womack went on to make 515 appearances, a club record for an <a href="outfield">outfield</a>er, over a twenty-year career. 1920 also saw the debut of the 19-year-old <a href="Joe%20Bradford">Joe Bradford</a>, who went on to score a club record 267 goals in 445 games, and won 12 <a href="cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a> for <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>. In 1931, manager <a href="Leslie%20Knighton">Leslie Knighton</a> led the club to their first <a href="1931%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a>, which they lost 2–1 to Second Division club <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion">West Bromwich Albion</a>. Though Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons, they struggled in the league, with much reliance placed on England goalkeeper <a href="Harry%20Hibbs%20%28footballer%29">Harry Hibbs</a> to make up for the lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end. They were finally relegated in 1939, the last full season before the Football League was abandoned for the duration of the Second World War.
Birmingham City: Post-war success (1943–1965).
The name Birmingham City F.C. was adopted in 1943. Under <a href="Harry%20Storer%20Jr.">Harry Storer</a>, appointed manager in 1945, the club won the <a href="Football%20League%20North%20and%20South">Football League South</a> wartime league and reached the semi-final of the first post-war <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. Two years later they won their third Second Division title, conceding only 24 goals in the 42-game season. Storer's successor, <a href="Bob%20Brocklebank">Bob Brocklebank</a>, though unable to stave off relegation in 1950, brought in players who made a major contribution to the club's successes of the next decade. When <a href="Arthur%20Turner%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201909%29">Arthur Turner</a> took over as manager in November 1954, he made them play closer to their potential, and a 5–1 win on the last day of the 1954–55 season confirmed them as champions. In their first season back in the First Division, Birmingham achieved their highest league finish of sixth place. They also reached the <a href="1956%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a>, losing 3–1 to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in the game notable for City's goalkeeper <a href="Bert%20Trautmann">Bert Trautmann</a> playing the last 20 minutes with a broken bone in his neck. The following season the club lost in the FA Cup semi-final for the third time since the war, this time beaten 2–0 by <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a>'s "<a href="Busby%20Babes">Busby Babes</a>".
Birmingham became the first English club side to take part in European competition when they played their first group game in the inaugural <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> competition on 15 May 1956; they went on to reach the semi-final, in which they drew 4–4 on aggregate with <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> but lost the replay 2–1. They were also the first English club side to reach a European final, losing 4–1 <a href="two-legged%20match">on aggregate</a> to Barcelona in the 1960 Fairs Cup final and 4–2 to <a href="A.S.%20Roma">A.S. Roma</a> the following year. In the 1961 semi-final they beat <a href="Inter%20Milan">Internazionale</a> home and away; no other English club won a competitive game in the <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a> until <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> managed it in 2003. <a href="Gil%20Merrick">Gil Merrick</a>'s side saved their best form for cup competitions. Though opponents in the <a href="1963%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1963 League Cup final</a>, local rivals <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, were pre-match favourites, Birmingham raised their game and won 3–1 on aggregate to lift their first major trophy. In 1965, after ten years in the top flight, they returned to the Second Division.
Investment, promotion and decline (1965–1993).
Businessman Clifford Coombs took over as chairman in 1965, luring <a href="Stan%20Cullis">Stan Cullis</a> out of retirement to manage the club. Cullis's team played attractive football which took them to the semi-finals of the League Cup in 1967 and of the FA Cup in 1968, but league football needed a different approach. Successor <a href="Freddie%20Goodwin">Freddie Goodwin</a> produced a team playing skilful, aggressive football that won promotion as well as reaching an FA Cup semi-final. Two years later, the club raised money by selling <a href="Bob%20Latchford">Bob Latchford</a> to <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> for a British record fee of £350,000, but without his goals the team struggled. Sir <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> briefly managed the club before <a href="Jim%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201940%29">Jim Smith</a> took over in 1978. With relegation a certainty, the club sold <a href="Trevor%20Francis">Trevor Francis</a> to <a href="Nottingham%20Forest">Nottingham Forest</a>, making him the first player transferred for a fee of £1 million; Francis had scored 133 goals in 329 appearances over his nine years at Birmingham.
Smith took Birmingham straight back to the First Division, but a poor start to the 1981–82 season saw him replaced by <a href="Ron%20Saunders">Ron Saunders</a>, who had just resigned from league champions Aston Villa. Saunders' team struggled to score goals and were relegated in 1984. They bounced back up, but the last home game of the 1984–85 promotion season, against <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>, was marred by rioting, culminating in the death of a boy when a wall collapsed on him. This was on the same day as the <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">Bradford City stadium fire</a>, and the events at St Andrew's formed part of the remit of <a href="Oliver%20Popplewell">Mr Justice Popplewell</a>'s inquiry into safety at sports grounds. The club lacked stability both on and off the field. Saunders quit after FA Cup defeat to <a href="non-League">non-League</a> team <a href="Altrincham%20F.C.">Altrincham</a>, staff were laid off, the training ground was sold, and by 1989 Birmingham were in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for the first time in their history.
In April 1989 the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain, bought the club. A rapid turnover of managers, the absence of promised investment, and a threatened mass refusal of players to renew contracts was relieved only by a victorious trip to <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> in the <a href="1991%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup%20final">Associate Members' Cup</a>. <a href="Terry%20Cooper%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201944%29">Terry Cooper</a> delivered promotion, but the collapse of the <a href="Bank%20of%20Credit%20and%20Commerce%20International">Bank of Credit and Commerce International</a> (BCCI) put the Kumars' businesses into <a href="receivership">receivership</a>; in November 1992 BCCI's <a href="liquidator%20%28law%29">liquidator</a> put up for sale their 84% holding in the football club.
Sale and reconstruction (1992–2007).
The club continued in <a href="administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> for four months, until <a href="Sport%20Newspapers">Sport Newspapers</a>' proprietor <a href="David%20Sullivan%20%28businessman%29">David Sullivan</a> bought it for £700,000, installed the then 23-year-old <a href="Karren%20Brady">Karren Brady</a> as managing director and allowed Cooper money for signings. On the last day of the season, the team avoided relegation back to the third tier, but after a poor start to the 1993–94 season Cooper was replaced by <a href="Barry%20Fry">Barry Fry</a>. The change did not prevent relegation, but Fry's first full season brought promotion back to the second tier as champions, and victory over <a href="Carlisle%20United">Carlisle United</a> in the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> via <a href="Paul%20Tait%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201971%29">Paul Tait</a>'s <a href="golden%20goal">golden goal</a> completed the "<a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23Doubles%20in%20lower%20divisions">lower-league Double</a>". After one more year, Fry was dismissed to make way for the return of Trevor Francis.
Reinforced by players with top-level experience, including Manchester United captain <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a>, Francis's team narrowly missed out on a <a href="EFL%20Championship%20play-offs">play-off</a> position in 1998, and three years of play-off semi-final defeats followed. They reached the <a href="2001%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2001 League Cup final</a> against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> at <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>'s <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a>. Birmingham equalised in the last minute of normal time, but the match went to a <a href="penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a> which Liverpool won. By October 2001, lack of progress had made Francis's position untenable; after a 6–0 League Cup defeat to Manchester City, he left by mutual consent. Bruce's return as manager shook up a stale team; he took them from mid-table to the play-offs, and beat <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> on penalties in <a href="2002%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">the final</a> to secure promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>.
Motivated by the inspirational <a href="Christophe%20Dugarry">Christophe Dugarry</a>, Birmingham's first top-flight season for 16 years finished in mid-table. Loan signing <a href="Mikael%20Forssell">Mikael Forssell</a>'s 17 league goals helped Birmingham to a top-half finish in 2003–04, but when he was injured, the 2004–05 team struggled for goals. In July 2005, chairman <a href="David%20Gold%20%28businessman%29">David Gold</a> said it was time to "start talking about being as good as anyone outside the top three or four" with "the best squad of players for 25 years". Injuries, loss of form, and lack of transfer window investment saw them relegated in a season whose lowlight was a 7–0 FA Cup defeat to Liverpool. <a href="Jermaine%20Pennant">Jermaine Pennant</a> and <a href="Emile%20Heskey">Emile Heskey</a> left for record fees, many others were released, but Bruce's amended recruitment strategy, combining free-transfer experience with young "hungry" players and shrewd exploitation of the loan market, brought automatic promotion at the end of a season which had included calls for his head.
The Chinese years (2007–2023).
In July 2007, Hong Kong-based businessman <a href="Carson%20Yeung">Carson Yeung</a> bought 29.9% of shares in the club, making him the biggest single shareholder, with a view to taking full control in the future. Uncertain as to his future under possible new owners, Bruce left in mid-season. His successor, Scotland national team manager <a href="Alex%20McLeish">Alex McLeish</a>, was unable to stave off relegation, but achieved promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt. Yeung's company completed the takeover in 2009, and the team finished in ninth place, their highest for 51 years. In 2011, they combined <a href="2011%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">a second League Cup</a>, defeating favourites Arsenal 2–1 with goals from <a href="Nikola%20%C5%BDigi%C4%87">Nikola Žigić</a> and <a href="Obafemi%20Martins">Obafemi Martins</a> and securing qualification for the <a href="Europa%20League">Europa League</a>, with relegation back to the second tier, after which McLeish resigned to join Aston Villa.
Birmingham narrowly failed to reach the knockout rounds of the Europa League and the play-off final. With the club in financial turmoil and under a transfer embargo, manager <a href="Chris%20Hughton">Chris Hughton</a> left. Under <a href="Lee%20Clark%20%28footballer%29">Lee Clark</a>, Birmingham twice retained their divisional status, albeit through <a href="Paul%20Caddis">Paul Caddis</a>'s 93rd-minute goal in the last match of 2013–14 to avoid relegation on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>, but continued poor form saw him dismissed in October 2014. <a href="Gary%20Rowett">Gary Rowett</a> stabilised the team and led them to two tenth-place finishes before being controversially dismissed by new owners Trillion Trophy Asia in favour of the "pedigree" of <a href="Gianfranco%20Zola">Gianfranco Zola</a>, who would aid the club's "strategic, long-term view" to take the club in a new direction.
Two wins from 24 matches under Zola left Birmingham needing two wins from the last three games to stay up, which they achieved under the managership of <a href="Harry%20Redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a>. Redknapp lasted another month, his former assistant <a href="Steve%20Cotterill">Steve Cotterill</a> five months, leaving successor <a href="Garry%20Monk">Garry Monk</a> anotherultimately successfulrelegation battle. Despite budgetary restrictions and a nine-point deduction for breaches of the League's Profitability and Sustainability (P&S) rules, the team finished 17th in 2018–19; however, Monk was sacked in June after conflict with the board. He was succeeded by his assistant, <a href="Pep%20Clotet">Pep Clotet</a>, initially as caretaker. In the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Birmingham%20City%20F.C.%20season">2019–20 season</a>, a season that was suspended from March to June 2020 due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the club once again avoided relegation despite a 14-match winless run at the end of the season and the threat of a further points deduction. Academy product <a href="Jude%20Bellingham">Jude Bellingham</a> was sold to <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> in the summer for a club-record deal reported to be worth up to £30 million, after which <a href="Aitor%20Karanka">Aitor Karanka</a> lasted eight months as head coach before being replaced by former Birmingham player <a href="Lee%20Bowyer">Lee Bowyer</a>. After 16 months and yet another relegation struggle, amid rumours of an imminent takeover, Bowyer was replaced by <a href="John%20Eustace">John Eustace</a>.
American control (2023–present).
After two takeover attempts fell through, Shelby Companies Ltd, a subsidiary of US-based Knighthead Capital Management and fronted by that company's co-founder Tom Wagner, purchased a controlling stake in the club and full ownership of the stadium on 13 July 2023. Former Manchester City CEO <a href="Garry%20Cook%20%28executive%29">Garry Cook</a> was appointed to the corresponding role at Birmingham, and the club gained considerable publicity from the arrival of seven-time <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>-winner <a href="Tom%20Brady">Tom Brady</a> as minority owner and chairman of its advisory board.
In early October, with the team in the play-off places, Eustace was sacked. In a move that echoed Rowett's replacement by Zola seven years prior, the board stressed the need for "a winning mentality and a culture of ambition" across the club, and a new appointment with "[responsibility] for creating an identity and clear 'no fear' playing style". After former England international player <a href="Wayne%20Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a>'s two wins from 15 matches left Birmingham in 20th place, <a href="Tony%20Mowbray">Tony Mowbray</a> was appointed manager.
Colours and badge.
The Small Heath Alliance members decided among themselves that their colours would be blue; in the early days, they wore whatever blue shirt they had. The first <a href="kit%20%28association%20football%29">uniform kit</a> was a dark blue shirt with a white sash and white shorts. Several variations on a blue theme were tried; the one that stuck was the royal blue shirt with a white "V", adopted during the First World War and retained until the late 1920s. Though the design changed, the royal blue remained. In 1971 they adopted the "penguin" striproyal blue with a broad white central front panelwhich lasted five years. Since then they have generally worn plain, nominally royal blue shirts, though the actual shade used has varied. Shorts have been either blue or white, and socks usually blue, white or a combination. White, yellow, red and black, on their own or in combination, have been the most frequently used colours for the away kit.
There were aberrations: the 1992 kit, sponsored by Triton Showers, was made of a blue material covered with multicoloured splashes which resembled a shower curtain. The home shirt has only once featured stripes: in 1999, the blue shirt had a front central panel in narrow blue and white stripes, a design similar to the <a href="Tesco">Tesco</a> supermarket carrier bag of the time.
When the club changed its name from Small Heath to Birmingham in 1905 it adopted the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Birmingham">city's coat of arms</a> as its <a href="Crest%20%28sports%29">badge</a>, although this was not always worn on the shirts. The 1970s "penguin" shirt carried the letters "BCFC" intertwined at the centre of the chest. The "<a href="Sports%20Argus">Sports Argus</a>" newspaper ran a competition in 1972 to design a new badge for the club. The winning entry, a line-drawn globe and ball, with a ribbon carrying the club's name and date of foundation, in plain blue and white, was adopted by the club but not worn on playing shirts until 1976, after the design was granted by the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> in 1975. An experiment made in the early 1990s with colouring in the globe and ball was soon abandoned.
In June 2020, the club announced a four-year partnership with <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> as supplier of kits, which carry the logo of the club's principal sponsor, Irish bookmaker <a href="BoyleSports">BoyleSports</a>. The 2023–24 home kit consists of a royal blue shirt with a navy wave graphic pattern and trim, royal blue shorts and white socks, while the away kit has a red shirt with a black graphic pattern and trim, black shorts and red socks. Both carry the logo of the club's principal partner, <a href="streetwear">streetwear</a> company Undefeated.
The club rarely spends more than three seasons with the same kit supplier. The first sponsor to have its name on the shirt was Birmingham-based brewery <a href="Ansells">Ansells</a> in 1983. They withdrew in mid-1985, and the shirts went unsponsored until January 1987, when <a href="Associated%20Co-operative%20Creameries">Co-op Milk</a> paid a "five-figure sum" to have its name displayed until the end of the season. That was a relief to the club not only financially: the vice-chairman claimed that as a "big club ... people expect us to have a shirt sponsor and we have been lagging behind". Later sponsors included car retailer PJ Evans/Evans Halshaw (1988–1989), <a href="MK%20One">Mark One</a> (1989–1992), Triton Showers (1992–1995), <a href="Auto%20Windscreens">Auto Windscreens</a> (1995–2001), <a href="Phones%204u">Phones 4u</a> (2001–2003), <a href="Flybe%20%281979-2020%29">Flybe</a> (2003–2007), <a href="F%26amp%3BC%20Asset%20Management">F&C Investments</a> (2007–2011), foreign exchange company RationalFX (2011–2012), "lifestyle and leisure" business EZE Group (2012–2013 and 2015–2016), <a href="e-cigarette">e-cigarette</a> company Nicolites (2013–2014), <a href="mobile%20payment">mobile payment</a> enabler Zapaygo (2014–2015), and <a href="888sport">888sport</a> (2016–2019).
Stadiums.
Small Heath Alliance played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, <a href="Bordesley%20Green">Bordesley Green</a>. As interest grew, they moved to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, <a href="Sparkbrook">Sparkbrook</a>, where admission could be charged. A year later, they moved again, to a field adjoining Muntz Street, <a href="Small%20Heath%2C%20Birmingham">Small Heath</a>, near the <a href="A45%20road">main Coventry Road</a>, with a capacity of about 10,000. The Muntz Street ground was adequate for 1880s friendly matches, and the capacity was gradually raised to around 30,000, but when several thousand spectators scaled walls and broke down turnstiles to get into a First Division match against Aston Villa, it became clear that it could no longer cope with the demand.
Director <a href="Harry%20Morris%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201866%29">Harry Morris</a> identified a site for a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile (1 km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a <a href="brickworks">brickworks</a> once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by <a href="gypsies">gypsies</a> evicted from the site; although gypsies are known to have camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.
The original capacity of St Andrew's was reported as 75,000, with 4,000 seats in the Main Stand and space for 22,000 under cover. By 1938 the official capacity was 68,000, and February 1939 saw the attendance record set at the fifth round FA Cup tie against Everton, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the <a href="Chief%20Constable">Chief Constable</a> ordered the ground's closure because of the danger from air raids; it was the only ground to be thus closed, and was only re-opened after the matter was raised in Parliament. It was badly damaged during the <a href="Birmingham%20Blitz">Birmingham Blitz</a>: the Railway End and the Kop as a result of bombing, while the Main Stand burnt down when a fireman mistook petrol for water.
The replacement Main Stand used a propped <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a> roof design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' view of the pitch. <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">Floodlights</a> were installed in 1956, and officially switched on for a friendly match against <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> in 1957. By the early 1960s a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, roofs had been put on the Kop and Tilton Road End, and the ground capacity was down to about 55,000.
Resulting from the 1986 Popplewell Report into the safety of sports grounds and the later <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>, the capacity of St Andrew's was set at 28,235 for safety reasons, but it was accepted that the stadium had to be brought up to modern all-seated standards. After the last home game of the 1993–94 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolishedfans took home a significant proportion as souvenirsto be replaced at the start of the new season by a 7,000-seat Tilton Road Stand, continuing round the corner into the 9,500-seat Kop which opened two months later. The 8,000-seat Railway Stand followed in 1999; ten years later, this was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager, but the Main Stand has still to be modernised. In 2019, the club website listed the stadium capacity as 29,409.
In 2004 a proposal was put forward to build a "sports village" comprising a 55,000-capacity <a href="City%20of%20Birmingham%20Stadium">City of Birmingham Stadium</a>, other sports and leisure facilities, and a <a href="regional%20casino">super casino</a>, to be jointly financed by <a href="Birmingham%20City%20Council">Birmingham City Council</a>, Birmingham City F.C. (via the proceeds of the sale of St Andrew's) and the casino group <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Sands">Las Vegas Sands</a>. The feasibility of the plan depended on the government issuing a licence for a super casino, and Birmingham being chosen as the venue, but this did not happen. The club have <a href="planning%20permission">planning permission</a> to redevelop the Main Stand, but club and council continued to seek alternative sources of funding for the City of Birmingham Stadium project.
In 2013, the Birmingham City Supporters' Trust's application for listing St Andrew's as an <a href="Asset%20of%20Community%20Value">Asset of Community Value</a> (ACV)a building or other land whose main use "furthers the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community" and where it is realistic to believe it could do so in the future.under the <a href="Localism%20Act%202011">Localism Act 2011</a> was approved by Birmingham City Council. This requires any proposed sale to be notified to the council, and provides for a six-month moratorium on that sale to allow the Trust and other community groups to submit their own bid. In 2018, the club's owners agreed a three-year sponsorship deal under which the name became St Andrew's Trillion Trophy Stadium.
Supporters.
Birmingham fans consider their main rivals to be Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours geographically, with whom they contest the <a href="Second%20City%20derby">Second City derby</a>. Lesser rivalries include fellow <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28county%29">West Midlands</a> clubs <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and West Bromwich Albion. According to a 2003 Football Fans Census survey, Aston Villa fans thought of Birmingham City as their main rivals, though this was not always the case.
Birmingham's supporters are generally referred to as "Bluenoses" in the media and by the fans themselves; the name is also used in a derogatory manner by fans of other clubs. A piece of public sculpture in the form of a ten-times-life-size head lying on a mound near the St Andrew's ground, Ondré Nowakowski's "Sleeping Iron Giant", has been repeatedly defaced with blue paint on its nose. Between 1994 and 1997, the club <a href="mascot">mascot</a> took the form of a blue nose, though it is now a dog named "Beau Brummie", a play on the name <a href="Beau%20Brummell">Beau Brummell</a> and <a href="Brummie">Brummie</a>, the slang word for a person from Birmingham.
A number of supporters' clubs are affiliated to the football club, both in England and abroad. An action group was formed in 1991 to protest against chairman Samesh Kumar, the club blamed an internet petition for the collapse of the purchase of player <a href="Lee%20Bowyer">Lee Bowyer</a> in 2005, and antipathy towards the board provoked hostile chanting and a pitch invasion after the last match of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Premier%20League">2007–08 season</a>, but when the club was in financial difficulties, supporters contributed to schemes which funded the purchase of players <a href="Brian%20Roberts%20%28English%20footballer%29">Brian Roberts</a> in 1984 and <a href="Paul%20Peschisolido">Paul Peschisolido</a> in 1992. A <a href="supporters%27%20trust">supporters' trust</a> was formed under the auspices of <a href="Supporters%20Direct">Supporters Direct</a> in 2012.
There have been several <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s published by supporters. "Made in Brum", first issued in 2000, was the only one regularly on sale in 2013. The "Zulu" began some years earlier and ran for at least 16 seasons. The <a href="hooligan%20firm">hooligan firm</a> associated with the club, the <a href="Zulu%20Warriors%20%28hooligan%20firm%29">Zulu Warriors</a>, were unusual in that they had multi-racial membership at a time when many such firms had associations with racist or right-wing groups.
The fans' anthem, an adaptation of <a href="Harry%20Lauder">Harry Lauder</a>'s "Keep Right On to the End of the Road", was adopted during the 1956 FA Cup campaign. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" football correspondent described in his Cup final preview how Player <a href="Alex%20Govan">Alex Govan</a> is credited with popularising the song, by singing it on the coach on the way to the quarter-final and when he revealed in an interview that it was his favourite.
Ownership.
Small Heath F.C. became a limited company in 1888; its first share issue was to the value of £650. The board was made up of local businessmen and dignitaries until 1965, when the club was sold to Clifford Coombs. By the mid-1980s the club was in financial trouble. Control passed from the Coombs family to former <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall F.C.</a> chairman Ken Wheldon, who cut costs, made redundancies, and sold off assets, including the club's training ground. Still unable to make the club pay, Wheldon sold it to the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain. Debt was still increasing when matters came to a head; the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) put the Kumars' businesses into receivership. The club continued in administration for four months until <a href="Sport%20Newspapers">Sport Newspapers</a>' proprietor David Sullivan bought the Kumars' 84% holding for £700,000 from BCCI's liquidator in March 1993. Birmingham City <a href="public%20limited%20company">plc</a>, of which the football club was a wholly owned subsidiary, was floated on the <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">Alternative Investment Market</a> (AIM) in 1997 with an issue of 15 million new shares, raising £7.5 million of new investment. It made a pre-tax profit of £4.3M in the year ending 31 August 2008.
In July 2007, Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung, via the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Stock%20Exchange">Hong Kong Stock Exchange</a> (SEHK)-listed company <a href="Grandtop%20International%20Holdings%20Limited">Grandtop International Holdings Limited</a> (GIH), bought 29.9% of the plc from its directors. Although his intention to take full control of the club initially came to nothing, GIH completed the purchase in October 2009 at a total cost of £81.5M, re-registered the club as a private company, and renamed the holding company Birmingham International Holdings (BIH).
Trading in BIH shares was suspended in June 2011 after Yeung's arrest on charges of money-laundering. Publication of financial results was repeatedly delayed, which led the Football League to impose a transfer embargo, and offers for the club were entertained from 2012 onwards. After Yeung resigned his positions with both club and company in early 2014, share trading resumed, and following his conviction, efforts intensified to dispose of the club, which had to be done piecemeal in order to retain BIH's share listing.
Going into 2015, the Football League made public their concerns over Yeung's attempts to impose his choice of directors on the BIHL board despite his conviction disqualifying him from exerting influence over a club. Relationships became increasingly factional, as illustrated by the failure of three directors, including the club's "de facto" chief executive Panos Pavlakis, to gain re-election, followed the next day by their reinstatement. On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants <a href="Ernst%20%26amp%3B%20Young">Ernst & Young</a> to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.
In June 2015, the receivers struck deals with the previous major shareholders such that legal action against them would be dropped in return for their agreement not to obstruct any transfer of ownership to their preferred bidder, the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands">British Virgin Islands</a>-registered investment vehicle Trillion Trophy Asia (TTA), wholly owned by Chinese businessman Paul Suen Cho Hung, who in turn agreed that the company would not be sold on within two years. The process completed in October 2016, leaving TTA owning 50.64% of BIH's share capital, a level of ownership that required them to make an offer for the remainder.
To keep the company running, TTA arranged loans which it settled with discounted shares to the same value; the process of creating such shares diluted the percentage holding of all shareholders. Attempts to diversify the company's holdings to make it less reliant on the football club were similarly funded. To reduce the club's losses in light of breaches of the EFL's Profitability and Sustainability Regulations, the stadium was sold for £22.8 million to Birmingham City Stadium Ltd, a new company wholly owned by the football club's parent, and would be leased back to the club, In December 2020, 21.64% of the club and 25% of Birmingham City Stadium were sold to Vong Pech's Oriental Rainbow, and in April 2021, the remaining 75% of the stadium was sold.
A June 2022 attempt to purchase the club by a group fronted by former <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford F.C.</a> owner <a href="Laurence%20Bassini">Laurence Bassini</a>, involving financier <a href="Keith%20R.%20Harris">Keith Harris</a> and with money loaned by David Sullivan, came to nothing. A consortium led by fashion industry businessman Paul Richardson and Argentine former footballer <a href="Maxi%20L%C3%B3pez">Maxi López</a> announced in July that they were close to completing the purchase of a stake in the club, and later confirmed that they were providing operating funds, but pulled out in December citing a failure to agree revisions to the original terms of agreement; in April 2023, Richardson, López and their proposed chief executive, former <a href="Charlton%20Athletic">Charlton Athletic</a> chairman Matt Southall, were sanctioned by the EFL after admitting breaching regulations by taking effective control of the club without approval.
In April 2023, Birmingham Sports Holdings confirmed letters of intent had been signed to sell 24% of Birmingham City plc shares held by themselves and the 21.64% owned by Oriental Rainbow, as well as the whole of Birmingham City Stadium Ltd, to a then unnamed potential purchaser, definitive agreements to be reached within a two-month exclusivity period. The purchaser was named as Shelby Companies Ltd, a subsidiary of asset management company Knighthead Capital Management fronted by Tom Wagner, Knighthead's co-founder and co-CEO. The agreements were subject to approval by the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> (EFL), which was forthcoming in early June, and by the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Stock%20Exchange">Hong Kong Stock Exchange</a> (HKSE), and an <a href="extraordinary%20general%20meeting">extraordinary general meeting</a> (EGM) on 13 July voted overwhelmingly to accept. Although BSH retain 51% of the shares, Wagner confirmed that Shelby were "responsible for the operations of the club moving forward" and that "nothing about the way the transaction is structured will prevent us from obtaining the long-term goals we have for the club."
Honours.
Birmingham City's honours include the following:
League
Cup
Small Heath first entered the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1878–79ten years before the foundation of <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>and won for the first time in 1905, defeating <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> 7–2 in the final. Its importance declined with the increase in League fixtures, and from the 1905–06 season onwards, Birmingham fielded teams containing reserve-team players.
Preparatory to the Football League resuming in 1946–47, the First and Second Division clubs from the <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20Football%20League">last pre-war season</a> were divided geographically between the Leagues North and South for 1945–46. Going into the last day of the season, Aston Villa were top of League South but had finished their programme two points (one win) ahead of the chasers but with a worse <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a>. <a href="Charlton%20Athletic">Charlton Athletic</a> were second, above Birmingham by 0.002 of a goal. While Charlton could only draw at home to <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>, Birmingham won away at <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>, so claimed the title by 0.3 of a goal.
Records and statistics.
Birmingham achieved their highest finishing position, of sixth in the top flight, in the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1955–56 First Division</a>. Frank Womack holds the record for Birmingham league appearances, having played 491 matches between 1908 and 1928, closely followed by Gil Merrick with 485 between 1946 and 1959. If all senior competitions are included, Merrick has 551, less closely followed by Womack's 515 which is the record for an outfield player. The player who won most international caps while at the club is <a href="Maik%20Taylor">Maik Taylor</a> with 58 for <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland</a>.
The goalscoring record is held by Joe Bradford, with 249 league goals, 267 altogether, scored between 1920 and 1935; no other player comes close. <a href="Walter%20Abbott%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201877%29">Walter Abbott</a> holds the records for the most goals scored in a season, in <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1898–99</a>, with 34 league goals in the Second Division and 42 goals in total.
The club's widest victory margin in the league was 12–0, a scoreline which they achieved once in the Football Alliance, against Nottingham Forest in 1899, and twice in the Second Division, against <a href="Walsall%20Town%20Swifts">Walsall Town Swifts</a> in 1892 and <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a> in 1903. They have lost a league match by an eight-goal margin on eight occasions: twice in the Football Alliance and five times in the First Division, all away from home, and once at home, beaten 8–0 by <a href="AFC%20Bournemouth">AFC Bournemouth</a> in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> in 2014. Their record FA Cup win was 10–0 against <a href="Druids%20F.C.">Druids</a> in the fourth qualifying round of the 1899 competition; their record FA Cup defeat was 7–0 at home to Liverpool in the 2006 quarter-final.
Birmingham's home attendance record was set at the fifth-round FA Cup tie against Everton on 11 February 1939. It is variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341. The highest transfer fee received for a Birmingham player is, according to the "<a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a>" website, "a guaranteed £25 million up front" received in July 2020 from <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> for <a href="Jude%20Bellingham">Jude Bellingham</a>, which made him the most expensive 17-year-old in world football; the deal also included add-ons "worth 'several millions more'". The highest fee paid is £6.3m for Croatian midfielder <a href="Ivan%20%C5%A0unji%C4%87">Ivan Šunjić</a>, who joined from <a href="Dinamo%20Zagreb">Dinamo Zagreb</a> in July 2019.

Birmingham City Women.
<a href="Birmingham%20City%20Ladies%20Football%20Club">Birmingham City Ladies Football Club</a> was formed in 1968. The first team worked their way through the leagues until promoted to the <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20Premier%20League">FA Women's Premier League</a> in 2002. After Birmingham City F.C. withdrew financial support in 2005, the club were only able to continue because of a personal donation. They re-affiliated with Birmingham City in 2010, were founder members of the <a href="FA%20WSL">FA WSL</a> the following year, and won the <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20Cup">FA Women's Cup</a> in 2012. A second-place finish in the <a href="2012%20FA%20WSL">2012 FA WSL</a> earned them qualification for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Champions%20League">2013–14 Champions League</a>, in which they reached the semi-final. After TTA took over Birmingham City F.C. in November 2016, the women's club became an integral part of the organisation. It was formally renamed Birmingham City Women in 2018, and would be known as plain Birmingham City except where that would cause confusion with the men's team.

In 1968, under the management of <a href="Matt%20Busby">Matt Busby</a>, 10 years after eight of the club's players were killed in the <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a>, they became the first English club to win the European Cup. <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> is the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies, including 13 league titles, five FA Cups, and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013. In the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a> of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. In winning the UEFA Europa League under <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a> in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a>, they became <a href="UEFA%20club%20competition%20records%20and%20statistics%23List%20of%20teams%20to%20have%20won%20the%20three%20main%20European%20club%20competitions">one of five clubs</a> to have won the original three main <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup).

History.
Early years (1878–1945).
Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> (LYR) depot at <a href="Newton%20Heath">Newton Heath</a>. The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>' reserve team. By 1888, the club had become a founding member of <a href="The%20Combination">The Combination</a>, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed <a href="Football%20Alliance">'Football Alliance'</a>, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name. After two seasons, the club was relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>.
In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £ in 2024 – the club was served with a <a href="liquidation">winding-up order</a>. Captain <a href="Harry%20Stafford">Harry Stafford</a> found four local businessmen, including <a href="John%20Henry%20Davies">John Henry Davies</a> (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name; on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born. Under <a href="Ernest%20Mangnall">Ernest Mangnall</a>, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">Charity Shield</a> and ended with the club's first <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>.
In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a <a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo club</a>, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for <a href="James%20W.%20Gibson">James W. Gibson</a>, who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club. In the <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1938–39 season</a>, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.
Busby years (1945–1969).
In October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the war led to the managerial appointment of <a href="Matt%20Busby">Matt Busby</a>, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions. Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in <a href="1948%20FA%20Cup%20final">1948</a>. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years. They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed "the <a href="Busby%20Babes">Busby Babes</a>" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players. In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> the same opportunity the previous season. En route to the semi-final, which they lost to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>, the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.
The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a>, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a> of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players – <a href="Geoff%20Bent">Geoff Bent</a>, <a href="Roger%20Byrne">Roger Byrne</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Colman">Eddie Colman</a>, <a href="Duncan%20Edwards">Duncan Edwards</a>, <a href="Mark%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201933%29">Mark Jones</a>, <a href="David%20Pegg">David Pegg</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Taylor">Tommy Taylor</a> and <a href="Billy%20Whelan">Billy Whelan</a> – and injured several more.
Assistant manager <a href="Jimmy%20Murphy%20%28footballer%29">Jimmy Murphy</a> took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the <a href="1958%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a>, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> invited the club to compete in the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20European%20Cup">1958–59 European Cup</a> alongside eventual League champions <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>. Despite approval from The Football Association, The Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified. Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as <a href="Denis%20Law">Denis Law</a> and <a href="Pat%20Crerand">Pat Crerand</a>, who combined with the next generation of youth players – including <a href="George%20Best">George Best</a> – to win the FA Cup in <a href="1963%20FA%20Cup%20final">1963</a>. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> 4–1 in the <a href="1968%20European%20Cup%20final">final</a> with a team that contained three <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or%20%281956%E2%80%932009%29">European Footballers of the Year</a>: <a href="Bobby%20Charlton">Bobby Charlton</a>, Denis Law and George Best. They then represented Europe in the <a href="1968%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1968 Intercontinental Cup</a> against <a href="Estudiantes%20de%20La%20Plata">Estudiantes</a> of Argentina, but defeat in the first leg in Buenos Aires meant a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later was not enough to claim the title. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player <a href="Wilf%20McGuinness">Wilf McGuinness</a>.
1969–1986.
Following an eighth-place finish in the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1969–70 season</a> and a poor start to the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1970–71 season</a>, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, <a href="Frank%20O%27Farrell">Frank O'Farrell</a> was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by <a href="Tommy%20Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a> in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club. The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in <a href="1976%20FA%20Cup%20final">1976</a>, but were beaten by <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. They reached the final again in <a href="1977%20FA%20Cup%20final">1977</a>, beating <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.
<a href="Dave%20Sexton">Dave Sexton</a> replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including <a href="Joe%20Jordan%20%28footballer%29">Joe Jordan</a>, <a href="Gordon%20McQueen">Gordon McQueen</a>, <a href="Gary%20Bailey">Gary Bailey</a>, and <a href="Ray%20Wilkins">Ray Wilkins</a>, the team failed to win any trophies; they finished second in 1979–80 and lost to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the <a href="1979%20FA%20Cup%20final">1979 FA Cup final</a>. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction. He was replaced by <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a>, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign <a href="Bryan%20Robson">Bryan Robson</a> from his former club <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup in <a href="1983%20FA%20Cup%20final">1983</a> and <a href="1985%20FA%20Cup%20final">1985</a> and beat <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">rivals</a> Liverpool to win the <a href="1983%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">1983 Charity Shield</a>. In <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1985–86</a>, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.
Ferguson years (1986–2013).
<a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> and his assistant <a href="Archie%20Knox">Archie Knox</a> arrived from <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a> on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1987–88</a>, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> in the <a href="1990%20FA%20Cup%20final">1990 FA Cup final</a>. The following season, Manchester United claimed their first <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">European Super Cup</a> for the first time, where United beat <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a> holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>. The club appeared in two consecutive <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> finals in <a href="1991%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1991</a> and <a href="1992%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1992</a>, beating <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> 1–0 in the second to win that competition for the first time as well. In 1993, in the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">first season</a> of the newly founded <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the club won their <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">first league title</a> since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, they won a <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20FA%20Premier%20League">second consecutive title</a> – alongside the <a href="1994%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup</a> – to complete the first "<a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">Double</a>" in the club's history. United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1995–96</a>, before retaining the league title once more in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1996–97</a> with a game to spare.
In the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> – "The Treble" – in the same season. Trailing 1–0 going into <a href="injury%20time">injury time</a> in the <a href="1999%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">1999 UEFA Champions League final</a>, <a href="Teddy%20Sheringham">Teddy Sheringham</a> and <a href="Ole%20Gunnar%20Solskj%C3%A6r">Ole Gunnar Solskjær</a> scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time. That summer, Ferguson received a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a> for his services to football.
In November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever win the <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> with a <a href="1999%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1–0 victory</a> over the strong <a href="1999%20Copa%20Libertadores">1999 Copa Libertadores</a> winners <a href="Sociedade%20Esportiva%20Palmeiras">Palmeiras</a> in Tokyo. The Red Devils counted on an unexpected goalkeeper fail by future <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a> winner <a href="Marcos%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201973%29">Marcos</a> and a disallowed goal scored by <a href="Alex%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201979%29">Alex</a> to win the game.
Manchester United won the league again in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20FA%20Premier%20League">1999–2000</a> and <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Premier%20League">2000–01</a> seasons, becoming only the fourth club to win the English title three times in a row. The team finished third in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20FA%20Premier%20League">2001–02</a>, before regaining the title in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League">2002–03</a>. They won the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FA%20Cup">2003–04 FA Cup</a>, beating <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> 3–0 in the <a href="2004%20FA%20Cup%20final">final</a> at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> to lift the trophy for a record 11th time. In the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">2005–06 season</a>, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> in the <a href="2006%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2006 Football League Cup final</a>. The club regained the Premier League title in the 2006–07 season, before completing the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23European%20Doubles">European double</a> in 2007–08 with a 6–5 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the <a href="2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">2008 UEFA Champions League final</a> in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. <a href="Ryan%20Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the <a href="2008%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a> after beating <a href="LDU%20Quito">LDU Quito</a> 1–0 in the final. Manchester United followed this with the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20Cup">2008–09 Football League Cup</a>, and its third successive Premier League title. That summer, forward <a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley to retain the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.
After finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Premier%20League">2009–10 season</a>, United achieved a record 19th league title in <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Premier%20League">2010–11</a>, securing the championship with a 1–1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011. This was extended to 20 league titles in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Premier%20League">2012–13</a>, securing the championship with a 3–0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.
2013–present.
On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. He retired as the most decorated manager in football history. The club announced the next day that <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> manager <a href="David%20Moyes">David Moyes</a> would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96. They also failed to qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>, the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990. On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that <a href="Louis%20van%20Gaal">Louis van Gaal</a> would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant. <a href="Malcolm%20Glazer">Malcolm Glazer</a>, the patriarch of the <a href="Glazer%20ownership%20of%20Manchester%20United">family that owns the club</a>, died on 28 May 2014.
Under Van Gaal, United won a <a href="2016%20FA%20Cup%20final">12th FA Cup</a>, but a disappointing slump in the middle of his second season led to rumours of the board sounding out potential replacements. Van Gaal was ultimately sacked just two days after the cup final victory, with United having finished fifth in the league. Former <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a>, Chelsea, <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> and Real Madrid manager <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a> was appointed in his place on 27 May 2016. Mourinho signed a three-year contract, and in his first season won the <a href="2016%20FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>, <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20EFL%20Cup">EFL Cup</a> and <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>. <a href="Wayne%20Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> scored his 250th goal for United, a stoppage-time equaliser in a league game against <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> in January 2017, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as the club's all-time top scorer. The following season, United finished second in the league – their highest league placing since 2013 – but were still 19 points behind <a href="Manchester%20derby">rivals</a> Manchester City. Mourinho also guided the club to a 19th <a href="2018%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a>, but they lost 1–0 to Chelsea. On 18 December 2018, with United in sixth place in the Premier League table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League places, Mourinho was sacked after 144 games in charge. The following day, former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. On 28 March 2019, after winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskjær was appointed permanent manager on a three-year deal.
On 18 April 2021, Manchester United announced they were joining 11 other European clubs as founding members of the <a href="European%20Super%20League">European Super League</a>, a proposed 20-team competition intended to rival the UEFA Champions League. The announcement drew a significant backlash from supporters, other clubs, media partners, sponsors, players and the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">UK Government</a>, forcing the club to withdraw just two days later. The failure of the project led to the resignation of executive vice-chairman <a href="Ed%20Woodward">Ed Woodward</a>, while <a href="2021%20Old%20Trafford%20protests">resultant protests</a> against Woodward and the Glazer family led to a pitch invasion ahead of a league match against Liverpool on 2 May 2021, which saw the first postponement of a Premier League game due to supporter protests in the competition's history.
On the pitch, United equalled their own record for the biggest win in Premier League history with a <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.%209%E2%80%930%20Southampton%20F.C.">9–0 win</a> over Southampton on 2 February 2021, but ended the season with defeat on penalties in the <a href="2021%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20final">UEFA Europa League final</a> against <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a>, going four straight seasons without a trophy. On 20 November 2021, Solskjær left his role as manager. Former midfielder <a href="Michael%20Carrick">Michael Carrick</a> took charge for the next three games, before the appointment of <a href="Ralf%20Rangnick">Ralf Rangnick</a> as interim manager until the end of the season.
On 21 April 2022, <a href="Erik%20ten%20Hag">Erik ten Hag</a> was appointed as the manager from the end of the 2021–22 season, signing a contract until June 2025 with the option of extending for a further year. Ten Hag won Manchester United the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20EFL%20Cup">2022–23 EFL Cup</a> against <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, winning 2–0. On 5 March 2023, the club suffered their joint-heaviest defeat, losing 7–0 to rivals Liverpool at Anfield.
Crest and colours.
The club <a href="Crest%20%28sports%29">crest</a> is derived from the <a href="Manchester%20City%20Council%23Coat%20of%20arms">Manchester City Council coat of arms</a>, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail. The devil stems from the club's nickname "The Red Devils" inspired from <a href="Salford%20Rugby%20Club">Salford Rugby Club</a>; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971. In 1975, the red devil ("A devil facing the sinister guardant supporting with both hands a trident gules") was granted as a <a href="heraldic%20badge">heraldic badge</a> by the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> for use by Manchester United. In 2023, the Red Devil motif alone, which had been used in promotional items and merchandise previously, was used as the sole badge on the Manchester United third kit. The existing crest remains on the home and away kits.
Newton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'. A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue <a href="knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29">knickerbockers</a>. Between 1894 and 1896, the players wore green and gold jerseys which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.
After the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit. Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red "V" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the <a href="1909%20FA%20Cup%20final">1909 FA Cup final</a>. They remained part of their home kits until 1927. For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.
The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018–19, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit. Since 1997–98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility. The current home kit is a red shirt with <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>' trademark <a href="three%20stripes">three stripes</a> in red on the shoulders, white shorts, and black socks.
The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999–2000 season, and the 2011–12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops 
made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks. An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995–96 season was dropped after just five games; in its final outing against Southampton, Alex Ferguson instructed the team to change into the third kit during half-time. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit in five attempts. In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as "Manchester United", a reversible white and gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.
The club's third kit is often all-blue; this was most recently the case during the 2014–15 season. Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and once in 1996–97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998–99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and 2005–06. From 2006–07 to 2013–14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006–07 and 2010–11, apart from the 2008–09 season, when an all-blue kit was launched to mark the 40th anniversary of the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20European%20Cup">1967–68 European Cup</a> success.
Grounds.
1878–1893: North Road.
Newton Heath initially played on a field on <a href="North%20Road%20%28football%20ground%29">North Road</a>, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators. Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> on 4 March 1893. A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.
1893–1910: Bank Street.
In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary <a href="A.%20H.%20Albut">A. H. Albut</a> procured the use of the <a href="Bank%20Street%20%28football%20ground%29">Bank Street ground</a> in <a href="Clayton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Clayton</a>. It initially had no stands, by the start of the <a href="1893%E2%80%9394%20Newton%20Heath%20F.C.%20season">1893–94 season</a>, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the "Bradford end". At the opposite end, the "Clayton end", the ground had been "built up, thousands thus being provided for". Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw <a href="Alf%20Farman">Alf Farman</a> score a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3–2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later. In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the <a href="Broughton%20Rangers">Broughton Rangers</a> <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> club, and put up another stand on the "reserved side" (as distinct from the "popular side"); however, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.
When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at <a href="Harpurhey">Harpurhey</a> for the next reserves game against Padiham. Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.
1910–present: Old Trafford.
Following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition; in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> drew 76,962 spectators.
Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the <a href="War%20Damage%20Commission">War Damage Commission</a> in the amount of £22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its "home" games at Manchester City's <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a> ground; Manchester United was charged £5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts. Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a>ed structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1993–94 season</a>. First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £40,000, four pylons were erected, each housing 54 individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.
The <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>'s requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998–99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record. The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> 4–1, with just 114 seats (0.15 per cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied. In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957. Manchester United has the <a href="List%20of%20association%20football%20clubs%20by%20average%20attendance">second highest average attendance of European football clubs</a> only behind <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. In 2021 United co-chairman Joel Glazer said that "early-stage planning work" for the redevelopment of Old Trafford was underway. This followed "increasing criticism" over the lack of development of the ground since 2006.
Support.
Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a> estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide. The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and Real Madrid), with over <a href="List%20of%20most-followed%20Facebook%20pages">82 million Facebook followers</a> as of July 2023. A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.
Supporters are represented by two independent bodies; the <a href="Independent%20Manchester%20United%20Supporters%27%20Association">Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association</a> (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum, and the <a href="Manchester%20United%20Supporters%27%20Trust">Manchester United Supporters' Trust</a> (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, <a href="F.C.%20United%20of%20Manchester">F.C. United of Manchester</a>. The West Stand of Old Trafford – the "<a href="Stretford%20End">Stretford End</a>" – is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.
Rivalries.
Manchester United have rivalries with Arsenal, <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>, Liverpool, and Manchester City, against whom they contest the Manchester derby.
The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> was a major port. The two clubs are the most successful English teams in both domestic and international competitions; and between them they have won <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">39 league titles</a>, 9 European Cups, 4 <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cups</a>, 5 UEFA Super Cups, 20 FA Cups, 14 League Cups, 2 <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>s, 1 Intercontinental Cup and 37 <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>s. Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by "<a href="France%20Football">France Football</a>" magazine based on metrics such as fanbase and historical importance, Manchester United v Liverpool is considered to be the most famous fixture in English football and one of the biggest rivalries in the football world. No player has been transferred between the clubs since 1964. Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said in 2002, "My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch".
The "Roses Rivalry" with Leeds stems from the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, fought between the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">House of Lancaster</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20York">House of York</a>, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.
The rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams, as well as managers Alex Ferguson and <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a>, have battled for the Premier League title. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match-ups in history.
Global brand.
Manchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412 million – an increase of £39 million on the previous year, valuing it at £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong). In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion. The club is ranked third in the <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">Deloitte Football Money League</a> (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona). In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion. "Forbes" magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion – $1.2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team. They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the "Forbes" list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689 billion.
The core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim. The "iconic" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded "<a href="catenaccio">catenaccio</a>" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) "captured the imagination of the English footballing public". Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the "<a href="Fifth%20Beatle">Fifth Beatle</a>" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.
As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.
Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the <a href="BSkyB">BSkyB</a> broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51 million, compared to £42.5 million at Chelsea, £39.3 million at Liverpool, £34 million at Arsenal and £27.9 million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303 million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, <a href="MUTV%20%28Manchester%20United%20F.C.%29">MUTV</a> – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.
Sponsorship.
In an initial five-year deal worth £500,000, <a href="Sharp%20Corporation">Sharp Electronics</a> became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season, when <a href="Vodafone">Vodafone</a> agreed a four-year, £30 million deal. Vodafone agreed to pay £36 million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.
To commence at the start of the 2006–07 season, American insurance corporation <a href="American%20International%20Group">AIG</a> agreed a four-year £56.5 million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world. At the beginning of the 2010–11 season, American reinsurance company <a href="Aon%20plc">Aon</a> became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately £80 million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history. Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with <a href="DHL%20Express">DHL</a> reported to be worth £40 million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football. The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner. The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth £180 million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the <a href="Trafford%20Training%20Centre">Trafford Training Centre</a>.
The club's first kit manufacturer was <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a>, until a five-year deal was agreed with <a href="Admiral%20Sportswear">Admiral Sportswear</a> in 1975. Adidas won the contract in 1980, before Umbro started a second spell in 1992. That sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike's record-breaking £302.9 million deal, which lasted until 2015; 3.8 million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company. In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level "platinum" sponsors, including Aon and <a href="Budweiser">Budweiser</a>.
On 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014–15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a>. Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014–15 season, citing rising costs. Since the start of the 2015–16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of £750 million. Plumbing products manufacturer <a href="Kohler%20Co.">Kohler</a> became the club's first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018–19 season. Manchester United and General Motors did not renew their sponsorship deal, and the club subsequently signed a five-year, £235m sponsorship deal with <a href="TeamViewer">TeamViewer</a> ahead of the 2021–22 season.
Ownership and finances.
Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form. In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies. After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000. Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948, but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian, but the position of chairman passed to former player <a href="Harold%20Hardman">Harold Hardman</a>.
Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately £40,000, he accumulated a 54 per cent shareholding and took control in January 1964. When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; <a href="Martin%20Edwards">Martin Edwards</a> went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980. Media tycoon <a href="Robert%20Maxwell">Robert Maxwell</a> attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price. In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to <a href="Michael%20Knighton">Michael Knighton</a> for £20 million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.
Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising £6.7 million), and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from <a href="Rupert%20Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>'s British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of "Shareholders United Against Murdoch" – now the "Manchester United Supporters' Trust" – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any <a href="hostile%20takeover">hostile takeover</a>. The Manchester United board accepted a £623 million offer, but the takeover was blocked by the <a href="Competition%20Commission%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Monopolies and Mergers Commission</a> at the final hurdle in April 1999. A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, <a href="John%20Magnier">John Magnier</a> and <a href="J.%20P.%20McManus">J. P. McManus</a>, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse <a href="Rock%20of%20Gibraltar%20%28horse%29">Rock of Gibraltar</a>, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.
Glazer ownership.
In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800 million (then approx. $1.5 billion). Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange. Much of the takeover money was borrowed by the Glazers; the debts were transferred to the club. As a result, the club went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of £540 million, at interest rates of between 7% to 20%.
In July 2006, the club announced a £660 million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30 per cent reduction in annual interest payments to £62 million a year. In January 2010, with debts of £716.5 million ($1.17 billion), Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504 million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509 million owed to international banks. The annual interest payable on the bonds – which were to mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45 million per annum. Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre. Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the "Red Knights", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest. The club's debts reached a high of £777 million in June 2007.
In August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached <a href="Credit%20Suisse">Credit Suisse</a> in preparation for a $1 billion (approx. £600 million) <a href="initial%20public%20offering">initial public offering</a> (IPO) on the <a href="Singapore%20Exchange">Singapore stock exchange</a> that would value the club at more than £2 billion; however, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a> instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>'s disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3 billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.
The New York Stock Exchange allows for different shareholders to enjoy different voting rights over the club. Shares offered to the public ("Class A") had 10 times lesser voting rights than shares retained by the Glazers ("Class B"). Initially in 2012, only 10% of shares were offered to the public. As of 2019, the Glazers retain ultimate control over the club, with over 70% of shares, and even higher voting power.
In 2012, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" estimated that the club had paid a total of over £500 million in debt interest and other fees on behalf of the Glazers, and in 2019, reported that the total sum paid by the club for such fees had risen to £1 billion. At the end of 2019, the club had a net debt of nearly £400 million.
In 2023, the Glazers began soliciting bids for the sale of the club, and several bids were received. <a href="Jim%20Ratcliffe">Jim Ratcliffe</a>, who owns <a href="Ineos">INEOS</a>, and <a href="Hamad%20bin%20Jassim%20bin%20Jaber%20Al%20Thani">Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani</a>, a Qatari sheikh, were the only bidders who had publicly declared their interest in a controlling share of the club. In March 2023, Finnish entrepreneur <a href="Thomas%20Zilliacus">Thomas Zilliacus</a> also made his interest in Manchester United public.
On 24 December 2023, it was announced that Ratcliffe had purchased 25 per cent of Manchester United, and that his INEOS Sport company was taking control of football operations. The Glazers remain as majority shareholders.

Honours.
Manchester United is one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won. The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886. In 1908, the club won their first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. Since then, they have gone on to win a record 20 top-division titles – including a record 13 Premier League titles – and their total of 12 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal (14). Those titles have meant the club has appeared a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (formerly the FA Charity Shield), which is played at the start of each season between the winners of the league and FA Cup from the previous season; of those 30 appearances, Manchester United have won a record 21, including four times when the match was drawn and the trophy shared by the two clubs.
The club had a successful period under the management of Matt Busby, starting with the FA Cup in 1948 and culminating with becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, winning five league titles in the intervening years. The club's most successful decade, however, came in the 1990s under Alex Ferguson; five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup. The club has won the Double (winning the Premier League and FA Cup in the same season) three times; the second in 1995–96 saw them become the first club to do so twice, and it became referred to as the "Double Double". United became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup in 1999 and are one of only three British clubs to have won the FIFA Club World Cup, in 2008. In 1999, United became the first English club to win the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">Treble</a>. In 2017, United won the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, beating <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> in the final. In winning that title, United became the fifth club to have won the "<a href="UEFA%20club%20competition%20records%20and%20statistics%23List%20of%20teams%20to%20have%20won%20the%20three%20main%20European%20club%20competitions">European Treble</a>" of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/Europa League after <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.
The club's most recent trophy came in February 2023, with the 2022–23 EFL Cup.
Doubles and Trebles.
Short competitions – such as the FA Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup – are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.
Manchester United Women.
A team called Manchester United Supporters Club Ladies began operations in the late 1970s and was unofficially recognised as the club's senior women's team. They became founding members of the <a href="North%20West%20Women%27s%20Regional%20Football%20League">North West Women's Regional Football League</a> in 1989. The team made an official partnership with Manchester United in 2001, becoming the club's official women's team; however, in 2005, following Malcolm Glazer's takeover, the club was disbanded as it was seen to be "unprofitable". In 2018, Manchester United formed a new <a href="Manchester%20United%20W.F.C.">women's football team</a>, which entered the <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20Championship">second division of women's football in England</a> for their <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Manchester%20United%20W.F.C.%20season">debut season</a>. 2023 will see that team enter European competition for the first time.

History.
Formation and the early years (1863–1919).
Although there are reports of the game being played in Stoke in 1863 and the club gives this as its official date of formation, the Stoke Ramblers club was formed in 1868 by <a href="Henry%20Almond">Henry Almond</a>, who had been a student at Charterhouse school where a dribbling form of the game was popular. Almond arrived in the region to become an apprentice with the North Staffordshire Railway Company and, wishing to continue playing the game that he had enjoyed whilst at school, established the first formal association football club in the region. The club's first documented match was in October 1868, against a scratch team brought together for the occasion by E.W May. Harry Almond captained the Stoke Ramblers team and also scored the club's first goal. The club's first recorded away match was at Congleton, a rugby club that were convinced to play a one-off fixture under association rules, in December 1868. From the 1860s, the club played at the Victoria Cricket Club ground; however they switched to a nearby ground at Sweetings Field in 1875 to cope with rising attendances.
In 1870, after two seasons as the Ramblers, the club dropped the suffix from its title and became known as Stoke Football Club. It became closely aligned with Stoke Victoria Cricket Club, sharing facilities and some administrative responsibilities. The club played at the Athletic Club ground, which soon became known as the <a href="Victoria%20Ground">Victoria Ground</a>. It was around this time that the club adopted their traditional red-and-white striped kit. In August 1885, the club turned professional.
Stoke were one of the twelve founding members of <a href="English%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> when it was introduced in 1888. The club struggled in their first two seasons, <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1888–89</a> and <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1889–90</a>, finishing bottom on both occasions. In 1890 Stoke failed to be <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-elected</a> and joined the <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a>, which they won and thus were re-elected to the Football League. Stoke spent the next 15 seasons in the First Division and reached the FA Cup Semi-final in the <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1898–99 season</a> before being relegated in 1907 with severe financial problems. Stoke went bankrupt at the end of the <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1907–08</a> season and entered non-league football, playing in the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League">Birmingham & District League</a> and <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> until 1914, when the First World War meant the Football League was suspended for four years. During the wartime period, Stoke entered the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28football%29%23Lancashire%20League%20%281939%20to%20date%29">Lancashire Primary and Secondary leagues</a>. When football recommenced in August 1919, Stoke re-joined the league.
Victoria Ground and Stanley Matthews (1919–1937).
The club became owners of the <a href="Victoria%20Ground">Victoria Ground</a> in 1919. This was followed by the construction of the Butler Street stand, which increased the overall capacity of the ground to 50,000. In 1925, Stoke-on-Trent was granted <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city status</a> and this led the club to change its name to Stoke City F.C.
The 1930s saw the debut of club's most celebrated player, <a href="Stanley%20Matthews">Stanley Matthews</a>. Matthews, who grew up in <a href="Hanley%2C%20Staffordshire">Hanley</a>, was an apprentice at the club and made his first appearance in March 1932, against <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>, at the age of 17. By end of the decade, Matthews had established himself as an <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England international</a> and as one of the best footballers of his generation. Stoke achieved promotion from the Second Division in <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1932–33</a> – as champions – however Matthews only featured in fifteen games in this season. He did however score his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win against local rivals <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a>.
By 1934, the club's average attendance had risen to over 23,000, which in turn allowed the club to give the manager <a href="Tom%20Mather">Tom Mather</a> increased transfer funds. The club was now considered one of the top teams in the country. It was in this period that the club recorded its record league win, a 10–3 win over <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in February 1937. In April of that year, the club achieved its record league crowd – 51,373 against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. <a href="Freddie%20Steele%20%28footballer%29">Freddie Steele's</a> 33 league goals in the <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1936–37 season</a> remains a club record.
Title challenge and league decline (1937–1960).
Following the resumption of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, tragedy struck on 9 March 1946, as 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a 6th round tie away against <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. This came known as the <a href="Burnden%20Park%20disaster">Burnden Park disaster</a>. In <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1946–47</a>, Stoke mounted a serious title challenge. The club needed a win in their final game of the season to win the First Division title. However, a 2–1 defeat to <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> meant the title went to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> instead. Stanley Matthews left with 3 games remaining of the 1946–47 season, opting to join <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> at the age of 32.
Stoke were relegated from the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1952–53</a>; during the season <a href="Bob%20McGrory">Bob McGrory</a> resigned as the club's manager after 17 years in the role. Former <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> defender <a href="Frank%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201916%29">Frank Taylor</a> took over at the club looking to gain promotion back to the First Division. However, after seven seasons in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> without promotion, Taylor was sacked. Taylor was shocked at being fired and vowed never to be associated with football again.
Tony Waddington years (1960–1977).
<a href="Tony%20Waddington">Tony Waddington</a> was appointed as the club's manager in June 1960. He joined the club in 1952 as a coach, before being promoted to assistant manager in 1957. Waddington pulled off a significant coup by enticing Stanley Matthews – then 46 years old – back to the club, 14 years after he had departed. The return of Matthews helped Stoke to an improved eighth position in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1961–62</a>. Promotion was achieved in the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">following season</a>, with Stoke finishing as champions. In their first season back in the top flight, <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1963–64</a>, Waddington guided Stoke to a mid-table finish. Stoke reached the <a href="1964%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1964 Football League Cup Final</a>, which they lost 4–3 to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> over two legs.
Waddington counted on experience; <a href="Dennis%20Viollet">Dennis Viollet</a>, <a href="Jackie%20Mudie">Jackie Mudie</a>, <a href="Roy%20Vernon">Roy Vernon</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Setters">Maurice Setters</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20McIlroy">Jimmy McIlroy</a> were all players signed in the latter stages of their careers. Matthews was awarded a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">knighthood</a> for services to football in the 1965 New Year's Honours list. This was followed by his final appearance for the club against <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in February 1965, shortly after his 50th birthday. <a href="Gordon%20Banks">Gordon Banks</a>, <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>'s <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a>-winning <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a>, joined in 1967 for <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>52,000 from Leicester. Regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world, Banks proved to be a shrewd signing for Waddington as he helped the club maintain stability in the First Division. During the close season of 1967, Stoke City played in the one-off <a href="United%20Soccer%20Association">United Soccer Association</a> which imported clubs from Europe and South America. Stoke played as the <a href="Cleveland%20Stokers">Cleveland Stokers</a> and finished as runner-up of the Eastern Division.
The club won its first major trophy on <a href="1972%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">4 March 1972 in the League Cup Final</a> against <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. Stoke won 2–1 in front of a crowd of 97,852 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> with goals from <a href="Terry%20Conroy">Terry Conroy</a> and <a href="George%20Eastham">George Eastham</a>. Preceding this victory, Stoke had progressed through 11 games in order to reach the final. This included four games with <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in the <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament">semi-final</a>; the <a href="two-legged%20tie">two-legged tie</a> was <a href="Replay%20%28sports%29">replayed</a> twice. Stoke fared well in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>; the club progressed to the semi-final stage in both the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1970–71</a> and <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1971–72</a> seasons. However, on both occasions Stoke lost to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in a <a href="Replay%20%28sports%29">replay</a>. Stoke also competed in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> in 1972 and 1974 losing at the first attempt to <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> and <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> respectively.
In January 1976, the roof of the Butler Street Stand was blown off in a storm. The repair bill of nearly £250,000 put the club in financial trouble; key players such as <a href="Alan%20Hudson">Alan Hudson</a>, <a href="Mike%20Pejic">Mike Pejic</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Greenhoff">Jimmy Greenhoff</a> were sold to cover the repairs. With the team depleted, Stoke were relegated in the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1976–77 season</a>. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1–0 home defeat to Leicester in March 1977.
Managerial roundabout (1977–1997).
Waddington's replacement, <a href="George%20Eastham">George Eastham</a>, left in January 1978 after only ten months in charge, and was replaced by <a href="Alan%20Durban">Alan Durban</a> from <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.">Shrewsbury Town</a>. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1978–79 season</a>, but after consolidating the club's position in the First Division, he left to manage <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> in 1981. <a href="Richie%20Barker%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201939%29">Richie Barker</a> was appointed for the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1981–82 season</a>, but was sacked in December 1983 and was replaced by <a href="Bill%20Asprey">Bill Asprey</a>. Asprey decided to bring back veteran <a href="Alan%20Hudson">Alan Hudson</a>, and the decision paid off as an improved second half of the season saw Stoke avoid relegation on the final day of the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1983–84 season</a>.
The <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1984–85 season</a> proved to be disastrous. Stoke finished the season with only 17 points, with just three wins all season. <a href="Mick%20Mills">Mick Mills</a> was appointed <a href="Player-coach">player-manager</a> for the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1985–86 season</a>, but was unable to sustain a challenge for promotion in his four seasons as manager and was sacked in November 1989. His successor, <a href="Alan%20Ball%20Jr.">Alan Ball Jr.</a>, became the club's fifth manager in ten years. Ball struggled in his first season in charge, <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1989–90</a>, and Stoke were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division. Ball kept his job for the start of the following season, <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1990–91</a>, but departed during February 1991, in an indifferent season that saw Stoke finish 14th in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>, Stoke's lowest league position.
Ball's successor, <a href="Lou%20Macari">Lou Macari</a>, was appointed in May 1991, prior to the start of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1991–92 season</a>. He clinched silverware for the club; the <a href="1992%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">1992 Football League Trophy</a> was won with a 1–0 victory against <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> at Wembley, with <a href="Mark%20Stein%20%28footballer%29">Mark Stein</a> scoring the only goal of the match. The following season, <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1992–93</a>, promotion was achieved from the third tier. Macari left for his boyhood club <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> in October 1993 to be replaced by <a href="Joe%20Jordan%20%28footballer%29">Joe Jordan</a>; Stein also departed, in a club record £1.5 million move to Chelsea. Jordan's tenure in charge was short, leaving the club less than a year after joining, and Stoke opted to re-appoint Lou Macari only 12 months after he had left. Stoke finished fourth in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1995–96</a> but were defeated in the play-off semi-final by Leicester City. Macari left the club at the end of the following season. His last match in charge was the final league game at the <a href="Victoria%20Ground">Victoria Ground</a>. <a href="Mike%20Sheron">Mike Sheron</a>, who was signed two years previously from <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>, was sold for a club record fee of £2.5 million in 1997.
Britannia Stadium and the Icelandic takeover (1997–2008).
<a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1997–98</a> saw Stoke move to its new ground, the <a href="bet365%20Stadium">Britannia Stadium</a>, after 119 years at the Victoria Ground. <a href="Chic%20Bates">Chic Bates</a>, Macari's assistant, was appointed manager for the club's first season in the new ground. He did not last long though, and was replaced by <a href="Chris%20Kamara">Chris Kamara</a> in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the club's fortunes either, and he too left in April. <a href="Alan%20Durban">Alan Durban</a>, previously Stoke's manager two decades earlier, took charge for the remainder of season. Despite his best efforts, Durban was unable to keep the club up, as defeat against <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> on the final day of the season consigned Stoke to relegation to the third tier.
<a href="Brian%20Little%20%28footballer%29">Brian Little</a>, formerly manager of <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, took charge for the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>. Despite an impressive start, the team's form tailed off dramatically in the latter stages of the season, which led to Little leaving the club at the end of the season. His successor, <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a>, was only in the job for four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by <a href="Stoke%20Holding">Stoke Holding</a>, an <a href="Icelanders">Iceland</a>ic consortium, who purchased a 66% share in Stoke City F.C. for £6.6 million. Stoke became the first Icelandic-owned football club outside of Iceland. They appointed the club's first foreign manager, <a href="Gu%C3%B0j%C3%B3n%20%C3%9E%C3%B3r%C3%B0arson">Guðjón Þórðarson</a>, who helped Stoke win the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, with a <a href="2000%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">2–1 win</a> over <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> in front of a crowd of 85,057 at Wembley.
Guðjón achieved promotion at the third time of asking in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2001–02</a> after previous play-off defeats against <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> and <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a>. <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> were defeated in the semi-final before a <a href="2002%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20Final">2–0 win</a> against <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> secured promotion. Despite achieving the goal of promotion, Guðjón was sacked by <a href="Gunnar%20G%C3%ADslason%20%28businessman%29">Gunnar Gíslason</a> just five days later.
<a href="Steve%20Cotterill">Steve Cotterill</a> was drafted in as Guðjón´s replacement prior to the start of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2002–03 season</a>, but resigned in October 2002 after only four months in charge. <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a> was appointed as Stoke's new manager shortly after. Pulis steered Stoke clear of relegation, with a 1–0 win over <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> on the final day of the season keeping the club in the division. However, Pulis was sacked at the end of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2004–05 season</a>, following disagreement between himself and the club's owners.
Dutch manager <a href="Johan%20Boskamp">Johan Boskamp</a> was named as Pulis' successor on 29 June 2005, only one day after Pulis was sacked. Boskamp brought in a number of new players from Europe, but his side was inconsistent and only a mid-table finish was achieved. Boskamp left at the end of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2005–06 season</a> amidst a takeover bid by former chairman <a href="Peter%20Coates">Peter Coates</a>. On 23 May 2006, Coates completed his takeover of Stoke City, marking the end of Gunnar Gíslason's chairmanship of the club. Coates chose former manager Tony Pulis as Boskamp's successor in June 2006. Pulis took Stoke close to a play-off place, but an eventual eighth-place finish was achieved in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2006–07 season</a>.
Ten years in the Premier League (2008–2018).
Stoke won automatic promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> on the final day of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>, finishing in second place in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>. A 3–1 defeat to <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> on the opening day of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 season</a> saw Stoke written off by many media outlets as relegation certainties. Stoke managed to turn the Britannia Stadium into a "fortress", making it difficult for teams to pick up points there. In their first home match, Stoke defeated Aston Villa 3–2, and wins also came against <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, Arsenal, Sunderland and <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. After a 2–1 win at <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a>, Stoke confirmed their place in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> as the "Potters" finished 12th in their return to the top flight, with a total of 45 points. Stoke finished the following <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 season</a> in a respectable 11th place, with 47 points. Stoke also made it to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1972, defeating <a href="York%20City%20F.C.">York City</a>, Arsenal and Manchester City before losing out to eventual winners Chelsea.
Stoke reached the <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> for the first time in 2011, beating Cardiff City, <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>, <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a>, <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> and a famous 5–0 win against Bolton, the largest post-war FA Cup semi-final victory. However, they lost the <a href="2011%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final 1–0</a> to Manchester City. By reaching the final, Stoke qualified for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2011–12 UEFA Europa League</a>. In the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>, Stoke advanced past <a href="HNK%20Hajduk%20Split">Hajduk Split</a>, <a href="FC%20Thun">Thun</a> and a tough group containing <a href="Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F%20J.K.">Beşiktaş</a>, <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a> and <a href="Maccabi%20Tel%20Aviv%20F.C.">Maccabi Tel Aviv</a> which Stoke managed to progress through finishing in second position. City's reward was a tie against Spanish giants <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> and despite putting up a spirited second leg performance, Stoke went out 2–0 on aggregate. In the Premier League, Stoke made the high-profile signing of <a href="Peter%20Crouch">Peter Crouch</a> as they finished in a mid-table position for a fourth time. The <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2012–13 season</a> saw Stoke make little progress, and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.
Pulis was replaced by fellow Welshman <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a>, who signed a three-year contract on 30 May 2013. Hughes led Stoke to a ninth-place finish in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a>, their highest position in the Premier League and best finish since <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1974–75</a>. The <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a> saw Stoke again finish in ninth position this time, with 54 points. Despite breaking their transfer record twice on <a href="Xherdan%20Shaqiri">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> and then <a href="Giannelli%20Imbula">Giannelli Imbula</a>, in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2015–16</a>, Stoke did not make any progress and finished in ninth position for a third season running. Stoke declined in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a>, finishing in 13th position. In January 2018, Hughes was sacked after a poor run left the club in the relegation zone. He was replaced by <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a>, who could not prevent the club ending their 10-year spell in the Premier League.
Return to the Championship (2018–present).
Following their relegation to the Championship, Lambert was replaced with former Derby County boss <a href="Gary%20Rowett">Gary Rowett</a>. Despite spending nearly £50 million on players in the summer transfer window, results and performances were poor and Rowett was subsequently sacked on 8 January 2019 with the team 14th in the table. He was replaced with Luton Town boss <a href="Nathan%20Jones%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Nathan Jones</a>. Stoke went on to end an uneventful <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2018–19</a> season in 16th place with a record number of draws (22).
After achieving just two wins in the opening 14 games of the following season, Jones was sacked on 1 November 2019 with the team in the relegation zone. Northern Ireland boss <a href="Michael%20O%27Neill%20%28footballer%29">Michael O'Neill</a> was confirmed as his replacement a week later. Results improved under O'Neill and the team managed to avoid relegation, finishing in 15th. Due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a> the entire <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2020–21</a> campaign was played without supporters present as Stoke again finished in mid-table. The following campaign started brightly with the team challenging for the playoffs, though a poor finish to the season saw them finish in 14th. A slow start to the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a> marked the end for O'Neill's time in charge and he was dismissed in August 2022, with Sunderland boss <a href="Alex%20Neil%20%28footballer%29">Alex Neil</a> replacing him. Neil was unable to end Stoke's mid-table purgatory and was replaced by <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a>'s <a href="Steven%20Schumacher">Steven Schumacher</a> in December 2023.
Stadium.
It is not clear where Stoke's original playing fields were located. Their first pitch was certainly in the site of a present burial ground in Lonsdale Street, although there is evidence that they also played on land near to the Copeland Arms public house on Campbell Road. In 1875, they moved to Sweetings Field, which was owned by the mayor of Stoke, Alderman Sweeting. It is estimated that as many as 200–250 spectators were attending home matches at Sweetings Field, paying one penny for admission. Stoke were to stay at Sweetings Field until a merger with the Stoke Victoria Cricket Club in March 1878, when Stoke moved to the <a href="Victoria%20Ground">Victoria Ground</a>.
The first match to be played at the Victoria Ground was a friendly against Talke Rangers on 28 March 1878; Stoke won 1–0 in front of 2,500 fans. The ground was originally an oval shape to cater for athletics, and this shape was retained for the next 30 years. Major development work began in the 1920s, and by 1930 the ground had lost its original shape. By 1935, the ground capacity was up to 50,000. A record crowd of 51,380 packed into the Ground on 29 March 1937 to watch a league match against Arsenal.
Floodlights were installed in 1956 and another new main stand was built. Over the weekend of the 3/4 in January 1976, gale-force winds blew the roof off the Butler Street Stand. Stoke played a home League match against <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> at <a href="Vale%20Park">Vale Park</a> whilst repair work was on-going. The Stoke End Stand was improved in 1979 and through the 1980s more improvements were made. By 1995, Stoke drew up plans to make the ground an all seater stadium, to comply with the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>. However, the club decided it would be better to leave the Victoria Ground and re-locate to a new site.
In 1997, Stoke left the Victoria Ground after 119 years, and moved to the modern 28,384 all seater <a href="Bet365%20Stadium">Britannia Stadium</a> at a cost of £14.7 million. Stoke struggled at first to adjust to their new surroundings and were relegated to the third tier in the first season at the new ground. In 2002, a record 28,218 attended an FA Cup match against <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. With Stoke gaining promotion to the Premier League in 2008, attendances increased. However, the capacity was reduced to 27,500 due to segregation. The name of the ground was changed to the Bet365 Stadium in June 2016. Work began on expanding the stadium to over 30,000 in February 2017 and was concluded in the summer of 2017.
Supporters.
While much of the support that the club enjoys is from the local <a href="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a> area, there are a number of exile fan clubs, notably in London and stretching from Scandinavia to countries farther afield such as Russia, Canada, the United States and Australia. A capacity crowd regularly turned out to see them in the Premier League.
Stoke have had problems with <a href="football%20hooliganism">football hooliganism</a> in the 1970s through the early 2000s, due to the actions of the <a href="Naughty%20Forty">"Naughty Forty" firm</a> which associated itself with the club and was formed by supporter Mark Chester. Chester reformed himself and now works as a youth inclusion promoter. In 2003, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> described Stoke City as having "one of the most active and organised football hooligan firms in England". In response to these criticisms, the club introduced an Away Travel ID scheme. It was subsequently suspended in 2008 as a result of improved behaviour and an enhanced reputation. More recently, Stoke City's fans and stadium have been perceived as loud, friendly, passionate and modern, welcoming as guests <a href="Sugar%20Ray%20Leonard">Sugar Ray Leonard</a> and <a href="Diego%20Maradona">Diego Maradona</a>. There is in the media now "genuine admiration for the volume and volatility of the club's loyal support". Stoke announced that they would offer supporters free bus travel to every Premier League away game in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons.
In November 2008, a group of Stoke fans was forced by the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Police">Greater Manchester Police</a> to leave <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> before a league match against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. The human rights group <a href="Liberty%20%28pressure%20group%29">Liberty</a> took up their case, and the Greater Manchester police eventually apologised for their actions and the fans received compensation. 
Supporters of the club have adopted "<a href="Delilah%20%28Tom%20Jones%20song%29">Delilah</a>" as their anthem since the 1970s, when a supporter was heard singing it in a local pub. Some of the song's lyrics have been adapted for the terraces, but most remain the same. Stoke's official club anthem is "We'll be with you", which was recorded by the Stoke players prior to the <a href="1972%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1972 Football League Cup Final</a>.
Between 2008 and 2011, local fan "Pottermouth" contributed a series of raps to <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Stoke">BBC Radio Stoke</a> about Stoke's <a href="2007-08%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">promotion</a>, their battle to <a href="2008-09%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">stay in the Premier League</a>, and the <a href="2011%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2011 FA Cup Final</a>.
Rivalries.
Stoke's local rivals are <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a>, based in the <a href="Burslem">Burslem</a> area of Stoke-on-Trent. As the two clubs have regularly been in different divisions, there have only been 46 league matches between the two sides, with the last match being in 2002. Regardless of the lack of matches, the <a href="Potteries%20derby">Potteries derby</a> is often a tight and close game of football with few goals being scored. Stoke have won 19 matches while Vale have won 15.
Due to the rarity of this fixture, Stoke have more established rivalries with Midlands clubs <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>, <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> and <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>. A rivalry with Welsh side <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> was formed in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2001–02 season</a> where the sides played each other in the Second Division play-offs.
Kit and crest.
Kit.
Stoke's traditional kit is red and white striped shirts with white shorts and socks. Their first strip was <a href="Navy%20blue">navy</a> and <a href="Cardinal%20%28color%29">cardinal</a> hoops with white <a href="Knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29">knickerbockers</a> and hooped stockings. This changed to black and blue hoops before the club settled on red and white stripes in 1883. However, in 1891 <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> decided that only one club could use one style of strip "per" season and <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> were allowed to take red and white stripes. So between 1891 and 1908 Stoke used a variety of kits with plain <a href="Maroon%20%28color%29">maroon</a> being the most common. In 1908, Stoke lost their League status and were able to finally revert to red and white and when they re-joined the league in 1919 the rule was scrapped. Since then, Stoke have forever used red and white striped shirts, with the only time when they diverted from this was for two seasons in the mid-1980s, which saw them wear a pin-striped shirt.
Crest.
Stoke's first club crest was a stylised "S" which was used by players in 1882 who would stitch the crest on to their shirts; however, this practice soon faded away. In the 1950s Stoke began using the shield from the Stoke-on-Trent coat-of-arms which was used infrequently until 1977. A new and simpler club crest was introduced a <a href="Stafford%20knot">Stafford knot</a> and pottery kiln represented local tradition while red and white stripes were also added. This lasted until 1992 when the club decided to use the entire Stoke-on-Trent coat-of-arms which included the club's name at the top of the crest. They changed their crest in 2001 to the current version which includes their nickname "The Potters". For the 2012–13 season, they used a special version to mark the club's 150th anniversary which included the club's Latin motto "Vis Unita Fortior" ("United Strength is Stronger").

In European football, they have one <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> and one <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>. In terms of trophies won, it is the <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20England%20by%20competitive%20honours%20won">third-most successful club in English football</a>.
Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1893, and they reached the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1904. <a href="Relegated">Relegated</a> only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> and two Championships after the war. In <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">1970–71</a>, they won their first <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">League and FA Cup Double</a>. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles. They completed the 20th century with the highest average league position. Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for nineteen consecutive seasons.
In 1886, munitions workers at the <a href="Royal%20Arsenal">Royal Arsenal</a> in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913 the club crossed the city to <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Arsenal Stadium</a> in <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>, becoming close neighbours of <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, and creating the <a href="North%20London%20derby">North London derby</a>. <a href="Herbert%20Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a>, who changed the fortunes of Arsenal forever, won the club its first silverware, and his legacy led the club to dominate the 1930s. He helped introduce the <a href="WM%20formation">WM formation</a>, <a href="Floodlight%23Association%20football">floodlights</a>, and <a href="Squad%20number%20%28association%20football%29%23First%20use%20of%20numbers">shirt numbers</a>; he also added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's jersey. <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a> is the club's longest-serving manager and has won the most trophies for it. He won <a href="List%20of%20FA%20Cup%20winning%20managers">a record</a> seven FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an <a href="Football%20records%20and%20statistics%20in%20England">English record</a> for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname <a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28football%29">The Invincibles</a>.
In 2006, the club moved to the nearby <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates Stadium</a>. With an annual revenue of £367.1m in the 2021–22 season, Arsenal was estimated to be worth US$2.26 billion by "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>", making it the world's <a href="Forbes%27%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs">tenth most valuable</a> football club, while it is one of the most followed on <a href="social%20media">social media</a>. The motto of the club is "Victoria Concordia Crescit", Latin for "Victory Through Harmony".
History.
1886–1912: from Dial Square to Arsenal.
In October 1886, Scotsman <a href="David%20Danskin">David Danskin</a> and fifteen fellow munitions workers in <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a> formed Dial Square Football Club, named after a workshop at the heart of the <a href="Royal%20Arsenal">Royal Arsenal</a> complex. Each member contributed sixpence and Danskin also added three shillings to help form the club. Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0. The club had renamed to Royal Arsenal by January 1887, and its first home was <a href="Plumstead%20Common">Plumstead Common</a>, though they spent most of their time playing at the <a href="Manor%20Ground%20%28Plumstead%29">Manor Ground</a>. Their first trophies were the <a href="Kent%20Senior%20Cup">Kent Senior Cup</a> and <a href="London%20Charity%20Cup">London Charity Cup</a> in <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1889–90</a> and the <a href="London%20Senior%20Cup">London Senior Cup</a> in <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1890–91</a>; these were the only <a href="County%20football%20association">county association</a> trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London. In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.
Royal Arsenal renamed for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of the Football League, starting out in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> and reaching the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910. Businessmen <a href="Henry%20Norris%20%28businessman%29">Henry Norris</a> and William Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.
1912–1925: Bank of England club.
In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, the club moved across the river to the new <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Arsenal Stadium</a> in Highbury. In 1919, the Football League controversially voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, into the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Football%20League">newly enlarged</a> First Division, despite only finishing fifth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">1914–15</a>. Later that year, The Arsenal started dropping "The" in official documents, gradually shifting its name for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.
With a new home and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal's budget grew rapidly. With record-breaking <a href="World%20football%20transfer%20record">spending</a> and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20club">Bank of England club</a>.
1925–1934: Herbert Chapman's legendary "Gunners".
Arsenal's location and record-breaking salary offer lured star <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> manager <a href="Herbert%20Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a> in 1925. Over the next five years, Chapman built a revolutionary new Arsenal. Firstly, he appointed an enduring new trainer <a href="Tom%20Whittaker%20%28footballer%29">Tom Whittaker</a> who would one day rise to become a fabled Arsenal manager himself. With the help of player <a href="Charlie%20Buchan">Charlie Buchan</a>, implemented the nascent <a href="WM%20formation">WM formation</a> which would serve as a stable bedrock to his outfit. He also captured generational young talents such as <a href="Cliff%20Bastin">Cliff Bastin</a> and <a href="Eddie%20Hapgood">Eddie Hapgood</a>, whilst also lavishing Highbury's high income on stars such as <a href="David%20Jack">David Jack</a> and <a href="Alex%20James%20%28footballer%29">Alex James</a>.
Transformed, Chapman's Arsenal claimed their first national trophy, the <a href="1930%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup in 1930</a>, and League Championships followed in <a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20Football%20League">1930–31</a> and <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20Football%20League">1932–33</a>. Chapman also presided over off the pitch changes: white sleeves and shirt numbers were added to the kit; <a href="Arsenal%20tube%20station">a Tube station</a> was named after the club; and the first of two opulent, <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> stands was completed, with some of the first floodlights in English football. Suddenly, in the middle of the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34</a> season, Chapman died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>.
1934–1947: Shaw, Allison & World War II.
Chapman's death meant work was left to his colleagues <a href="Joe%20Shaw%20%28footballer%20born%201883%29">Joe Shaw</a> and <a href="George%20Allison">George Allison</a>, with both proving to be shrewd & consummate custodians of Chapman's excellent Arsenal team, seeing out a hat-trick of league wins with the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20Football%20League">1933–34</a>, <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20Football%20League">1934–35</a>, and <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20Football%20League">1937–38</a> titles, and then furthermore winning the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20FA%20Cup">1936 FA Cup</a>.
<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> meant the Football League was suspended for seven years. While Arsenal were paraded by the nation as a symbol of solidarity with war efforts, the war took a huge toll on the team as the <a href="List%20of%20footballers%20killed%20during%20World%20War%20II%23Great%20Britain">club had had more players killed</a> than any top flight club. Furthermore, debt from reconstructing an ambitious North Bank Stand redevelopment greatly bled Arsenal's resources.
1947–1962: Tom Whittaker's meteoric "Gunners".
Despite this period of turbulence & churn, Arsenal returned to win the league in the second post-war season of <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20Football%20League">1947–48</a>. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, and meant the club equalled the <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions%23List%20of%20champions">champions of England record</a>. Tom Whittaker, despite his disarming humble & modest disposition, was oft-referred to as the "brains" behind the charismatic Chapman's legendary Arsenal side. He gathered a successful & highly skilled Arsenal side in spite of greatly limited resources, with a fiery and expansive style that drove great fanfare at the time.
They won a third <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup in 1950</a>, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20Football%20League">1952–53</a> making Arsenal the most successful team in English history at the time.
1962–1984: Billy Wright, Bertie Mee and Neill's cohorts.
Arsenal were not to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The '53 Champions squad had aged, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements. Although Arsenal were competitive during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in mid-table mediocrity. Even former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> captain <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a> could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.
Arsenal tentatively appointed club <a href="physiotherapist">physiotherapist</a> <a href="Bertie%20Mee">Bertie Mee</a> as acting manager in 1966. With new assistant <a href="Don%20Howe">Don Howe</a> and new players such as <a href="Bob%20McNab">Bob McNab</a> and <a href="George%20Graham%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201944%29">George Graham</a>, Mee led Arsenal to their first <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> finals, in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Football%20League%20Cup">1967–68</a> and <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Football%20League%20Cup">1968–69</a>. Next season saw a breakthrough, with Arsenal's first competitive European trophy, the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>. <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">The season after</a>, Arsenal achieved an even greater triumph with their first <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Football%20League">League</a> and <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a>, and a new <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions%23List%20of%20champions">champions of England record</a>. This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the rest of the decade was characterised by a series of near misses, with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20FA%20Cup">1972</a>, and First Division runners-up in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Football%20League">1972–73</a>.
Former player <a href="Terry%20Neill">Terry Neill</a> succeeded Mee in 1976. At the age of 34, he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a> and <a href="Pat%20Jennings">Pat Jennings</a>, and a crop of talent in the side like <a href="Liam%20Brady">Liam Brady</a> and <a href="Frank%20Stapleton">Frank Stapleton</a>, the club reached a trio of FA Cup finals (<a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20FA%20Cup">1978 FA Cup</a>, <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20FA%20Cup">1979 FA Cup</a> and <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20FA%20Cup">1980 FA Cup</a>), and lost the <a href="1980%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final</a> on <a href="penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a>. The club's only trophy during this time was the <a href="1979%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1979 FA Cup</a>, achieved with a last-minute 3–2 victory over <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, in a final is widely regarded as a classic.
1984–1996: George Graham's Arsenal.
One of Mee's double winners, <a href="George%20Graham%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201944%29">George Graham</a>, returned as manager in 1986, with Arsenal winning their first League Cup in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Football%20League%20Cup">1987</a>, Graham's first season in charge. New signings <a href="Nigel%20Winterburn">Nigel Winterburn</a>, <a href="Lee%20Dixon">Lee Dixon</a> and <a href="Steve%20Bould">Steve Bould</a> had joined the club by 1988 to complete the "famous Back Four", led by homegrown player <a href="Tony%20Adams">Tony Adams</a>. Graham's credo of prioritising defensive excellence seemingly clashed with the club's traditional expansive motif & the young player demographic at the club at the time, however they quickly gained a cult following after initial successes.
They immediately won the 1988 <a href="Football%20League%20Centenary%20Trophy">Football League Centenary Trophy</a>, and followed it with the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League">1988–89 Football League</a> title, snatched with a last-minute goal in the <a href="Liverpool%200%E2%80%932%20Arsenal%20%2826%20May%201989%29">final game of the season</a> against fellow title challengers <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Graham's Arsenal won another title in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Football%20League">1990–91</a>, losing only one match, won the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> and <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> double in 1993, and the <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1994</a>. Graham's reputation was tarnished when he was found to have taken <a href="Kickback%20%28bribery%29">kickbacks</a> from agent <a href="Rune%20Hauge">Rune Hauge</a> for signing certain players, and he was dismissed in 1995. His replacement, <a href="Bruce%20Rioch">Bruce Rioch</a>, lasted for only one season, leaving the club after a dispute with the board of directors.
1996–2018: Wenger years.
The club metamorphosed during the tenure of French manager <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a>, who was appointed in 1996. Attacking football, an overhaul of dietary and fitness practices, and efficiency with money defined his reign. Accumulating key players from Wenger's <a href="France">homeland</a>, such as <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a> and <a href="Thierry%20Henry">Thierry Henry</a>, Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">1997–98</a> and a third in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2001–02</a>. In addition, the club reached the final of the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Cup">1999–2000 UEFA Cup</a>, were victorious in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Cup">2003</a> and <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Cup">2005</a> FA Cup finals, and won the Premier League in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FA%20Premier%20League">2003–04</a> without losing a single match, an achievement which earned the side the nickname "<a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28football%29">The Invincibles</a>". This feat came within a run of 49 league matches unbeaten from 7 May 2003 to 24 October 2004, a <a href="Football%20records%20and%20statistics%20in%20England">national record</a>.
Arsenal finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of Wenger's first nine seasons at the club, although they never won the title in two consecutive seasons.
The club had never progressed beyond the quarter-finals of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> until <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2005–06</a>; in that season they became the first club from London to reach <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">the final</a> in the competition's fifty-year history, but were beaten 2–1 by <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. In July 2006, they moved into the <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates Stadium</a>, after 93 years at Highbury.
Arsenal reached the final of the <a href="2007%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2007</a> and <a href="2011%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2011</a> League Cups, losing 2–1 to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> respectively. The club had not gained a trophy since the 2005 FA Cup until, spearheaded by club record acquisition <a href="Mesut%20%C3%96zil">Mesut Özil</a>, Arsenal beat <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> in the <a href="2014%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2014 FA Cup Final</a>, coming back from a 2–0 deficit to win the match 3–2. A year later, Arsenal completed another <a href="2015%20FA%20Cup%20Final">victorious FA Cup campaign</a>, and became the most successful club in the tournament's history by winning their 13th FA Cup in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20FA%20Cup">2016–17</a>. However, in that same season, Arsenal finished fifth in the league, the first time they had finished outside the top four since before Wenger arrived in 1996. In his 21st & final season, Arsenal under Arsene Wenger <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">finished sixth</a> & <a href="2017%20FA%20Community%20Shield">won the community shield.</a> Wenger departed Arsenal following the end of the season, on 13 May 2018.
2018–2020: post-Wenger revolution.
After conducting an overhaul in the club's operating model to coincide with Wenger's departure, Spaniard <a href="Unai%20Emery">Unai Emery</a> was named as the club's new head coach on 23 May 2018. He became the club's first ever 'head coach' and second manager from outside the United Kingdom. In Emery's <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Premier%20League">first season</a>, Arsenal finished fifth in the Premier League and as runner-up in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>. On 29 November 2019, Emery was dismissed as manager and former player and assistant first team coach <a href="Freddie%20Ljungberg">Freddie Ljungberg</a> was appointed as interim head coach.
2020–: Arteta era.
On 20 December 2019, Arsenal appointed former club captain <a href="Mikel%20Arteta">Mikel Arteta</a> as the new head coach. Arsenal finished the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">league</a> season in eighth, their lowest finish since <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20FA%20Premier%20League">1994–95</a>, but <a href="2020%20FA%20Cup%20Final">beat Chelsea 2–1</a> to earn a record-extending <a href="2020%20FA%20Cup%20Final">14th FA Cup</a> win. After the season, Arteta's title was changed from head coach to manager. On 18 April 2021, Arsenal were announced as a founding club of the breakaway European competition <a href="European%20Super%20League">The Super League</a>; they withdrew from the competition two days later amid near-universal condemnation. Arsenal finished the 2020–21 season in eighth place once again, not qualifying for a European competition for the first time in 26 years. In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Premier%20League">2022–23 Premier League season</a>, Arsenal returned to the Champions League by coming second to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Arsenal led the league for most of the season, but suffered a series of losses at the end of the run, setting a record for most time spent on top of the table without actually winning the league.
Crest.
Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first <a href="crest%20%28sports%29">crest</a> featured three <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Woolwich">Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich</a> (nowadays transferred to the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20Royal%20Borough%20of%20Greenwich">coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich</a>). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a <a href="cascabel%20%28artillery%29">cascabel</a> on each are clear indicators that they are cannons. This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, "The Gunners", inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.
In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club's name, set in <a href="blackletter">blackletter</a> typography, and above the coat of arms of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Islington">Metropolitan Borough of Islington</a> and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted Latin <a href="motto">motto</a>, "Victoria Concordia Crescit" (VCC) – "victory comes from harmony" – coined by the club's programme editor Harry Homer. For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to <a href="copyright">copyright</a> it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had <a href="Arsenal%20Football%20Club%20v%20Reed">fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle</a> with a local street trader who sold "unofficial" Arsenal merchandise,
Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable.
The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a <a href="sans-serif">sans-serif</a> typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.
Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a <a href="monogram">monogram</a> of the club's initials in red on a white background.
The monogram theme was developed into an <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a>-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors.
From 1967, a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts, until replaced by the club crest, sometimes with the addition of the nickname "The Gunners", in the 1990s.
In the 2011–12 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th anniversary. The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season. The crest was all white, surrounded by 15 <a href="oak">oak</a> leaves to the right and 15 <a href="Laurel%20wreath">laurel</a> leaves to the left. The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub. The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club. The laurel leaves also represent strength. To complete the crest, 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto "Forward" at the bottom of the crest.
Colours.
For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, <a href="Fred%20Beardsley">Fred Beardsley</a> and <a href="Morris%20Bates">Morris Bates</a>, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.
In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter <a href="pillar%20box">pillar box</a> red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist <a href="Tom%20Webster%20%28cartoonist%29">Tom Webster</a>, with whom Chapman played golf.
Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season. In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.
Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, <a href="AC%20Sparta%20Prague">Sparta Prague</a> adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, <a href="Hibernian%20F.C.">Hibernian</a> adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.
In 1941, Luis Robledo, an England-schooled founder of <a href="Independiente%20Santa%20Fe">Santa Fe</a> and a fan of Arsenal, selected the main colors for his newly created team. In 1920, <a href="S.C.%20Braga">Sporting Clube de Braga</a>'s manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of "Os Arsenalistas".
These teams still wear those designs to this day.
For many years Arsenal's away colours were white or navy blue. However, in 1968 the FA banned navy shirts (they looked too similar to referees' black kit) so in the 1969–70 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the 1971 FA Cup Final as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history. The yellow and blue strip became almost as famous as their iconic red and white home kit. Arsenal reached the <a href="1972%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a> again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980 wearing their "lucky" yellow and blue strip, which remained the club's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.
When <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> took over from <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> as Arsenal's kit provider in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.
Until 2014, the away kit was changed every season, and the outgoing away kit became the third-choice kit if a new home kit was being introduced in the same year.
Since <a href="Puma%20SE">Puma</a> began manufacturing Arsenal's kits in 2014, new home, away and third kits were released every single season. In the 2017–18 season, Puma released a new color scheme for the away and third kits. The away kit was a light blue, which fades to a darker blue near the bottom, while the third kit was black with red highlight. Puma returned to the original color scheme for the 2018–19 season.
From the 2019–20 season Arsenal's kits are manufactured by <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>. In the 2020–21 season, Adidas unveiled the new away kit to 
mark the 15-year anniversary since leaving <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Highbury</a>. The new away kit is white, with a marbled pattern all across to replicate the iconic marble hall in the East stand of Highbury.
Stadiums.
Before joining the Football League, Arsenal played briefly on <a href="Plumstead%20Common">Plumstead Common</a>, then at the <a href="Manor%20Ground%2C%20Plumstead">Manor Ground</a> in <a href="Plumstead">Plumstead</a>, then spent three years between 1890 and 1893 at the nearby <a href="Invicta%20Ground">Invicta Ground</a>. Upon joining the Football League in 1893, the club returned to the Manor Ground and installed stands and <a href="terrace%20%28stadium%29">terracing</a>, upgrading it from just a field. Arsenal continued to play their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.
Widely referred to as Highbury, <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Arsenal Stadium</a> was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a>, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing. The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.
Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.
Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a <a href="Grade%20II%20listed">Grade II listed</a> building and the other three stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time. After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates Stadium</a>, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006–07 season. The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company <a href="Emirates%20%28airline%29">Emirates</a>, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around £100 million. Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names. The stadium will be officially known as Emirates Stadium until at least 2028, and the airline will be the club's shirt sponsor until at least 2024. From the start of the 2010–11 season on, the stands of the stadium have been officially known as North Bank, East Stand, West Stand and Clock end. The capacity of the Emirates now stands at 60,704.
Arsenal's players train at the <a href="Shenley%20Training%20Centre">Shenley Training Centre</a> in Hertfordshire, a purpose-built facility which opened in 1999.
Before that the club used facilities on a nearby site owned by the <a href="University%20College%20London%20Union">University College of London Students' Union</a>. Until 1961 they had trained at Highbury.
Arsenal's <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%20Academy">Academy under-18</a> teams play their home matches at Shenley, while the <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%20Reserves">reserves</a> play their games at <a href="Meadow%20Park%20%28Borehamwood%29">Meadow Park</a>, which is also the home of <a href="Borehamwood%20F.C.">Boreham Wood F.C.</a> Both the <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%20Academy">Academy under-18</a> & the <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%20Reserves">reserves</a> occasionally play their big games at the Emirates in front of a crowd reduced to only the lower west stand.
Supporters and rivalries.
Arsenal's fanbase are referred to as "Gooners" – the name derived from the club's nickname "The Gunners". Virtually all home matches sell out; in 2007–08 Arsenal had the second-highest average League attendance for an English club (60,070, which was 99.5% of available capacity), and, as of 2015, the third-highest all-time average attendance. Arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, and <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke</a>. The club's location, adjoining wealthy areas such as <a href="Canonbury">Canonbury</a> and <a href="Barnsbury">Barnsbury</a>, mixed areas such as <a href="Islington">Islington</a>, <a href="Holloway%2C%20London">Holloway</a>, <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>, and the adjacent <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Camden">London Borough of Camden</a>, and largely working-class areas such as <a href="Finsbury%20Park%20%28district%29">Finsbury Park</a> and <a href="Stoke%20Newington">Stoke Newington</a>, has meant that Arsenal's supporters have come from a variety of social classes. Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Hackney">London Borough of Hackney</a> and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal supporters commute to the stadium from <a href="Wembley%20Park">Wembley Park</a>, North West of the capital. There was also traditionally a large Irish community that followed Arsenal, with the surrounding <a href="Islington">Islington</a> and particularly the nearby <a href="Archway%2C%20London">Archway</a> area having a large community of residents with Irish heritage. But Irish migration to North London is recently much lower than in the 1960s or 1970s.
Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters' Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The <a href="Arsenal%20Supporters%27%20Trust">Arsenal Supporters' Trust</a> promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s such as "The Gooner", "Gunflash" and the satirical "Up The Arse!"
There have always been Arsenal supporters outside London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club. A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 113 million. The club's social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014–15 season.
Anthem.
The team's anthem is "<a href="The%20Angel%20%28North%20London%20Forever%29">The Angel (North London Forever)</a>" by <a href="Louis%20Dunford">Louis Dunford</a>. The song is typically played at Arsenal home games before a match.
Other Songs.
In addition to the usual English <a href="football%20chant">football chant</a>s, Arsenal's supporters sing "One-Nil to the Arsenal" (to the tune of "<a href="Go%20West%20%28song%29">Go West</a>") and also regularly sing "Who's that team they call the Arsenal", "<a href="Good%20Old%20Arsenal">Good Old Arsenal</a>" (to the tune of "<a href="Rule%2C%20Britannia">Rule, Britannia</a>!") and "We're the North Bank/Clock End Highbury". The fans also chant "Boring, Boring Arsenal" in self-deprecating reference to Arsenal's reputation during the 1970s and 1980s as an overly defensive, cautious team.
Rivalries.
Arsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbour, <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>; matches between the two are referred to as the <a href="North%20London%20derby">North London derby</a>. There also exists a rivalry between Arsenal and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in the early 2000s when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title. During the 2010s and now the 2020s, a competitive <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.-Manchester%20City%20F.C.%20rivalry">rivalry</a> with <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> began during the Arteta era following a close title race in the <a href="2022-23%20Premier%20League">2022-23 Premier League</a> season.
Mascot.
The club mascot is Gunnersaurus Rex, a smiling, 7-foot-tall green dinosaur, who first appeared at a home match against Manchester City in August 1994 (or 1993). He is based on a drawing by then 11-year-old Peter Lovell, whose design and another similar idea won a Junior Gunners contest; his official back story is that he hatched from an egg found during renovations at Highbury.
The same person, Jerry Quy, has been inside the suit from the start; in early October 2020, as part of cost-cutting brought about by the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20England">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the club <a href="layoff">made him redundant</a> from that and his other part-time job in supporter liaison, together with 55 full-time employees, although they later said Gunnersaurus could return after spectators were allowed back in stadiums. An online fundraiser was begun for Quy, and <a href="Mesut%20%C3%96zil">Mesut Özil</a> offered to pay his salary himself as long as he remains with Arsenal. In November 2020, in advance of COVID-19 regulations being relaxed to allow supporters to attend home games from 3 December, Arsenal announced that Gunnersaurus would return, to be played by a roster of people that could include Quy if he wished.
Ownership and finances.
The largest shareholder on the Arsenal board is American sports tycoon <a href="Stan%20Kroenke">Stan Kroenke</a>. Kroenke first launched a bid for the club in April 2007, and faced competition for shares from Red and White Securities, which acquired its first shares from <a href="David%20Dein">David Dein</a> in August 2007. Red & White Securities was co-owned by Russian billionaire <a href="Alisher%20Usmanov">Alisher Usmanov</a> and Iranian London-based financier <a href="Farhad%20Moshiri%20%28businessman%29">Farhad Moshiri</a>, though Usmanov bought Moshiri's stake in 2016. Kroenke came close to the 30% takeover threshold in November 2009, when he increased his holding to 18,594 shares (29.9%). In April 2011, Kroenke achieved a full takeover by purchasing the shareholdings of <a href="Nina%20Bracewell-Smith">Nina Bracewell-Smith</a> and <a href="Danny%20Fiszman">Danny Fiszman</a>, taking his shareholding to 62.89%. In May 2017, Kroenke owned 41,721 shares (67.05%) and Red & White Securities owned 18,695 shares (30.04%). In January 2018, Kroenke expanded his ownership by buying twenty-two more shares, taking his total ownership to 67.09%. In August 2018, Kroenke bought out Usmanov for £550m. Now owning more than 90% of the shares, he had the required stake to complete the buyout of the remaining shares and become the sole owner. There has been criticism of Arsenal's poor performance since Kroenke took over, which has been attributed to his ownership. <a href="Ivan%20Gazidis">Ivan Gazidis</a> was the club's Chief executive from 2009 to 2018.
Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, operates as an unlisted <a href="public%20limited%20company">public limited company</a>, whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the <a href="FTSE%20Group">FTSE</a> or <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">AIM</a>; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the <a href="ICAP%20%28company%29">ICAP</a> Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a <a href="mid%20price">mid price</a> of £18,000, which sets the club's <a href="market%20capitalisation">market capitalisation</a> value at approximately £1,119.9m. Most football clubs are not listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand. Business magazine <a href="Forbes">Forbes</a> <a href="Forbes%27%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs">valued</a> Arsenal as a whole at $2.238 billion (£1.69 billion) in 2018, ranked third in English football. Research by the <a href="Henley%20Business%20School">Henley Business School</a> ranked Arsenal second in English football, modelling the club's value at £1.118 billion in 2015.
Arsenal's financial results for the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">2019–20</a> season showed an after tax loss of £47.8m, due in part to the impact of the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. The <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">Deloitte Football Money League</a> is a publication that homogenises and compares clubs' annual revenue. Deloitte put Arsenal's footballing revenue in 2019 at £392.7m (€445.6m), ranking Arsenal eleventh among world football clubs. Arsenal and <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a> both listed the match day revenue generated in 2019 by the Emirates Stadium as €109.2m (£96.2m).
In popular culture.
Partly due to their proximity to the <a href="Alexandra%20Palace%20television%20station">Alexandra Palace transmitter</a>, Arsenal have appeared in a number of media "firsts". On 22 January 1927, their match at Highbury against <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> was the first English League match to be broadcast live on radio. A decade later, on 16 September 1937, an exhibition match between Arsenal's first team and the reserves was the first football match in the world to be televised live. Arsenal also featured in the first edition of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="Match%20of%20the%20Day">Match of the Day</a>", which screened highlights of their match against Liverpool at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> on 22 August 1964. <a href="Sky%20UK">Sky</a>'s coverage of Arsenal's January 2010 match against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> was the first live public broadcast of a sports event on <a href="3D%20television">3D television</a>.
As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related novels, "<a href="The%20Arsenal%20Stadium%20Mystery%20%28novel%29">The Arsenal Stadium Mystery</a>" (1939), which was <a href="The%20Arsenal%20Stadium%20Mystery">made into a film</a> in the same year. The story centres on a <a href="friendly%20match">friendly match</a> between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves in the film and manager <a href="George%20Allison">George Allison</a> was given a speaking part. The book "<a href="Fever%20Pitch">Fever Pitch</a>" by <a href="Nick%20Hornby">Nick Hornby</a> was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was twice adapted for the cinema – the <a href="Fever%20Pitch%20%281997%20film%29">1997 British film</a> focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a <a href="Fever%20Pitch%20%282005%20film%29">2005 American version</a> features a fan of baseball's <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>.
Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a <a href="defender%20%28association%20football%29">defensive</a> and "boring" side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1997 film "<a href="The%20Full%20Monty">The Full Monty</a>" the principal characters move forward in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's <a href="offside%20trap">offside trap</a>, in an attempt to co-ordinate their <a href="striptease">striptease</a> routine.
Fifteen years later an almost identical scene was included in the 2012 Disney science-fiction film "<a href="John%20Carter%20%28film%29">John Carter</a>" (director and co-writer <a href="Andrew%20Stanton">Andrew Stanton</a>, a notable overseas supporter of the club), along with other visual cues and oblique dialogue hints and references to the club throughout the film.
Another film reference to the club's defence comes in the film "<a href="Plunkett%20%26amp%3B%20Macleane">Plunkett & Macleane</a>", in which two characters are named Dixon and Winterburn after Arsenal's long-serving full backs – the right-sided <a href="Lee%20Dixon">Lee Dixon</a> and the left-sided <a href="Nigel%20Winterburn">Nigel Winterburn</a>.
In August 2022, <a href="Amazon%20Prime%20Video">Amazon Prime Video</a> released an eight-episode <a href="documentary%20film">docuseries</a> called "". It documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2021–22 season</a>, in which they were the youngest team in the Premier League with an average starting age of 24 years and 308 days – more than a whole year younger than the next team.
In the community.
In 1985, Arsenal founded a <a href="corporate%20social%20responsibility">community scheme</a>, "Arsenal in the Community", which offered sporting, <a href="social%20inclusion">social inclusion</a>, educational and charitable projects. The club support a number of charitable causes directly and in 1992 established The Arsenal Charitable Trust, which by 2006 had raised more than £2 million for local causes. An ex-professional and celebrity football team associated with the club also raised money by playing charity matches. The club launched the Arsenal for Everyone initiative in 2008 as an annual celebration of the diversity of the Arsenal family. In the 2009–10 season Arsenal announced that they had raised a record breaking £818,897 for the <a href="Great%20Ormond%20Street%20Hospital%20Children%27s%20Charity">Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity</a>. The original target was £500,000. In 2022, Arsenal and Adidas partnered up to launch the "No More Red" campaign to support the long-standing work being done by Arsenal in the Community to help keep young people safe from knife crime and youth violence. To promote the event, the club launched an exclusive all white kit that was not commercially available and only awarded to individuals who are making a positive difference in the community.
<a href="Save%20the%20Children">Save the Children</a> has been Arsenal global charity partner since 2011 and have worked together in numerous projects to improve safety and well-being for vulnerable children in London and abroad. On 3 September 2016 The Arsenal Foundation has donated £1m to build football pitches for children in London, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan and Somalia thanks to The Arsenal Foundation Legends Match against Milan Glorie at the Emirates Stadium. On 3 June 2018, Arsenal played Real Madrid in the Corazon Classic Match 2018 at the Bernabeu, where the proceeds went to Realtoo Real Madrid Foundation projects that are aimed at the most vulnerable children. In addition there will be a return meeting on 8 September 2018 at the Emirates stadium where proceeds will go towards the Arsenal foundation.
During 2007 in <a href="Pleiku">Pleiku</a>, Vietnam, Arsenal partnered with the <a href="JMG%20Academy">JMG Academy</a> and the <a href="Hoang%20Anh%20Gia%20Lai%20Group">Hoang Anh Gia Lai Corporation</a> to found a <a href="Hoang%20Anh%20Gia%20Lai%20Academy">youth academy</a> for the <a href="V.League%201">V.League 1</a> side <a href="Hoang%20Anh%20Gia%20Lai%20FC">Hoàng Anh Lai Lai</a>, which saw a selection of Vietnam-based players train with Arsenal; the club ended their partnership with the club in 2017. Additionally, the club formally partnered with a variety of clubs overseas including Virginia based <a href="Richmond%20Strikers">Richmond Strikers</a> and Cairo based <a href="Wadi%20Degla%20SC">Wadi Degla</a>.

This included all 38 matches of their title-winning <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> season, when Arsenal became only the second club to finish a top-flight campaign unbeaten, after <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> (who played only 22 matches) in <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1888–89</a>. They also hold the record for the longest top flight win streak.

They went a record total stretch of 995 minutes without letting an opponent score; the streak ended in <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">the final</a>, when <a href="Samuel%20Eto%27o">Samuel Eto'o</a> scored a 76th-minute equaliser for Barcelona.
<a href="David%20O%27Leary">David O'Leary</a> holds the record for Arsenal appearances, having played 722 first-team matches between 1975 and 1993. Fellow <a href="centre%20half">centre half</a> and former captain <a href="Tony%20Adams%20%28footballer%29">Tony Adams</a> comes second, having played 669 times.

having surpassed <a href="Ian%20Wright">Ian Wright</a>'s total of 185 in October 2005.
Wright's record had stood since September 1997, when he overtook the longstanding total of 178 goals set by winger <a href="Cliff%20Bastin">Cliff Bastin</a> in 1939.
Henry also holds the club record for goals scored in the League, with 175, a record that had been held by Bastin until February 2006.
<a href="Declan%20Rice">Declan Rice</a> is the Arsenal record signing after a deal with <a href="West%20Ham%20United">West Ham United</a> was completed in July 2023, for an initial £100 million. This easily surpassed the former record of £72 million for <a href="Nicolas%20Pepe">Nicolas Pepe</a>.
Arsenal's record home attendance is 73,707, for a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> match against <a href="RC%20Lens">RC Lens</a> on 25 November 1998 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, where the club formerly played home European matches because of the limits on Highbury's capacity. The record attendance for an Arsenal match at Highbury is 73,295, for a 0–0 draw against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> on 9 March 1935, while that at Emirates Stadium is 60,161, for a 2–2 draw with Manchester United on 3 November 2007.
Honours.
Arsenal's first ever silverware was won as the Royal Arsenal in 1890. The <a href="Kent%20County%20Football%20Association%23County%20Cup%20Competitions">Kent Junior Cup</a>, won by Royal Arsenal's reserves, was the club's first trophy, while the first team's first trophy came three weeks later when they won the <a href="Kent%20Senior%20Cup">Kent Senior Cup</a>. Their first national senior honour came in 1930, when they won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. The club enjoyed further success in the 1930s, winning another FA Cup and five <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Football League First Division</a> titles. Arsenal won their first league and cup <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">double</a> in the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">1970–71 season</a> and twice repeated the feat, in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a> and <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">2001–02</a>, as well as winning a cup double of the FA Cup and <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a>. The <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2003–04</a> season was the only 38-match league season <a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28football%29">unbeaten</a> in English football history. A special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season.
Other.
When the FA Cup was the only national <a href="football%20association">football association</a> competition available to Arsenal, the other football association competitions were <a href="County%20football%20association">County Cups</a>, and they made up many of the matches the club played during a season. Arsenal's first first-team trophy was a County Cup, the inaugural <a href="Kent%20Senior%20Cup">Kent Senior Cup</a>. Arsenal became ineligible for the <a href="London%20Football%20Association">London Cups</a> when the club turned professional in 1891, and rarely participated in County Cups after this. Due to the club's original location within the borders of both the London and <a href="Kent%20County%20Football%20Association">Kent</a> Football Associations, Arsenal competed in and won trophies organised by each.
During Arsenal's history, the club has participated in and won a variety of pre-season and friendly honours. These include Arsenal's own pre-season competition the <a href="Emirates%20Cup">Emirates Cup</a>, begun in 2007. During the wars, previous competitions were widely suspended and the club had to participate in wartime competitions. <a href="Association%20football%20during%20World%20War%20II">During WWII</a>, Arsenal won several of these.

Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.

Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club (), commonly referred to as Wolves, is a professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>, England, which competes in the . The club has played at <a href="Molineux%20Stadium">Molineux Stadium</a> since moving from <a href="Dudley%20Road">Dudley Road</a> in 1889. The club's traditional kit consists of <a href="old%20gold">old gold</a> shirts and socks with black shorts. Since 1979, the kit has also featured the club's "wolf's head" logo. Long-standing rivalries exist with other clubs from the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28county%29">West Midlands</a>, including <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> but the main one being the <a href="Black%20Country%20derby">Black Country derby</a> contested with <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. Since 2016, the club has been owned by the Chinese conglomerate <a href="Fosun%20International">Fosun International</a>.
Formed as "St. Luke's F.C." in 1877, the club changed name to Wolverhampton Wanderers two years later and became one of the founding members of the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League">1888</a>. They won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time in <a href="1893%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1893</a>, and again as a <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> team in <a href="1908%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1908</a> following the club's relegation two years previously. They fell to the third tier in 1923, but went on to win the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a> in 1923–24 and the Second Division in <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20Football%20League">1931–32</a>. The team was crowned <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">English League champions</a> three times – in <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Football%20League">1953–54</a>, <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20Football%20League">1957–58</a> and <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Football%20League">1958–59</a> – all under the management of <a href="Stan%20Cullis">Stan Cullis</a>. Wolves also won another two FA Cup finals, in <a href="1949%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1949</a> and <a href="1960%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1960</a>. Relegated in 1965, after 26 consecutive seasons in the top flight, they secured promotion back to the First Division in <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Football%20League">1966–67</a>. Wolves won the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> in <a href="1974%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1974</a> and <a href="1980%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1980</a>, and again won the Second Division title in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League">1976–77</a>.
Wolves suffered a financial crisis during the <a href="Early%201980s%20recession">early-1980s recession</a> that led to the club coming close to <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a> in 1982. In the five seasons between <a href="1981-82%20Football%20League">1981–82</a> and <a href="1985-86%20Football%20League">1985–86</a> Wolves were relegated four times (although there was also one promotion in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Football%20League">1982–83</a>), meaning the club ended up in what was then the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Football League Fourth Division</a> (now <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">EFL League Two</a>) for the first (and so far only) time in the club's history. However, the club immediately started a swift turn-around, and having been beaten in the inaugural Football League play-off final in <a href="1987%20Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division%20play-off%20Final">1987</a>, Wolves won the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> and <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> titles in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Football%20League">1987–88</a>, followed by the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> title in <a href="1988-89%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division">1988–89</a>.
After fourteen seasons in the second tier between 1989 and 2003, Wolves reached the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, founded in 1992, for the first time with victory in the <a href="2003%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20Final">2003 play-offs</a>, though they were relegated after a single season in the top division on this occasion. Wolves won the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> in 2008–09 to return to the Premier League, but endured relegation in <a href="2011-12%20Premier%20League">2011–12</a>, followed by relegation again (to <a href="EFL%20League%20One">EFL League One</a>) in <a href="2012-13%20Football%20League%20Championship">2012–13</a>. The club then returned to the Premier League after first winning the <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> title in 2013–14, followed by another Championship title in 2017–18.
After becoming one of the first British clubs to install <a href="floodlight">floodlight</a>s at its home ground in 1953, Wolves arranged televised "floodlit friendlies" against leading overseas club sides between 1953 and 1956, which were instrumental in the launch of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup (now known as the UEFA Champions League)</a> in 1955. Wolves reached the quarter-finals of the competition in <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20European%20Cup">1959–60</a> as well as the semi-finals of the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup</a> and the <a href="1972%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">inaugural UEFA Cup Final</a> in 1972. Following a 39-year absence from UEFA competitions, they reached the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Matches%203">UEFA Europa League quarter-finals in 2020</a>.
History.
Formation and the Football League (1879–1893).
In the 2000 edition of "The Rough Guide to English Football", the history section on the Wolves page begins: "The very name Wolves thunders from the pages of English football history". As with several other clubs, <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> for example, Wolves had humble beginnings shaped by the twin influences of <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and the <a href="Christian%20Church">church</a>. The club was founded in 1877 as St. Luke's F.C. by John Baynton and <a href="John%20Brodie%20%28footballer%20born%201862%29">John Brodie</a>, two pupils of St Luke's Church School in <a href="Blakenhall">Blakenhall</a>, who had been presented with a football by their headmaster Harry Barcroft. The team played its first-ever game on 13 January 1877 against a reserve side from <a href="Stafford%20Road%20F.C.">Stafford Road</a>, later merging with the football section of a local cricket club called Blakenhall Wanderers to form Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 1879. Having initially played on two strips of land in the town, they relocated to a more substantial venue on <a href="Dudley%20Road">Dudley Road</a> in 1881, before lifting their first trophy in 1884 when they won the Wrekin Cup, during a season in which they played their first-ever <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> tie. Having become professional, the club were nominated to become one of the twelve founder members of the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1888, in which they played in the first round of Football League fixtures ever staged, against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> on 8 September 1888. They ended the inaugural season in third place, as well as reaching their <a href="1889%20FA%20Cup%20Final">first FA Cup Final</a>, losing 0–3 to the first <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">"Double"</a> winners, <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>. At the conclusion of the campaign the club relocated for a final time when they moved to <a href="Molineux%20Stadium">Molineux</a>, then a pleasure park known as the Molineux Grounds.
FA Cup success and world war years (1893–1950).
Wolves lifted the FA Cup for the first time in <a href="1893%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1893</a> when they beat <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> 1–0, and made a third <a href="1896%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final appearance in 1896</a>. The club added a second FA Cup Final triumph (a 3–1 win against <a href="Newcastle%20United">Newcastle United</a>) to their 1893 success in <a href="1908%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1908</a>, two years after having dropped into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> for the first time. After struggling during the years either side of the First World War to regain their place in the top division (a period that was punctuated by another <a href="1921%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final appearance in 1921</a>), the club suffered a <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">further relegation in 1923</a>, entering the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division (North)</a>, which they <a href="1923%E2%80%9324%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">won at the first attempt</a>. Eight years after returning to the Second Division, Wolves regained their top-flight status as <a href="1931-32%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division Champions</a> under <a href="Frank%20Buckley%20%28footballer%29">Major Frank Buckley</a> after twenty-six years away. With Buckley at the helm the team became established as one of the leading club sides in England in the years leading up to the Second World War, as they finished runners-up in the league twice in succession (<a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1937–38</a> & <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1938–39</a>), as well as reaching the <a href="1939%20FA%20Cup%20Final">last pre-war FA Cup Final</a>, in which they suffered a shock defeat to <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>. In <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1937–38</a> Wolves came within a whisker of winning the club's first English league title: a win in the side's last game away to <a href="Sunderland%20F.C.">Sunderland</a> would have clinched things, but in the event Wolves lost 0–1 and thus ended the campaign one point behind the eventual champions, <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. One of the things Major Buckley and his Wolves side attracted a lot of attention for in the last two full seasons prior to the suspension of league football during the Second World War was Buckley's insistence that his players be injected with monkey gland extract to enhance their stamina and performance, a practice that the Football League disapproved of but did not prohibit.
When league football resumed after the Second World War, Wolves suffered yet another final day failure in the First Division. Just as in 1938, victory in their last match would have won the title but a 2–1 loss to title rivals <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> meant that Liverpool were crowned champions instead. This game had been the last in a Wolves shirt for <a href="Stan%20Cullis">Stan Cullis</a>, and a year later he became manager of the club. In Cullis's first season in charge, he led Wolves to a first major honour in 41 years as they beat <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> to lift the <a href="1949%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup</a>, and a year later, <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">only goal average prevented Wolves winning the league title</a>.
The Stan Cullis era (1950–1960).
The 1950s were by far the most successful period in the club's history. Captained by <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a>, Wolves finally claimed the league championship for the first time in <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1953–54</a>, overhauling <a href="Black%20Country%20derby">local rivals</a> <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> late in the season. Two further titles were soon won in successive years (<a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1957–58</a> and <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1958–59</a>), as Wolves vied with <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a> to be acknowledged the premier team in English football at that juncture. Wolves were renowned both for the club's domestic success and for the staging of high-profile "floodlit friendlies" against other top club sides from around the world. Wolves had become one of the first club sides in Britain to invest in floodlighting in 1953 at a cost of £10,000 (£281,308.64 at 2019 prices). Perhaps <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20v%20Budapest%20Honv%C3%A9d%20FC">the most famed of these friendlies</a> saw Wolves defeat a <a href="Budapest%20Honv%C3%A9d%20FC">Honvéd</a> side including many members of the <a href="Hungary%20national%20football%20team">Hungarian national team</a> that had recently humbled <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> twice, leading the national media to proclaim Wolves "Champions of the World". This became the final spur for <a href="Gabriel%20Hanot">Gabriel Hanot</a>, the editor of "<a href="L%27%C3%89quipe">L'Équipe</a>", to propose <a href="European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20history">the creation of the European Cup</a> (later rebranded as the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>). Wolves were one of the first British clubs to participate. In the 1957–58 season, Wolves defeated <a href="Real%20Madrid">Real Madrid</a> 5–4 (3–2 in Wolverhampton and 2–2 in Madrid) in home and away friendlies.
Cup success in the '60s and '70s (1960–1980).
The 1960s began with <a href="1960%20FA%20Cup%20Final">a fourth FA Cup victory</a> and Wolves almost achieved the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">first League and FA Cup 'double' of the 20th century</a> in English football. They were pipped to the league title by a point on the final day of the season by <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>. Despite that bright start to the decade, the 1960s saw Wolves begin to decline. After finishing as <a href="1959-60%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">league runners-up in 1959–60</a> and a creditable third-place league finish in <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a>'s <a href="1960-61%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">'double'-winning season</a>, the team faded and Cullis himself was dismissed after sixteen years in post in September 1964 after a disastrous start to the <a href="1964-65%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1964–65 season</a>. Cullis's dismissal did not prevent the season ending with relegation (the first time Wolves had known relegation since <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">1922–23</a>) and the club's first spell outside the top division since 1932. Exile from the top flight lasted only two seasons however, as Wolves were <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">promoted in 1967</a> as Second Division runners-up.
During the close season in 1967, Wolves played a mini-season in North America as part of the fledgling <a href="United%20Soccer%20Association">United Soccer Association league</a> which imported clubs from Europe and South America. Playing as the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Wolves">Los Angeles Wolves</a>", they won the Western Division and ultimately the championship by defeating the Eastern Division champions <a href="Washington%20Whips">Washington Whips</a> (import of <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a>) in a final decider.
The club's return to the English top flight in 1967 heralded another period of relative success under <a href="Bill%20McGarry">Bill McGarry</a>, with <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">a fourth place league finish in 1971</a> qualifying Wolves for the newly created <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>. En route to <a href="1972%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">the UEFA Cup final</a>, they defeated <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> and <a href="Ferencv%C3%A1rosi%20TC">Ferencváros</a> before losing to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 3–2 on aggregate; a 2–1 home defeat in the first leg proving decisive. Wolves lifted silverware two years later when they won the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> for the first time by beating <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> 2–1 <a href="1974%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">in the final</a>. Despite <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">relegation again in 1976</a>, Wolves bounced back at the first attempt as <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">Second Division champions</a> under manager <a href="Sammy%20Chung">Sammy Chung</a>, and then under manager <a href="John%20Barnwell">John Barnwell</a>, the turn of the decade saw them <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">finish in the top six in the league</a> and win the <a href="1980%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1980 League Cup</a>, when then-record signing <a href="Andy%20Gray%20%28footballer%20born%201955%29">Andy Gray</a> scored the only goal of the final to defeat the reigning European champions and League Cup holders <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>.
Financial crisis, decline and recovery (1980–1990).
The multi-million pound rebuilding of the Molineux Street Stand in 1979 was to be the catalyst for the club's near-financial ruin during the next decade. Plunging match attendances in the early-1980s, at least partly due to <a href="Early%201980s%20recession%23United%20Kingdom">recession in both the national and local economies</a>, and consequent difficulties in repaying the loans taken out to fund the new John Ireland Stand, led the club to <a href="receivership">receivership</a> and relegation in 1982. The club was saved from liquidation at the last minute when it was purchased by a consortium fronted by former player <a href="Derek%20Dougan">Derek Dougan</a>. Initially this takeover, financed by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti of the company Allied Properties, brought immediate <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">promotion back to the First Division</a> under manager <a href="Graham%20Hawkins">Graham Hawkins</a>, but the Bhattis' failure to invest sufficiently in the club soon saw things unravel as the team suffered three consecutive relegations through the football divisions under different managers, as well as the almost-constant threat of the club being wound-up.
In 1986, with the club again in receivership, a deal saw <a href="Wolverhampton%20City%20Council">Wolverhampton City Council</a> purchase the stadium and surrounding land, while a local developer paid off the club's outstanding debts in return for planning permission to develop the land adjacent to the stadium. The 1986–87 season saw Wolves' first-ever campaign in the Fourth Division, where, with the guidance of new manager <a href="Graham%20Turner">Graham Turner</a> and the goals of <a href="Steve%20Bull">Steve Bull</a>, who would ultimately score a club record 306 goals, the team reached <a href="1987%20Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division%20play-off%20Final">the final of the inaugural play-offs</a> but were denied promotion by <a href="Aldershot%20F.C.">Aldershot</a>. Building on that, the team achieved both the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth</a> and <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League%23Third%20Division">Third Division</a> championships in the next two seasons and won the <a href="1988%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">1988 Football League Trophy Final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>.
The Hayward years (1990–2007).
Lifelong fan <a href="Jack%20Hayward">Jack Hayward</a> purchased the club in 1990 and immediately funded the extensive redevelopment of a by then dilapidated Molineux into a modern all-seater stadium. With work completed in 1993, Hayward redirected his investment onto the playing side in an attempt to win promotion to the newly formed <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. Despite substantial spending, neither <a href="Graham%20Taylor%20%28footballer%29">Graham Taylor</a> nor <a href="Mark%20McGhee">Mark McGhee</a> could fulfil this, both managers leading the team to play-off defeats at the semi-final stages in <a href="1995%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23First%20Division">1995</a> and <a href="1997%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23First%20Division">1997</a> respectively. It was not until 2003 that Wolves were promoted, when they defeated <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> 3–0 in <a href="2003%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20Final">the play-off final</a> under <a href="Dave%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201956%29">Dave Jones</a> to end a 19-year absence from the top level. Their stay proved short-lived however as they were immediately relegated back to the newly retitled <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>.
Promotion, relegations and turbulent times (2007–2016).
After former England manager <a href="Glenn%20Hoddle">Glenn Hoddle</a> failed to bring a swift return to the Premier League, the rebuilding of the squad by <a href="Mick%20McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> rejuvenated the club with an unexpected <a href="2007%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23Championship">play-off finish</a>. The club was bought from Sir Jack Hayward by <a href="Steve%20Morgan%20%28businessman%29">Steve Morgan</a> in 2007 and two years later the team returned to the Premier League as <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20Championship">2008–09 Football League Championship</a> title winners. Wolves successfully battled relegation for two seasons before McCarthy's dismissal in the 2011–12 season, which precipitated relegation under his former assistant <a href="Terry%20Connor">Terry Connor</a>, who was promoted to replace McCarthy.
Following relegation, Norwegian <a href="St%C3%A5le%20Solbakken">Ståle Solbakken</a> became the club's first overseas manager but his tenure lasted only six months before a poor run of results saw him replaced by <a href="Dean%20Saunders">Dean Saunders</a> in January 2013. Saunders failed to bring any upturn, culminating in both the club's relegation to <a href="EFL%20League%20One">EFL League One</a>, a level the club had not played at since 1989, and Saunders's own dismissal. Following this, <a href="Kenny%20Jackett">Kenny Jackett</a> was appointed in May 2013 in the retitled position of head coach, and led the team back to the EFL Championship in his first season, setting a new club record points total of 103 which is also an all-time record for the most points accumulated by any team during a Tier 3 season.
Fosun era: Return to the Premier League and continental football (2016–present).
On 21 July 2016, Chinese investment group <a href="Fosun%20International">Fosun International</a> bought the club's parent company, W.W. (1990) Ltd, from <a href="Steve%20Morgan%20%28businessman%29">Steve Morgan</a> and his own company Bridgemere Group for a reported £45 million, with <a href="Jez%20Moxey">Jez Moxey</a> stepping down from his role as a CEO and replaced by <a href="managing%20director">managing director</a> Laurie Dalrymple. The new owners dismissed Kenny Jackett and brought in former Italian international <a href="Walter%20Zenga">Walter Zenga</a> as head coach. Zenga was dismissed after just 14 league games and <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a> appointed as his successor in November. At the end of the season, Lambert too was dismissed, with former <a href="FC%20Porto">FC Porto</a> boss <a href="Nuno%20Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Nuno Espírito Santo</a> replacing him. Under Nuno, Wolves won the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20EFL%20Championship">2017–18 EFL Championship title</a> and returned to the Premier League after a six-year absence.
Wolverhampton Wanderers finished 7th on their <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20season">return to the Premier League</a>, their highest position in the top division since finishing 6th in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1979–80</a>, earning a spot in <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20qualifying%20phase%20and%20play-off%20round%20%28Main%20Path%29%23Q2%2032.1">the qualification rounds</a> of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>, thus invoking their first continental campaign since <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20UEFA%20Cup%23First%20round">1980–81</a>. They lost to that season's eventual winners <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> 0–1 in a modified single-leg quarter-final played in a neutral venue in Germany due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Europe">COVID-19 pandemic in Europe</a>. Wolves replicated their previous season's 7th-place finish in the Premier League in <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">2019–20</a> but with two more points and only missed out on a return to continental competition, both on goal difference and <a href="2020%20FA%20Cup%20Final">Arsenal winning that season's FA Cup</a>.
In the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20season">2020–21 season</a>, Wolves lost striker <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Jim%C3%A9nez">Raúl Jiménez</a> to a season-ending injury (a fractured skull) in November, and subsequently struggled for goals for the remainder of the campaign, finishing 13th. Espírito Santo left "by mutual consent", and was replaced by former <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> head coach <a href="Bruno%20Lage">Bruno Lage</a>. In <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Premier%20League">2021–22</a>, the club finished 10th. Wolves dismissed Lage on 2 October 2022 after eight games of <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20season">the 2022–23 season</a> with only one win and just three goals scored. Former <a href="Real%20Madrid">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a> and Sevilla manager <a href="Julen%20Lopetegui">Julen Lopetegui</a> replaced him. Despite being in 20th place in the league before his first Premier League game, Lopetegui guided Wolves to a 13th place finish. He left prior to the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20Premier%20League">2023–24 season</a> due to a dispute over the transfer budget, and was replaced by <a href="Gary%20O%27Neil">Gary O'Neil</a>.
Colours and badge.
The club's traditional colours of gold and black allude to <a href="Wolverhampton%20City%20Council">the city council</a>'s motto "out of darkness cometh light" with the two colours representing light and darkness respectively. Although the team's original colours upon formation were red and white, adopted from the school colours of St Lukes, for much of their history their home colours have been their distinctive old gold shirts with black shorts.
In the early decades of the club a variety of shirt designs using these colours were created, including stripes and diagonal halves, until the continual usage of a plain shirt design since the 1930s. Before the 1960s a darker shade of gold was used, known as "<a href="old%20gold">old gold</a>", which is still often cited in the media as the club's colour.
Like most English teams, their earliest shirts usually only featured a badge on special occasions such as cup finals. The first such badge to be worn on Wolves shirts was the coat of arms of <a href="Wolverhampton%20City%20Council">Wolverhampton City Council</a>. In the late 1960s, Wolves introduced their own club badge that appeared on their shirts consisting of a single leaping wolf, which later became three leaping wolves in the mid-1970s. Since 1979 the badge has consisted of a single "wolf head" design; the current badge was last redesigned in 2002.
In May 2019, the club won a legal challenge by Peter Davies, a 71 year old retired building industry manager, who claimed he drew the wolf head motif as a schoolboy in the 1960s and entered it in an art competition. Mr Davies said he came up with the angular design after a teacher asked him to demonstrate an understanding of Blaise Pascal's Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem, and entered it in an art competition advertised in the Express and Star newspaper. Mr Davies had made a copyright claim and wanted compensation. Mr Davies lost his copyright infringement claim and now faces legal fees and costs estimated to be about £450,000.
Wolves' traditional away colours have been all-white, but recent decades have seen a variety of colours used, including black, blue, teal, purple and maroon. 
Stadium.
Former grounds.
When first founded the club used a field on Goldthorn Hill in the <a href="Blakenhall">Blakenhall</a> area as its home, which could accommodate some 2,000 spectators. In 1879 they relocated to John Harper's Field on Lower Villiers Street where they remained for two years before a short move to <a href="Dudley%20Road">Dudley Road</a>, with the new ground situated opposite the Fighting Cocks Inn. It was here that they played their first <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> tie in 1883 and their first Football League fixture in September 1888. Although the site could only hold 2,500 spectators at first it was eventually developed to be capable of 10,000.
Molineux.
In the summer of 1889 the club moved to its permanent home ever since, <a href="Molineux%20Stadium">Molineux</a>, in the <a href="Whitmore%20Reans">Whitmore Reans</a> area of the city. The stadium name originates from the <a href="Molineux%20Hotel">Molineux House</a> built in the area by Benjamin Molineux, a local merchant, in the 18th century and whose grounds were later developed to include numerous public leisure facilities. When the Northampton Brewery Company purchased these grounds in 1889, they rented their use to the city's football club, who were seeking to find a home more befitting a Football League member. After renovating the site, the first ever official game was staged on 7 September 1889 before a crowd of 4,000. The ground was capable of hosting 20,000 spectators, although English football crowds rarely reached that number in the 19th century.
Wolves bought the <a href="freehold%20%28law%29">freehold</a> in 1923 and soon began a series of ground improvements under the auspices of <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a>, beginning with the construction of a major grandstand on the Waterloo Road side. In 1932, the club also built a new stand on the Molineux Street side and followed this by adding a roof to the South Bank two years later; this South Bank was historically the second largest of all <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadiums%29">Kop ends</a> in the country and regularly held crowds in excess of 30,000. The stadium finally now had four complete stands that would form its basis for the next half-century.
In the days before seating regulations, the ground could hold more than 60,000 spectators, with the record attendance being 61,315 for a <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> match against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> on 11 February 1939. The 1940s and 1950s saw average attendances for seasons regularly exceed 40,000, coinciding with the club's peak on the field. During this time Molineux became one of the first British grounds to install floodlights, enabling it to host a series of midweek friendlies against teams from around the globe. In the days prior to the formation of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> and international club competitions, these games were highly prestigious and gained huge crowds and interest with the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> often televising such events.
When the Molineux Street Stand failed to meet new safety legislation, the club began building a new replacement stand behind the existing one on land where housing had been demolished. This new all-seater stand – named the John Ireland Stand after the then-club president – was completed in 1979 and was the first stage of a plan to rebuild the entire stadium. The cost of the Ireland Stand escalated to over £2 million and plunged the club into a financial crisis. As a result, it was forced to enter receivership in 1982. By the time the team dropped into the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> in 1986, only the John Ireland Stand and the South Bank terrace remained in use. New safety laws were implemented following the <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">Bradford City stadium fire</a> and these forced the closure of both the now-dilapidated North Bank and Waterloo Road Stand. The club did not have the funds necessary to rebuild them.
Following the takeover of the club by <a href="Jack%20Hayward">Sir Jack Hayward</a> in 1990, £8.5 million of funding was made available to redevelop Molineux comprehensively. Between August 1991 and December 1993 three sides of the stadium were completely rebuilt to form a 28,525 capacity all-seater stadium that complied with the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>: the Waterloo Road Stand was replaced by the <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a> Stand, the North Bank terrace by the <a href="Stan%20Cullis">Stan Cullis</a> Stand, and the South Bank terrace by the Sir Jack Hayward Stand (named the Jack Harris Stand until 2015). Aside from the addition of a temporary seating area in the southwest corner used during Wolves' seasons in the Premier League; this redevelopment formed the stadium for almost twenty years.
In 2010, plans were unveiled for an extensive redevelopment programme to enlarge the capacity and develop the facilities. The first stage of this saw a new two-tier Stan Cullis Stand become fully operational for <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20season">the 2012–13 season</a>, raising the current official capacity to 31,700. The proposed second stage concerned the rebuilding of the oldest stand at the stadium (built in 1979 as the John Ireland Stand and renamed the Steve Bull Stand in 2003) to increase capacity to around 36,000, but this and any further work was shelved when it became likely that the club would be relegated from the Premier League in 2012.
Ground redevelopments were once again placed on the agenda following the club's acquisition by Fosun in 2016. In contrast to previously mooted plans, it was publicly revealed in February 2019 that future plans consisting of the demolition and full rebuild of the Steve Bull Stand, followed by the redevelopment of the Sir Jack Hayward Stand, to raise the stadium capacity to 45-46,000, were under active consideration. However, in 2020 the club announced more modest plans for making gradual improvements to the stadium as the club seeks to retain its unique character, and enable prioritisation of investment in the playing side of the club.
Players.
Development squad and Academy.
Wolverhampton Wanderers Under-23s are competing in Division 2 of the <a href="Professional%20Development%20League">Premier League 2</a> during the current season, following relegation from the highest level after the previous season was curtailed and decided on a point-per-game basis. The team qualifies as an entrant in Premier League 2 by virtue of Wolves's academy holding Category 1 status. Although the league is designed for players aged 23 and below, three overage players may also feature. Home games are primarily staged at <a href="Kidderminster%20Harriers%20F.C.">Kidderminster Harriers</a>' <a href="Aggborough%20Stadium">Aggborough</a> home.
The following academy players have featured in a matchday squad for the 2023–24 season
Wolves Women.
Originally founded in 1975, Wolves Women became the club's official women's team in 2008. They currently play at the third level of English women's football in the <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20National%20League%20North">FA Women's National League North</a>. Their home games are played at the New Bucks Head Ground in Telford.

Managerial history.
Wolves have had 32 different (permanently appointed) managers during the club's existence. The first manager, <a href="George%20Worrall">George Worrall</a>, was identified by the title of "club secretary", a post that continued until the appointment of a full-time manager in the modern sense was made in 1922.
The club's most successful manager is <a href="Stan%20Cullis">Stan Cullis</a>, whose 16-year tenure brought all three of Wolves' league championships as well as two FA Cup triumphs. Two other managers have been inducted into the Club Hall of Fame: <a href="Frank%20Buckley%20%28footballer%29">Major Frank Buckley</a> and <a href="Graham%20Turner">Graham Turner</a>. Turner oversaw two successive divisional championship wins in the late-1980s, winning the <a href="1987-88%20Football%20League%23Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division title in 1987-88</a> and the <a href="1988-89%20Football%20League%23Third%20Division">Third Division title the following season</a>. <a href="Bill%20McGarry%20%28footballer%29">Bill McGarry</a> and <a href="John%20Barnwell">John Barnwell</a> both won the <a href="League%20Cup">League Cup</a> for Wolves in the 1970s and 1980s.
In the 21st century, <a href="Dave%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201956%29">Dave Jones</a>, <a href="Mick%20McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> and <a href="Nuno%20Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Nuno Espírito Santo</a> have led the club into the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. <a href="Kenny%20Jackett">Kenny Jackett</a> took Wolves to a record <a href="EFL%20League%20One">EFL League One</a> (Tier 3) points haul of 103 as they won this division in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Football%20League%20One">2013–14</a>.
<a href="St%C3%A5le%20Solbakken">Ståle Solbakken</a> became Wolves’ first foreign manager under <a href="Steve%20Morgan%20%28businessman%29">Steve Morgan</a>’s ownership, followed later by <a href="Walter%20Zenga">Walter Zenga</a>, two Portuguese managers <a href="Nuno%20Espirito%20Santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> and <a href="Bruno%20Lage">Bruno Lage</a>, and <a href="Julen%20Lopetegui">Julen Lopetegui</a> who is Spanish, under current owners <a href="Fosun">Fosun</a>.
Wolves have also been managed by two former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a> managers in <a href="Graham%20Taylor">Graham Taylor</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Hoddle">Glenn Hoddle</a>.
Support.
As well as having numerous supporters' clubs across the United Kingdom, Wolverhampton Wanderers also have an international support base, with supporters' clubs in Australia, United States, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Malta, Iceland and Norway amongst others. They have a particularly sizeable Scandinavian fanbase, due to the area's television coverage of Midlands football in the 1970s when the club were a regular top-flight team; the first-ever English match shown live in both Sweden and Norway involved Wolves (Wolverhampton Wanderers 1–0 <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Football League First Division</a> on Saturday, <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20in%20English%20football">29 November 1969</a>).
Rivalries.
Wolves' longest-established and strongest rivalry is with <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>, against whom the club contest the <a href="Black%20Country%20derby">Black Country derby</a>. The two clubs, separated by eleven miles, have faced each other 163 times; their first competitive clash being an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> tie in 1886. A national survey by the <a href="football%20pools">football pools</a> found the rivalry to be the strongest in English football. Both clubs are founder members of the Football League and the two once contested the league title in <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20season">1953–54</a>, with Wolves finishing as champions.
Wolves also share rivalries with the two Birmingham clubs, <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> and <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>, against whom there have been numerous matches dating back to the 19th century. Wolves' closest geographic rival is actually <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> but, as they have rarely competed at the same level, it is of less significance. As Wolverhampton historically sat within the boundaries of <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>, a Staffordshire derby between Wolves and <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> is also recognised.
The 2018–19 Premier League season was the first and only time ever that Wolves were the sole representatives of the West Midlands in the top flight of English football. The 2020–21 Premier League season saw Wolves play against both Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion. Since Albion's relegation at the end of that season, Aston Villa has been Wolves' only West Midlands rival in the Premier League.
Fan culture.
During the club's peak in the 1950s, the home crowd's signature song was "<a href="The%20Happy%20Wanderer">The Happy Wanderer</a>", which was a chart hit in the U.K. in 1954 when Wolves first won the league title. In more recent times, "<a href="Hi%20Ho%20Silver%20Lining">Hi Ho Silver Lining</a>" – a 1967 rock song by <a href="Jeff%20Beck">Jeff Beck</a> with its chorus modified to "Hi Ho Wolverhampton!" – has become a staple feature of home games. "<a href="The%20Liquidator%20%28instrumental%29">The Liquidator</a>" instrumental by the <a href="Harry%20J.%20Allstars">Harry J. Allstars</a> was also popularly used in the stadium until a request from the <a href="West%20Midlands%20Police">West Midlands Police</a> to cease due to concerns that the obscene lyrics used by some fans during the chorus could incite trouble.
The club attracted a number of hooligans in the 1960s. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a <a href="hooligan%20firm">hooligan firm</a> named "The Subway Army" would often ambush fans in the <a href="Subway%20%28underpass%29">subway</a> adjacent to the ground. The group was gradually broken up and virtually ceased to exist due to a large number of arrests – many as part of the police's nationwide "Operation GROWTH" (or "Get Rid of Wolverhampton's Troublesome Hooligans") in the late 1980s.
The club invites interaction with its supporters and has a Fans' Parliament, at which independently selected candidates meet with club officials discuss issues relating to the club. An independent <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a> named "A Load of Bull" (ALOB), in part a reference to leading goalscorer <a href="Steve%20Bull">Steve Bull</a>, published supporters' views between 1989 and 2012.
Ownership and finances.
The club is owned by the Chinese conglomerate group <a href="Fosun%20International">Fosun International</a>, which purchased the parent company of the club, W.W. (1990) Ltd., on 21 July 2016 for a reported £45 million from previous owner <a href="Steve%20Morgan%20%28businessman%29">Steve Morgan</a> and his company Bridgemere Group. In the last published accounts of Wolves' group parent company (covering the 2018–19 Premier League season), a pre-tax profit of just under £20 million was recorded, with turnover for the year equalling £172.5m. £92.1 million was spent on staff wages and costs.
Like most football clubs, significant commercial income is generated from shirt sponsorship deals. Past shirt sponsorship deals were as follows: <a href="Tatung%20Company">Tatung</a> (1982–86), Benjamin Perry (1986), Staw Distribution (1986–88), <a href="Mander%20Brothers">Manders Paint & Ink</a> (1988–90), <a href="Goodyear%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Goodyear</a> (1990–2002), <a href="Doritos">Doritos</a> (2002–04), Chaucer Consulting (2004–09), <a href="Sportingbet">Sportingbet</a> (2009–13), <a href="What%20House%3F">What House?</a> (2013–15), Silverbug (2015–16), <a href="Dollar%20Financial%20Group">The Money Shop</a> (2016–18), W88 (2018–19). ManBetX (2019-2022) and <a href="AstroPay">AstroPay</a> (2022-).
Fosun bought Wolves from Steve Morgan, who had taken ownership in August 2007 for a nominal sum of £10 with the proviso that £30 million was injected into the club, ending an almost four-year search for a new buyer. Morgan oversaw nine full seasons, but placed the club on the market for new owners in September 2015. Morgan had bought the club from <a href="Jack%20Hayward">Sir Jack Hayward</a>, a lifelong fan of the club, who had himself purchased it in 1990 for £2.1 million. During his tenure Sir Jack invested an estimated £50 million of his personal wealth to rebuild the club's stadium and fund new players, but the team only achieved one season in the top flight during his 17 years at the helm despite this increased spending power.
Hayward's takeover greatly improved the club's financial health, after a turbulent 1980s in which the club twice was declared bankrupt. In 1982 the club was "saved" from liquidation when it was purchased by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti, as part of their company Allied Properties. However, their failure to sufficiently invest in the club saw it face several winding-up orders as well as successive relegations through the football divisions. In 1986 the <a href="Receivership">official receiver</a> was again called in and a deal eventually brokered for <a href="Wolverhampton%20City%20Council">Wolverhampton City Council</a> to purchase <a href="Molineux%20Stadium">the club's stadium</a> for £1.12 million, along with the surrounding land, while a local developer, Gallagher Estates, in conjunction with the <a href="Asda">Asda</a> supermarket chain, agreed to pay off the club's outstanding debts in return for the building of an Asda superstore on land adjacent to the stadium.
Honours.
In the all-time table since the league's inception in 1888, Wolves sit fourth in terms of points gathered in all divisions (as of the conclusion of the 2018–19 season), with only Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal having accumulated more points in total. Wolves were the first side to win all four divisions of the English professional game and have won every competition currently contested in English domestic football.

Records and statistics.
Individual records.
<a href="Derek%20Parkin">Derek Parkin</a> holds the record for the most first-team appearances, with 609 (501 of which were league appearances). Highest goalscorer was <a href="Steve%20Bull">Steve Bull</a> with 306 (including 250 league goals - including a record 52 in one season). <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a> was Wolves' most capped international, winning 105 England caps while with the club. Signed in August 2022 for £38 million, <a href="Matheus%20Nunes">Matheus Nunes</a> became Wolves' most expensive signing, and became Wolves' record transfer when sold for £53 million to Manchester City in September 2023.
League history.
Wolverhampton Wanderers was a founder member of the Football League in 1888. The 2023–24 season is Wolves' 125th in the Football League system. Wolves have spent 118 of their 124 completed seasons to date within the top two tiers of English football. Wolves played in the third tier on four occasions, each occasion lasting just one season; three of these seasons ended with promotion back to the second tier as Champions, and one ended in relegation to the fourth tier. The club has played two seasons in England's fourth tier (in the 1980s).

They competed in the <a href="North%20Eastern%20League">North Eastern League</a> and <a href="Midland%20Football%20League%20%281889%29">Midland League</a>, before gaining admittance to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1910. They were promoted out of the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in 1919–20 and went on to win the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in <a href="1922%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1922</a>, having been beaten finalists in <a href="1920%20FA%20Cup%20final">1920</a>. Under the management of <a href="Herbert%20Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a>, Huddersfield were crowned <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">league champions</a> in three successive seasons: 1923–24, 1924–25 and 1925–26. They played on the losing side in three more FA Cup finals: <a href="1928%20FA%20Cup%20final">1928</a>, <a href="1930%20FA%20Cup%20final">1930</a> and <a href="1938%20FA%20Cup%20final">1938</a>. They were relegated from the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> after 32 years in 1952, though secured an immediate promotion the following season. Relegated again in 1956, they won the Second Division title at the end of the 1969–70 season, though were relegated three times in four years by 1975.

They returned to the fourth tier in 2003 following a second relegation in three years. Huddersfield reached the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> with three successful play-off campaigns: from Division Three in <a href="2004%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20play-off%20final">2004</a>, from <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> in <a href="2012%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">2012</a>, and then from the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> in <a href="2017%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2017</a>.

History.
Early years and golden days (1908–1945).
The club was founded in 1908. The founders bought a site on <a href="Leeds%20Road">Leeds Road</a> for £500, and joined the <a href="North%20Eastern%20League">North Eastern League</a>. The following season they joined the <a href="Midland%20Football%20League%20%281889%29">Midland Football League</a> in order to reduce travelling costs. In an effort to gain entry into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a>, the club invited Scottish architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> to reconstruct Leeds Road. A 4,000-seat stand was to be constructed, and terracing was also planned, to provide an overall capacity of 34,000. After the plans went through, Huddersfield directors successfully applied to become members of the Football League in 1910, and development of Leeds Road began immediately. However, the development costs were too high, and attendances sunk below 7,000. Huddersfield went into liquidation in 1912, after which a new <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a> was formed to take over the club's assets.
Huddersfield Town were reportedly £25,000 in debt in 1919, and attendances fell to around 3,000. Chairman <a href="Hilton%20Crowther">John Hilton Crowther</a> planned to merge Town with newly formed <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> and to relocate to <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>. The reports galvanised supporters to start fundraising to stave off the move. Shares of £1 had been released, converting the club to a public ownership. After a month of acquiring funds and negotiations, the club stayed in Huddersfield. The team then reached the <a href="1920%20FA%20Cup%20final">1920 FA Cup final</a> and won <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> for the first time.
During their <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">first season</a> in the top flight, former <a href="Leeds%20City%20F.C.">Leeds City</a> <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a> <a href="Herbert%20Chapman">Herbert Chapman</a> was brought in (after Huddersfield helped him overturn his ban) as the new assistant to <a href="Ambrose%20Langley">Ambrose Langley</a>. Chapman replaced Langley in March 1921, and led the team to a 17th-place finish. In the summer of 1921, <a href="playmaker">playmaker</a> <a href="Clem%20Stephenson">Clem Stephenson</a> and the club's all-time top goal scorer <a href="George%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201903%29">George Brown</a> were acquired. Chapman's tactics were based upon the principles of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his <a href="Winger%20%28association%20football%29">wingers</a>. He is regarded as the first manager to successfully employ the counter-attack. Other progressive ideas included a disciplined fitness regime for the players, and the practice of reserve and <a href="Youth%20system">youth teams</a> playing the same style as the senior team. He employed a wide-ranging <a href="Scout%20%28sport%29">scouting</a> network to find the right players for his tactical system.
The team won their first ever major honour, the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, after <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> were beaten 1–0 in the <a href="1922%20FA%20Cup%20final">1922 FA Cup final</a>. Huddersfield also won the <a href="1922%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">1922 Charity Shield</a>, defeating <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> 1–0. Town finished in third place in <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1922–23</a>, before winning their first ever First Division championship in <a href="1923%E2%80%9324%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1923–24</a>. The team fought off <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a>, although it was by the narrowest of margins. They both finished on 57 points, but Huddersfield won it by a difference of 0.024 in <a href="Goal%20difference">goal average</a>. Huddersfield won 3–0 against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in the last match, and Cardiff drew 0–0 at <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> and missed a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a>.
The team retained their First Division title in <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1924–25</a> after only one loss in the last 27 league matches. Huddersfield only conceded 28 goals and never conceded more than two per game; the first time a team accomplished this feat. Another notable feat was achieved in October 1924, as <a href="Billy%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201895%29">Billy Smith</a> became the first player in history to score directly from a <a href="Corner%20kick">corner</a>. After winning successive league titles, Chapman left for <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, which offered to double his wages and attracted larger crowds than Huddersfield. <a href="Cecil%20Potter">Cecil Potter</a> was brought in as his successor. Under Potter, Town became the first club to win <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">three successive English League titles</a> in <a href="1925%E2%80%9326%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1925–26</a>. The team came close to winning a fourth consecutive title the <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">following season</a>, but only won one of their last seven matches and thus handed the title to <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. Town won the "wrong <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a>" in the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1927–28</a> season; they finished runners-up in both the league and lost the <a href="1928%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a>.
In March 1928, an international match between <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> and <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> featured five Town players. <a href="Tom%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201896%29">Tom Wilson</a>, <a href="Bob%20Kelly%20%28footballer%29">Bob Kelly</a>, Billy Smith, and <a href="Roy%20Goodall">Roy Goodall</a> started for England; <a href="Alex%20Jackson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201905%29">Alex Jackson</a> played for Scotland. Jackson scored a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> as Scotland, later nicknamed "The <a href="Wembley%20Wizards">Wembley Wizards</a>", defeated England 5–1.
Huddersfield's ageing squad was not adequately replaced. A deterioration of their league position followed, although they finished runners-up in <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1933–34</a>, and two more <a href="List%20of%20FA%20Cup%20Finals">FA Cup Finals</a> were reached under new manager Clem Stephenson. Town were defeated in <a href="1930%20FA%20Cup%20final">1930</a> by Chapman's Arsenal, and in <a href="1938%20FA%20Cup%20final">1938</a> by <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a>, which was the first FA Cup final to be broadcast on television. A record home attendance of 67,037 was achieved in 1932 during an FA Cup sixth round tie against Arsenal.
Decline and recovery (1945–1992).
Town were relegated for the first time in the <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1951–52</a> season. <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> manager <a href="Andy%20Beattie">Andy Beattie</a> was appointed in April 1952, and managed Stockport and Huddersfield in three divisions in the same month. He also had two horseshoes nailed to his office wall for luck. The team finished second in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1952–53</a> and made an immediate return. They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight. After Town were relegated in <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1955–56</a>, Beattie resigned as manager in November 1956, and <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a> succeeded him. In December 1957, the team led 5–1 with 30 minutes remaining against <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>, but lost <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.%207%E2%80%936%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">7–6</a>. Shankly left in December 1959 to manage <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>.
<a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">Floodlights</a> were installed at Leeds Road in 1961, which were financed by the British record transfer fee of £55,000 of <a href="Denis%20Law">Denis Law</a> to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, and became known as the "Denis Law Lights".
Huddersfield continued to play in the second tier during the 1960s. They reached the semi-final of the League Cup in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Football%20League%20Cup">1967–68</a>, but lost on aggregate to Arsenal. In 1969, the club adopted the nickname "The Terriers". Town won the Second Division in <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1969–70</a> under the guidance of <a href="Ian%20Greaves">Ian Greaves</a>. The team stayed up in their first season back in the first tier, but were relegated in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1971–72</a>, which was followed by another relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for the first time the season after. Huddersfield were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> for the first time in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1974–75</a>.
Former Town manager <a href="Tom%20Johnston%20%28footballer%29">Tom Johnston</a> returned to the club as <a href="general%20manager">general manager</a> in 1975. The club later returned to all-blue shirts that he had introduced in the mid-1960s. Johnston replaced <a href="Bobby%20Collins%20%28footballer%29">Bobby Collins</a> as manager in December 1975. During the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1976–77</a> season, <a href="John%20Haselden">John Haselden</a> became the manager with Johnston returning to his previous role. This, however, did not last, as Johnston demoted Haselden in September 1977 and gave himself the job. He managed Town to their lowest ever league position of 11th at the end of the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1977–78</a> season.
A recovery started under manager <a href="Mick%20Buxton">Mick Buxton</a>, who was appointed in 1978. Huddersfield won the Fourth Division in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1979–80</a>, scoring 101 goals in the process. Town finished just outside the promotion places the following season. The team won promotion to the Second Division in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1982–83</a> by a third-place finish. Due to Huddersfield languishing at the bottom of the division, declining home attendances, and the resulting financial pressure, Buxton was sacked in December 1986. <a href="Steve%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201946%29">Steve Smith</a> succeeded him, and became the first (and as of 2024, only) permanent manager in the club's history to hail from Huddersfield. The team stayed up by three points that season, but were relegated back to the third tier in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1987–88</a>. Town only won six matches, conceded 100 goals, and lost 10–1 against <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Huddersfield reached the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1991–92</a> <a href="EFL%20League%20One%20play-offs">Third Division play-offs</a>, but lost the semi-final against <a href="Peterborough%20United%20F.C.">Peterborough United</a> by an aggregate score of 4–3.
New stadium, near extinction, and a return to the top flight (1992–2019).
The team avoided relegation to the Third Division (renamed from the Fourth Division after the introduction of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>) in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1992–93</a>, following a run of only three defeats in their last 17 league games, to finish in 15th place. Manager <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a> took over from <a href="Ian%20Ross%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201947%29">Ian Ross</a> for the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">1993–94</a> season. Town reached the <a href="1994%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20final">1994 Football League Trophy final</a>, but lost against <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a> on <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a>.
Huddersfield Town played their final match at Leeds Road on 30 April 1994, beating <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> 2–1, which was watched by a near capacity crowd of 16,195. They moved into the new <a href="Kirklees%20Stadium">Kirklees Stadium</a> (then named as the <a href="Alfred%20McAlpine">Alfred McAlpine</a> Stadium) for the <a href="1994-95%20in%20English%20football">1994–95</a> season. During the first season at the new stadium, Huddersfield were promoted to the second tier via the play-offs after a <a href="1995%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20final">2–1</a> win against <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. Warnock left the club that summer, and was replaced by <a href="Brian%20Horton">Brian Horton</a>, who guided the Town to an eighth place finish the following season.
Horton was sacked in October 1997, with Huddersfield without a win in their first nine games. Former Huddersfield player <a href="Peter%20Jackson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201961%29">Peter Jackson</a> was given the job. They only scored one point in Jackson's first five games, but Huddersfield finally won in their 15th match, by beating <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> 3–1. Unbeaten runs mixed with winless runs followed, and Town managed to stay up by a 16th-place finish.
In January 1999, the club was bought by local businessman Barry Rubery, who targeted to reach the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> succeeded Jackson in May 1999. Huddersfield topped the table in December, but their form plummeted after striker <a href="Marcus%20Stewart">Marcus Stewart</a> was sold in the January <a href="transfer%20window">transfer window</a> to First Division rivals <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. They finished the season in eighth place, just outside the <a href="EFL%20Championship%20play-offs">play-offs</a>. Bruce was sacked in October 2000. Rubery accused Bruce of "wasting £3 million", arguing that the money would have been "spent more wisely by a more experienced manager without an ego to feed". He was replaced by <a href="Lou%20Macari">Lou Macari</a>, who was unable to halt the slide as relegation to the third tier followed at the end of the season. Huddersfield reached the play-offs in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">2001–02</a>, but lost 2–1 to <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> in the semi-final.
Around this time, the club had debts of 20 million pounds following relegation and the collapse of <a href="ITV%20Digital">ITV Digital</a>. The players went months without being paid, and manager <a href="Mick%20Wadsworth">Mick Wadsworth</a> was sacked in January 2003, only to be reinstated because the club did not have any money for his pay-off. Wadsworth was eventually sacked in March and replaced by <a href="Mel%20Machin">Mel Machin</a>, who oversaw relegation to the fourth tier. The club was put into <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>, but <a href="Ken%20Davy">Ken Davy</a> bought the club in the summer of 2003 and rescued Town from liquidation. Manager Peter Jackson only had four senior players on the books before the beginning of the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">2003–04</a> season, after which many youngsters from the academy setup were added. Huddersfield finished in a surprising fourth place, and defeated <a href="Mansfield%20Town%20F.C.">Mansfield Town</a> in the <a href="2004%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a> to return to the third tier.
The team reached the play-offs in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">2005–06</a>, but were eliminated by <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> in the semi-final, after further seasons in <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> followed. <a href="Dean%20Hoyle">Dean Hoyle</a> took over as chairman, and majority <a href="shareholder">shareholder</a>, of the club in June 2009. Town reached the play-offs in <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">2009–10</a> under manager <a href="Lee%20Clark%20%28footballer%29">Lee Clark</a>, but lost against <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> in the semi-final. The team again qualified for the play-offs the following season, however, Peterborough United were victorious in the <a href="2011%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">final</a>. Huddersfield set a Football League record of 43 matches unbeaten (not including the play-off matches), which was previously set by Nottingham Forest, in November 2011. Clark was sacked in February 2012 following a 1–0 home defeat to <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, and was replaced by former Leeds United manager <a href="Simon%20Grayson">Simon Grayson</a>. He led Town to the <a href="2012%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a> against Sheffield United. The game finished 0–0 after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a>, before Huddersfield were victorious after 22 penalties (8–7).
Despite this success, Grayson was sacked in January 2013, being succeeded by <a href="Mark%20Robins">Mark Robins</a>. Huddersfield avoided relegation on the last day, after a draw with Barnsley. German <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund%20II">Borussia Dortmund II</a> coach <a href="David%20Wagner%20%28soccer%29">David Wagner</a> became the first person born outside the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> to manage the club in November 2015. He implemented the ""<a href="Gegenpressing">Gegenpressing</a>"" style of play. In <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">2016–17</a>, Town finished fifth with a negative goal difference, and qualified for the play-offs. After defeating <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> on penalties in the semi-final, they faced <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> in the <a href="2017%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">final</a>. Another penalty shoot-out followed, and Huddersfield were again victorious. Promotion to the Premier League meant a return to the first tier for the first time since 1972. Huddersfield also became the second club, after Blackpool, to have won all three divisional play-offs.
The team finished 16th in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in the 2017–18 season and stayed up, but were relegated after a 20th-place finish in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.%20season">2018–19</a>. Wagner left the club by mutual consent in January 2019, and was replaced by Borussia Dortmund II manager <a href="Jan%20Siewert">Jan Siewert</a>, but Town were relegated in March with six matches remaining. The team amassed only three wins and 16 points by the end of the season.
Championship years and two new owners (2019–present).
Chairman Hoyle announced his departure in May 2019, selling the club to businessman Phil Hodgkinson, relinquishing the post due to poor health. Siewert was replaced by <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a> manager <a href="Danny%20Cowley">Danny Cowley</a> in September of that year, who guided the club to survival in the Championship before being sacked. Leeds United assistant coach <a href="Carlos%20Corber%C3%A1n">Carlos Corberán</a> was appointed as the club's new head coach in July 2020.
Huddersfield finished third in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a> and met fourth placed Nottingham Forest in the <a href="2022%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2022 EFL Championship play-off final</a> at Wembley, losing 1–0; Town were denied two penalty claims by <a href="Referee%20%28association%20football%29">referee</a> <a href="Jonathan%20Moss%20%28referee%29">Jonathan Moss</a> in his last game before retirement. In the first instance, the <a href="video%20assistant%20referee">video assistant referee</a> did not overturn Moss's decision despite apparent contact between Forest's <a href="Jack%20Colback">Jack Colback</a> and Huddersfield's <a href="Harry%20Toffolo">Harry Toffolo</a>.
Corberán left in July 2022, shortly before the 2022–23 Championship season, and joined <a href="Olympiacos%20F.C.">Olympiacos</a> in Greece. Former Town player <a href="Danny%20Schofield">Danny Schofield</a> was appointed as the new head coach, but was dismissed 10 weeks later after a poor start to the new season, to be replaced by <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> assistant coach <a href="Mark%20Fotheringham%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29">Mark Fotheringham</a>. He lasted only four months and was sacked on 8 February 2023, being replaced by <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a> five days later. His return to the John Smiths stadium saw a 2–1 win against Birmingham on 18 February 2023 and he was quoted as saying he had 'tears in his eyes' due to the reception he received from the fans.
On 23 March 2023, Huddersfield announced the club's takeover by an unnamed North American group after Dean Hoyle, who returned to the club in 2020, acquired 100% of its shares and then sold them. The deal was subject to "legislative and governance procedures", and involved Hoyle writing off £40 million of debt to keep the club, sitting 22nd in the Championship, out of administration. On 28 March 2023, the club revealed the bid was from American investor and owner of <a href="USL%20Championship">USL Championship</a> side <a href="Sacramento%20Republic%20FC">Sacramento Republic</a>, <a href="Kevin%20M.%20Nagle">Kevin M. Nagle</a>; the deal was completed in June 2023.
A six-point deduction for <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> for breaching profitability and sustainability rules allowed Huddersfield to avoid relegation to League One. A 1–0 home victory against already-promoted <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> on 4 May 2023 confirmed Huddersfield's safety. However, Huddersfield continued to struggle in the 2023–24 season, parting company with Warnock in September 2023, then appointing <a href="Darren%20Moore">Darren Moore</a> as manager, but sacking him in January 2024, after just three wins in 23 matches, with the club 21st in the second tier and three points above the relegation places.
Badge and colours.
The club spent over eight years debating what colour the <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a> should be, with suggestions ranging from <a href="salmon%20pink">salmon pink</a> to plain white or all-blue to white with blue <a href="yoke">yoke</a>. Eventually, in 1916, the club adopted the striped blue and white jersey that remains to this day.
The club badge is based on the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of Huddersfield. Town first used a badge on its shirts for the 1920 FA Cup Final based on the Huddersfield coat of arms. It appeared again with a <a href="Yorkshire%20Rose">Yorkshire Rose</a> for the 1922 FA Cup Final and again for the finals of 1928, 1930 and 1938. The club's main colours of blue and white are evident throughout the badge both in the <a href="mantling">mantling</a> and in the shield, in the form of stripes. Two Yorkshire Roses and <a href="Castle%20Hill%2C%20Huddersfield">Castle Hill</a> form part of the history of the club and the area.
Town stuck with the same principal design (blue and white stripes) until 1966, when Scottish manager Tom Johnston introduced all-blue shirts. A new badge was also adopted that year, when the vertical <a href="monogram">monogram</a> "HTFC" adorned the all-blue shirts. When the club adopted the nickname "The <a href="Yorkshire%20Terrier">Terriers</a>" for the 1969–70 season, the blue and white stripes returned and with it a red terrier with the words "The Terriers".
After relegation to the Fourth Division, Huddersfield returned to all-blue shirts and the vertical monogram crest with the return of Tom Johnston in 1975. Stripes returned in the 1977–78 season and have been the club's home kit ever since. In 1980, Town adopted what remains their badge today. It combined elements of the old town coat of arms with modern motifs, such as blue and white stripes and a terrier with a football.
In 2000, Huddersfield changed its badge to a circular design, but that was never popular with the fans, and soon returned to the heraldic-style badge. The badge was further redeveloped with a small adaptation in 2005. The club took the decision to remove "A.F.C." from the text, leaving only the wording "Huddersfield Town". This eased problems with embroidery on shirts and club merchandise, and also gave the printwork a standard look.
The club adopted a Terriers logo in 2018. It was used solely on the strip and did not replace the heraldic crest, which continued to appear on all official media and documents. In 2019, Town agreed to have <a href="Paddy%20Power">Paddy Power</a> shirt sponsorship in a striking beauty queen style diagonal sash design. Within days, the club were contacted by <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> for their "observations" about the kit. Shortly after, it was revealed that the shirt was a <a href="Practical%20joke">prank</a> envisioned by Paddy Power, and that the club would play in shirts without a sponsor. as part of their "Save Our Shirt" campaign.
Huddersfield returned to a updated version of their heraldic-style crest in 2019. The three stars (representing their hat-trick of league titles in the 1920s) were moved inside the shield. Furthermore, a single Yorkshire Rose was placed at the top of the blue and white stripes, above the three stars. The shield was also modernized by moving away from the more rounded version. The Terrier was incorporated into the crest, at the top of the shield, and the club's founding date was introduced on either side of Castle Hill.

Supporters and rivalries.
Since 1920, Huddersfield's club song has been "Smile A While". The anthem was created by G. W. Chappell of <a href="Longwood%2C%20Huddersfield">Longwood, Huddersfield</a>, before the 1920 FA Cup Final against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. It was an adapted version of the popular First World War song "<a href="Till%20We%20Meet%20Again%20%281918%20song%29">Till We Meet Again</a>". Chappell's creation was originally called "The Town Anthem", and was sung by Town supporters ahead of the Final. The anthem is still sung by Huddersfield supporters at home matches.
In 2014, a group of Town fans formed a collective called "North Stand Loyal". Its aim was "to improve the atmosphere around the stadium on matchdays", and the members were "inspired by fan groups of continental Europe and other parts of the world". In 2017, the group renamed themselves "Cowshed Loyal". The group is located in the South Stand, which is shared with away fans.
The club also has various overseas <a href="supporters%27%20groups">supporters' groups</a>, with clubs in Australia, Canada, Northern Ireland, Norway, Republic of Ireland, Singapore, Slovakia, and United States.

The club were founder members of the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28football%29">Lancashire League</a> in 1889 and were invited into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a> in 1896. They failed re-election in 1899 but had their Football League membership reinstated the following year. Blackpool remained in the Second Division until they won the league title in 1929–30, though they were relegated after three seasons in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>. Promoted again in 1936–37, the club entered a golden period under the stewardship of long-time manager <a href="Joe%20Smith%20%28football%20forward%2C%20born%201889%29">Joe Smith</a>. Blackpool lost the <a href="1948%20FA%20Cup%20final">1948</a> and <a href="1951%20FA%20Cup%20final">1951</a> FA Cup finals before winning the competition in <a href="1953%20FA%20Cup%20final">1953</a>, in the so-called "<a href="Stanley%20Matthews">Matthews</a> final", in which they beat <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> 4–3, overturning a 3–1 deficit in the closing stages of the game. That same year, four Blackpool players were in the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England team</a> which lost against <a href="England%20v%20Hungary%20%281953%29">Hungary</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. In the 1950s they had four top-six finishes in the First Division, with their best position being runners-up to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in 1955–56. In 1956, Stanley Matthews was the inaugural recipient of the <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or">Ballon d'Or</a>.
Blackpool were relegated out of the First Division in 1967 and again in 1971 after winning promotion in 1969–70. They dropped into the fourth tier after suffering relegations in 1978 and 1981, then gained promotion in 1984–85. Between 1987 and 2019, the club was owned by the Oyston family. Nine years after buying the club, <a href="Owen%20Oyston">Owen Oyston</a> was jailed for the 1992 rape and indecent assault of a 16-year-old girl. His wife, Vicki, took over the chairmanship of the club during her husband's three-year prison term. The couple's son, <a href="Karl%20Oyston">Karl</a>, took over in 1999 and remained in the role for 19 years. In 2018, after the Oyston family was found, in a <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> judgement, to have operated an "illegitimate stripping" of the club, paying out £26.77 million to companies they owned, Owen relieved Karl of his role and gave it to his daughter, Natalie. In June 2019, <a href="Simon%20Sadler%20%28businessman%29">Simon Sadler</a>, a 49-year-old Blackpool-born businessman, bought a 96.2% share in the club, completely removing the Oyston family from any involvement.
During the long years of Oyston ownership, Blackpool were relegated into the fourth tier in 1990, promoted via the play-offs in <a href="1992%20Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division%20play-off%20final">1992</a>, then relegated again in 2000. Blackpool reached the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 2010, after becoming the first club to gain promotion from every division of the Football League via the play-off system; they won the <a href="2001%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20play-off%20final">2001 Third Division play-offs</a>, <a href="2007%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">2007 League One play-offs</a> and the <a href="2010%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2010 Championship play-offs</a>. They spent one season in the Premier League, under manager <a href="Ian%20Holloway">Ian Holloway</a>, and later suffered a double relegation into <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> by 2016, though gained immediate promotion by winning the <a href="2017%20EFL%20League%20Two%20play-off%20final">2017 League Two play-off final</a> – their sixth success in the format in eight finals.
History.
Formation and early years (1877–1900).
Football had developed in Blackpool by 1877, when Victoria F.C. were founded as a church club with a ground in Caunce Street. This team disbanded a few years later but some of its members are understood to have <a href="mergers%20and%20acquisitions">merged</a> with old boys from St John's School to form a new club called Blackpool St John's. The two factions remained disunited, however, and on 26 July 1887, at a meeting in the Stanley Arms public house, the members resolved to wind up St John's and form a new club to represent the whole town. It was named Blackpool Football Club.
The new club managed to win two pieces of silverware in its first season in existence, <a href="1887%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football">1887–88</a>: the <a href="The%20Fylde">Fylde</a> Cup and the <a href="Lancashire%20Junior%20Cup">Lancashire Junior Cup</a>.
At the conclusion of the following <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1888–89</a> season, Blackpool became founder members of the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28football%29">Lancashire League</a>. In their first season in the competition, the club finished fifth out of the 13 member clubs. They finished as runners-up over the following three seasons (to <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a> twice and <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> once), before winning the championship themselves on their fourth attempt.
Blackpool's home at that point in time was <a href="Raikes%20Hall">Raikes Hall</a> (also known as the Royal Palace Gardens), which was part of a large entertainment complex that included a theatre and a boating lake, amongst other attractions. This meant that the club's average attendances were around the 2,000 mark, making the club's formative years a financial success.
After struggling to repeat the success of the 1893–94 season, the Blackpool board decided it was time to leave local football behind, so on 13 May 1896 the club became a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a> and applied for entry to the <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a>.
Their application was successful, and for the club's debut season, <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201896-97">1896–97</a>, they joined the 16-team <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. Blackpool's first-ever Football League game took place on 5 September 1896, at <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a>, which they lost 3–1 in front of around 1,500 spectators.
For the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201897-98">1897–98</a> campaign, the club played their home games at the <a href="Athletic%20Grounds%20%28Blackpool%29">Athletic Grounds</a> (at the present-day <a href="Stanley%20Park%2C%20Blackpool">Stanley Park</a>). They remained there for the first seven home games of <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201898-99">1898–99</a>, before returning to Raikes Hall for the remaining 10.
After finishing third-bottom, the club were not re-elected at the end of the 1898–99 season, and spent the <a href="1899-1900%20in%20English%20football">1899–1900</a> term back in the Lancashire League. They finished third, and after the Football League's annual meeting, on 25 May 1900, were permitted back into Division Two. It was during this season out of the League that Blackpool amalgamated with local rivals South Shore and moved to <a href="Bloomfield%20Road">Bloomfield Road</a>.
Early 20th century (1900–1946).
During the 10 seasons that followed, Blackpool could finish no higher than 12th place. The club's top goalscorers in the league included <a href="Bob%20Birket">Bob Birket</a> (10 goals in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201900-01">1900–01</a>), <a href="Geordie%20Anderson">Geordie Anderson</a> (12 goals in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201901-02">1901–02</a>) and <a href="Bob%20Whittingham">Bob Whittingham</a> (13 in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201908-09">1908–09</a>).
At the end of <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201910-11">1910–11</a>, the club found themselves in seventh place, thanks largely to <a href="Joe%20Clennell">Joe Clennell</a>'s haul of 18 goals.
It was a case of "as you were", however, for the four seasons leading up to the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, with finishing positions of 14th, 20th, 16th and 10th. For the last of those seasons, <a href="Joe%20Lane%20%28footballer%29">Joe Lane</a> netted 28 goals.
The outbreak of war forced the cancellation of League football for four years, during which time regional competitions were introduced. When normality resumed, in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201919-20">1919–20</a>, Blackpool had appointed their first full-time manager in the form of <a href="Bill%20Norman%20%28football%20manager%29">Bill Norman</a>. Norman guided the club to fourth-placed finishes in his first two league seasons in charge (he was installed as manager during the final inter-war season), with Lane again netting close to 30 goals in the former.
The club's form nosedived in the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201921-22">1921–22</a> season, with a finishing position of 19th, before bouncing back to a fifth-placed finish the following campaign. <a href="Harry%20Bedford%20%28footballer%29">Harry Bedford</a>, who had joined the club from <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, was the country's top league scorer, with 32 goals to his name.
Bedford repeated the feat the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201923-24">following season</a>, this time under the watchful eye of new manager <a href="Frank%20Buckley%20%28footballer%29">Frank Buckley</a>, who replaced Bill Norman after his four years of service. Blackpool finished fourth in Buckley's first season in charge.
The <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201924-25">1924–25</a> season was not as successful; a 17th-placed finish tempered only slightly by the club's reaching the fourth round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time. A single-goal defeat at fellow Lancastrians <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> ended "the Seasiders"' run.
Buckley guided Blackpool to top-10 finishes in his final two seasons as manager – with <a href="Billy%20Tremelling">Billy Tremelling</a>'s 30 goals in the latter helping considerably – before he left to take the helm at <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>.
Buckley's replacement was <a href="Sydney%20Beaumont">Sydney Beaumont</a>, who took charge for the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201927-28">1927–28</a> season, but he lasted only until the spring after the club finished in 19th position.
<a href="Harry%20Evans%20%28football%20manager%29">Harry Evans</a> was installed as the new Blackpool manager, in an honorary capacity, for the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201928-29">1928–29</a> campaign. Due in no small part to <a href="Jimmy%20Hampson">Jimmy Hampson</a>'s 40 goals, the club finished eighth. In his <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201929-30">second season</a>, Evans guided Blackpool to the Division Two championship (their only championship to date), finishing ahead of promotion rivals <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a> by three and four points respectively. Hampson had bagged 45 of the club's 98 league goals.
Blackpool lasted only three seasons in the First Division. Two third-bottom finishes were followed by a last-placed finish, and the club returned to the Second Division.
The club's relegation prompted the Blackpool board to install a recognised manager, and they opted for <a href="Alex%20%27Sandy%27%20MacFarlane">Sandy MacFarlane</a>. MacFarlane occupied the <a href="Bloomfield%20Road">Bloomfield Road</a> hot seat for just two seasons, in which the club finished 11th and fourth. MacFarlane's final season, <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201934-35">1934–35</a>, marked Jimmy Hampson's eighth successive (and final) season as Blackpool's top League goalscorer.
<a href="Joe%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%201889%E2%80%931971%29">Joe Smith</a> was appointed Blackpool's sixth manager in August 1935, a role in which he remained for the next 23 years.
The club finished 10th in Smith's first season, with <a href="Bobby%20Finan">Bobby Finan</a> taking over from Hampson as top scorer, with 34 goals. It was Smith's second season in charge, however, that marked the starting point of the success to come. Blackpool finished the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201936-37">1936–37</a> season as runners-up in the Second Division to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> and were promoted back to the First Division.
Two seasons of Division One football were played before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> intervened. Blackpool sat atop the table at the time the abandonment occurred. Regional competitions were implemented again between 1939 and 1945. For the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201945-46">1945–46</a> season, after the war's conclusion, Blackpool spent one season in the <a href="Football%20League%20North%20and%20South">Football League North</a>.
Post-Second World War (1946–1967).
Scottish defender <a href="Hughie%20Kelly">Hugh Kelly</a> had arrived at Blackpool in 1943, as had fellow defender <a href="Tommy%20Garrett%20%28footballer%29">Tommy Garrett</a> in 1942. <a href="Striker%20%28association%20football%29">Forward</a> <a href="Stan%20Mortensen">Stan Mortensen</a> joined the club after the war in 1946. Mortensen went on to become Blackpool's top League goalscorer for the next nine seasons, sharing the honour with <a href="Allan%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201926%29">Allan Brown</a> in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201952-53">1952–53</a>. <a href="Stanley%20Matthews">Stanley Matthews</a>, who became a regular source of goals for Mortensen, joined Blackpool in 1947, as did centre-forward <a href="Jackie%20Mudie">Jackie Mudie</a>. Goalkeeper <a href="George%20Farm">George Farm</a> signed in 1948, followed by outside-left <a href="Bill%20Perry%20%28footballer%29">Bill Perry</a> in 1949. Kelly, Garrett, Matthews, Mudie, Farm and Perry would play with the club throughout the 1950s, the most successful decade in the club's history.
Post-war Blackpool reached the <a href="FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> on three occasions, losing to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in <a href="FA%20Cup%20final%201948">1948</a> and <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> <a href="FA%20Cup%20final%201951">three years later</a>, and winning it in <a href="FA%20Cup%20final%201953">1953</a>, captained by <a href="Harry%20Johnston%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201919%29">Harry Johnston</a>.
For the first and only time in the club's history, four Blackpool players (Johnston, Matthews, Mortensen and debutant <a href="Ernie%20Taylor%20%28footballer%20born%201925%29">Ernie Taylor</a>) represented <a href="England%20National%20Football%20Team">England</a> in the infamous <a href="1953%20England%20vs%20Hungary%20football%20match">6–3 defeat</a> by <a href="Hungary%20national%20football%20team">Hungary</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> on 25 November 1953. Of the four, only Matthews would ever represent his country again.
In <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201955-56">1955–56</a>, and now captained by Kelly, Blackpool attained their highest-ever finish in the Football League: runners-up to Manchester United, despite losing their final four league games. It was a feat that could not be matched or bettered over the following two seasons, with fourth and seventh-placed finishes, and Smith left Blackpool as the club's most successful and longest-serving manager.
Smith was succeeded, in May 1958, by <a href="Ron%20Suart">Ron Suart</a>, the first former "Tangerine" to return to the club as manager. In his first season, he led the club to eighth in the First Division and the sixth round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. A 23-year-old <a href="Ray%20Charnley">Ray Charnley</a> topped the club's goalscoring chart with 20, in his first season as a professional, and went on to repeat the feat for seven of the eight seasons that followed.
The <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> came into existence in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a>. Blackpool were knocked out in the second round, the round in which they entered. The club's First Division status came under threat, but they managed to avoid relegation by one point, at the expense of <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. Local arch-rivals <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> were the other club to make the drop.
In October 1961, Matthews, now aged 46, was sold back to <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a>. Mid-table finishes in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201961-62">1961–62</a> and <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201962-63">1962–63</a> (and an appearance in the League Cup semi-finals during the former) were offset by another lowly finish of 18th in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201963-64">1963–64</a>, with <a href="Alan%20Ball%20Jr.">Alan Ball</a> top-scoring with 13 goals. Much of the same ensued over the following two seasons, before relegation finally occurred in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201966-67">1966–67</a>. Blackpool finished bottom of the table, eight points adrift of fellow demotion victims <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. Suart had resigned four months before the end of the season. His replacement was another former Blackpool player, <a href="Stan%20Mortensen">Stan Mortensen</a>.
Late 20th century (1967–2000).
Mortensen picked up the pieces for the club's first season back in the Second Division in 30 years, guiding them to a <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201967-68">third-placed finish</a>. They had gone into the final game of the season at <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> knowing that a win would likely secure a return to the First Division. They won 3–1, but once the premature celebrations had ended, they discovered that their nearest rivals, <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>, had scored a last-minute winner at <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. Q.P.R. were promoted by virtue of a better goal-average: 1.86, to Blackpool's 1.65.
At the end of the following <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201968-69">1968–69</a> campaign, the Blackpool board made the decision to sack Mortensen after just over two years in the job. Their decision was met by fans with shock and anger, as Mortensen was as popular a manager as he was a player.
<a href="Les%20Shannon">Les Shannon</a>, who spent the majority of his playing career with Blackpool's Lancashire rivals <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>, was installed as manager for the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201969-70">1969–70</a> season. In his first season, he succeeded where Mortensen had failed, by guiding the club back to the top flight as runners-up behind <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>. Their promotion had been sealed after the penultimate game of the season, a 3–0 victory at rivals Preston North End, courtesy of a <a href="Fred%20Pickering">Fred Pickering</a> <a href="Hat-trick%23Association%20football">hat-trick</a>. The result effectively relegated the hosts to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>.
As quickly as Shannon had taken Blackpool up, he saw them return whence they came. The club finished at the foot of the table and were relegated back to Division Two, along with Burnley. Before the season's conclusion, Shannon was briefly replaced by <a href="Jimmy%20Meadows">Jimmy Meadows</a> as <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker manager</a>, who in turn was permanently replaced by <a href="Bob%20Stokoe">Bob Stokoe</a>. On 12 June 1971, well over a month after the conclusion of the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201970-71">League season</a>, Blackpool won the <a href="Anglo-Italian%20Cup">Anglo-Italian Cup</a> with a 2–1 victory over <a href="Bologna%20F.C.%201909">Bologna</a> in the final. This was achieved without the services of <a href="Jimmy%20Armfield">Jimmy Armfield</a>, who retired in May after 17 years and 627 appearances for the club.
Blackpool finished amongst the top 10 teams in the Second Division for six consecutive seasons, under three different managers: Stokoe, <a href="Harry%20Potts">Harry Potts</a> and <a href="Allan%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201926%29">Allan Brown</a>. Twice Blackpool narrowly missed promotion to Division One, by two points in 1974 and 1977.
In February 1978, midway through <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201977-78">1977–78</a>, Brown's second season at the helm, Blackpool were seventh in the division. Having just beaten local rivals Blackburn Rovers 5–2, on 6 February 1978, Brown was sacked by chairman Billy Cartmell for personal reasons. The team won only one more game that season, which ended with their relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three</a> for the first time in their history.
On 1 April 1978, with six games to go, Blackpool were in eighth place, nine points off the third relegation slot. On 25 April, with one game to go, Blackpool were 14th, three points above Cardiff City in the third relegation slot. Four days later, Blackpool completed their programme and were 16th with 37 points – two points clear of Leyton Orient in the third relegation slot, with a vastly superior goal difference (−1, which was four better than fifth-placed Blackburn Rovers). At that point, all the teams below Blackpool still had games to play, apart from bottom placed Hull City. The bottom of the Division Two table read:
The only other team in the division with games to play was Notts County, in 14th place with 38 points.
After Millwall achieved safety by beating already-relegated Mansfield Town, the three remaining fixtures were Cardiff City v. Notts County, Leyton Orient v. Charlton Athletic, and Cardiff City v. Leyton Orient. Only one combination from the 27 possible outcomes of those three games would have resulted in all three teams getting more than 37 points and Blackpool being relegated. Inevitably, Cardiff City beat Notts County, Leyton Orient drew with Charlton and, in the final match, Leyton Orient, who up to that point had only won one away game all season, and had lost six out of their previous eight away games, with no wins, beat now-safe Cardiff City, who had lost only two home games all season and had won six out of their previous seven homes games, with no defeats. Blackpool were relegated with 37 points (the seven teams above them all having 38 ), and were not to return to the second tier for 29 years:
Bob Stokoe returned for a second stint as manager for the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201978-79">1978–79</a> campaign, at the end of which Blackpool finished mid-table. Stokoe resigned during the summer.
<a href="Stan%20Ternent">Stan Ternent</a> became Blackpool's seventh manager in nine years, only to be replaced in February 1980 by <a href="Alan%20Ball%20Jr.">Alan Ball</a>, the popular former Blackpool midfielder who left the club for <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> 14 years earlier. Ball himself only lasted a year in the job, and departed when the club were relegated to the League's <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">basement division</a>.
Allan Brown had taken over from Ball in February 1981, and he remained in charge for the following <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201981-82">1981–82</a> term. Blackpool finished twelfth in their first season in Division Four; however, unable to handle the pressure of the job, Brown resigned during the close season.
<a href="Sam%20Ellis%20%28footballer%29">Sam Ellis</a> took over from Brown in June 1982, three years after he finished his playing career with <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>. His first season saw Blackpool finish 21st, with <a href="Dave%20Bamber">Dave Bamber</a> topping the club's goalscoring chart for the second consecutive season with 10 strikes.
It was <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201984-85">Ellis's third season</a>, however, that brought the success the club had been looking for. Blackpool finished second behind <a href="Chesterfield%20F.C.">Chesterfield</a> and were back in Division Three.
The club managed to finish in the top half of the table for their first three seasons in the Third Division, but slipped to 19th in Ellis's seventh and final season in charge.
On 17 April 1986, the board of directors put the club on the market after councillors rejected plans to sell Bloomfield Road for a supermarket site in a £35 million redevelopment scheme. The club was then sold to <a href="Owen%20Oyston">Owen Oyston</a> for £1.
For the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201989-90">1989–90</a> season, Blackpool appointed <a href="Jimmy%20Mullen%20%28footballer%20born%201952%29">Jimmy Mullen</a> as manager. Mullen's reign last only 11 months, however, and he left the club after their relegation back to Division Four.
<a href="Graham%20Carr">Graham Carr</a> replaced Mullen, but his spell in the manager's seat was even shorter – just four months. He was sacked in November 1990 with Blackpool in 18th place.
Carr's replacement was his assistant, <a href="Billy%20Ayre">Billy Ayre</a>. Ayre guided the team to a fifth-placed finish and qualification for the <a href="Football%20League%20play-offs">play-offs</a>. They lost only five of their 30 league games that remained at the time of Ayre's appointment. The run included 13 consecutive home league wins in an eventual 24–game unbeaten run at <a href="Bloomfield%20Road">Bloomfield Road</a>. The run was extended to 15 consecutive home wins at the start of the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201991%E2%80%9392">1991–92</a> campaign, which remains the club record.
After beating <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a> in the two-legged semi-finals of the play-offs, Blackpool <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201990-91%23Final">lost</a> to <a href="Torquay%20United%20F.C.">Torquay United</a> in the <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> final, on penalties after the score was tied 2–2 after regular and extra time.
The following <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201991-92">1991–92</a> season finished with Blackpool in fourth place, missing out on automatic promotion by one point, which meant another play-offs experience. This time they met <a href="Barnet%20F.C.">Barnet</a> in the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201991-92%23Semi-finals">semi-finals</a> and won 2–1 on aggregate. They returned to Wembley, where they faced Scunthorpe United <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201991-92%23Final">in the final</a>, the team they knocked out of the play-offs 12 months earlier. Again the score was tied at the end of regular and extra time, but Blackpool were victorious in the penalty shootout and booked their place in the new Division Two.
Blackpool struggled in their first term back in the third tier of English football but pulled to safety in 18th place by the end. In late 1993 they were as high as fourth but tumbled down the table in the second half of that season to miss the drop by a whisker in 20th, avoiding relegation by virtue of a 4–1 victory over <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a> on the final day of the season. Ayre was sacked in the summer of 1994 and was replaced by <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a>.
Allardyce led Blackpool to a mid-table finish in his <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201994-95">first season</a> and saw the club knocked out of both cup competitions at the first hurdle. <a href="Tony%20Ellis">Tony Ellis</a> was the club's top scorer with 17 league goals.
The <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201995-96">1995–96</a> season saw Blackpool finish third and claim a place in the play-offs for the third time in six seasons. In the semi-finals, Blackpool travelled to <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a> and won 2–0. Three days later, they hosted the Yorkshiremen at Bloomfield Road and lost 3–0. Blackpool remained in Division Two, and Allardyce was sacked not long afterwards.
In 1996, owner Oyston <a href="Owen%20Oyston%23Rape%20case">was convicted of the rape</a> of a 16-year-old girl.
Former <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> manager <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a> replaced Allardyce, and attained a seventh-placed finish in his <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201996-97">only season in charge</a>. <a href="Nigel%20Worthington">Nigel Worthington</a> succeeded Megson in the summer of 1997, and in the <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Irishman</a>'s two full campaigns in the hot seat, Blackpool finished 12th and 14th. Worthington resigned towards the end of the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201999-2000">1999–2000</a> season, and his seat was filled by the former <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> midfielder <a href="Steve%20McMahon%20%28footballer%29">Steve McMahon</a>.
Rise to the Premier League (2001–2010).
McMahon arrived too late to save the club from relegation to the Third Division (fourth tier) after a 22nd-placed finish in the table. In his <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%202000-01">first full season</a> in charge, Blackpool were promoted to <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Two">Division Two</a> by winning the play-offs. The <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%202001-02">following season</a> the club received its then record outgoing transfer fee; £1.75million from <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> for <a href="Brett%20Ormerod">Brett Ormerod</a>, eclipsing the £600,000 <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">QPR</a> paid for <a href="Trevor%20Sinclair">Trevor Sinclair</a> eight years earlier. They also gained the first of two <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> wins in 2002 as Blackpool beat <a href="Cambridge%20United%20F.C.">Cambridge United</a> 4–1 at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a>. Their second win was in 2004, this time beating <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a> 2–0 again in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. In the summer following the Trophy win, McMahon resigned, believing he could not take the club any further with the budget he was being offered. <a href="Colin%20Hendry">Colin Hendry</a> became the new manager, but was replaced by <a href="Simon%20Grayson">Simon Grayson</a> in November 2005 after an unsuccessful stint which left Blackpool languishing just above the relegation zone of League One (third tier).
In the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20FA%20Cup">2006–07 FA Cup</a> Blackpool reached the fourth round for the first time in 17 years, after beating <a href="Aldershot%20Town%20F.C.">Aldershot Town</a> 4–2 at <a href="Bloomfield%20Road">Bloomfield Road</a>, but were knocked out by <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>, 3–2 after a replay at <a href="Carrow%20Road">Carrow Road</a>. They finished in third place, and qualified for the play-offs, and as top scorers in League One with 76 goals. After beating <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a> 5–2 on aggregate in the semi-final they met <a href="Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.">Yeovil Town</a> in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%202006-07%23Final">the final</a> at the new <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, their first appearance at <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>'s national stadium in 15 years. Blackpool won 2–0, a club-record 10th consecutive victory, and were promoted to <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">the Championship</a> in their 100th overall season in the Football League. The promotion marked their return to English football's second tier for the first time in 29 years.
Blackpool knocked <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> side <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> out of the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> at the second-round stage on 28 August 2007. The match ended 1–1 after 90 minutes and 2–2 after extra time. The Seasiders won the resulting penalty shootout 7–6. On 25 September, Blackpool beat <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a> 2–1 after extra time to reach the fourth round for the first time in 35 years. They were drawn away to Premiership side <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> in the last 16, a match they lost 2–0. Tottenham went on to <a href="2008%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">win the competition</a>.
Blackpool finished the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%202007-08">2007–08</a> season in 19th place, escaping relegation by two points and ensuring their safety in a 1–1 draw with <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a> on the final day of the Championship season.
On 23 December 2008, Simon Grayson left the club to join <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a> club <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> after just over three years in charge at Bloomfield Road. Under the guidance of Grayson's assistant <a href="Tony%20Parkes">Tony Parkes</a>, as caretaker manager, Blackpool finished the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%202008-09">2008–09</a> campaign in 16th place. Parkes left the club on 18 May 2009 after a meeting with chairman Karl Oyston about finances.
On 21 May 2009, <a href="Ian%20Holloway">Ian Holloway</a> was appointed as manager, signing a one-year contract with the club with an option of a further year. On 31 July it was announced that club president <a href="Val%C4%93rijs%20Beloko%C5%86s">Valērijs Belokoņs</a> was setting up a new transfer fund, into which he was adding a "considerable amount" to invest in new players identified by Holloway. Four days later Blackpool broke their <a href="List%20of%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics%23Record%20transfer-fee%20progression">transfer record</a> by signing <a href="Charlie%20Adam%20%28footballer%20born%201985%29">Charlie Adam</a> from Scottish champions <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> for £500,000, topping the £275,000 paid to <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> for <a href="Chris%20Malkin">Chris Malkin</a> in 1996.
Blackpool finished the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%202009%E2%80%9310">2009–10</a> regular season in sixth place in the Championship, their highest finish in the Football League since <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201970%E2%80%9371">1970–71</a>, and claimed a spot in the play-offs. On 2 May 2010, the 57th anniversary of Blackpool's FA Cup final victory, Blackpool hosted <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> for the final League game of the season. They needed to match or better <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a>'s result in their match at home to <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a>. Both matches ended in draws, with Swansea's <a href="Lee%20Trundle">Lee Trundle</a> having a late goal disallowed for handball, which meant Blackpool secured the remaining play-off place.
On 8 May, Blackpool beat <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> 2–1 at Bloomfield Road in the semi-final first leg. Three days later, they beat them 4–3 (6–4 on aggregate) at the <a href="City%20Ground">City Ground</a> in the second leg to progress to the final against Cardiff. The result meant Blackpool had beaten Forest in all four of the clubs' meetings in 2009–10.
Blackpool defeated <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> 3–2 on 22 May in the <a href="2010%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20final">Championship play-off final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> to earn promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. It was Blackpool's debut appearance in the Premier League in its 18-year existence and their first appearance in English football's top flight in <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201970%E2%80%9371">39 years</a>. Blackpool had now, uniquely, been promoted through all three tiers of the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> via the play-off system. Furthermore, they won all nine play-off games they were involved in during the 10 seasons between 2001 and 2010. The fixture was dubbed "the richest game in football", because the victorious club would receive a £90 million windfall. It was more than double the £36 million that the winners of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> received.
On 24 May, a promotion parade was held along Blackpool's promenade for the club's personnel, who travelled on an open-top <a href="double-decker%20bus">double-decker bus</a> from Gynn Square down the <a href="Golden%20Mile%20%28Blackpool%29">Golden Mile</a> to the Waterloo Headland. The police estimated that about 100,000 people lined the route. At the Headland, the manager and squad took to a stage to address the gathered mass crowd. "This is the most unbelievable moment of my life," said Ian Holloway. "I've jumped on the best ride of my life and I don't want to go home."
Premier League campaign (2010–11).
In their first-ever Premier League match on 14 August 2010, Blackpool defeated <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> 4–0 at the <a href="DW%20Stadium">DW Stadium</a>. The result saw "the Seasiders" at the top of the entire English football pyramid until <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>'s 6–0 victory over <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> later in the day. It was the first time they had been in such a position since they won their opening game of the <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season">1957–58</a> <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">top-flight</a> campaign. The initial fixture list had the game being played at Bloomfield Road, but the Premier League allowed the fixture to be reversed because construction work on Bloomfield Road's East Stand had not been completed in time.
On 27 January 2011, the Premier League fined Blackpool £25,000 for fielding what they believed to be a weakened team against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> on 10 November. Ian Holloway, who initially threatened to resign if punishment was dealt, had made 10 changes to the team for the fixture. The club had 14 days to appeal against the decision but chose not to, with Karl Oyston saying that if the punishment was upheld there was a threat of a point deduction and an increase in the fine.
On 22 May 2011, exactly 365 days after their promotion, Blackpool were relegated back to the Championship after losing 4–2 at champions Manchester United on the final day of the season, though results elsewhere also impacted the final league standings. Despite predictions that they "wouldn't get 10 points," Blackpool took 39 from their 38 games, including home and away victories over <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, consecutive away wins at <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> and <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, and a home victory over <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. Seven of their 10 overall wins were obtained before the new year, and at the end of 2010 they sat in eighth place; however, seven defeats in the opening eight fixtures of 2011 saw them drop down the table. The next match, a draw at home Aston Villa, left them in 15th, their lowest placing of the campaign to date. Another run of defeats – this time five in six – put them in the relegation zone for the first time. They climbed out of the bottom three, at the expense of Wigan Athletic, with successive home draws against <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> and <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a>. Blackpool dropped back into the relegation zone after conceding a late equaliser to draw at Tottenham, switching places with Wolves; they were level on points with Wigan and three ahead of bottom club <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>. A victory, their first in three months, over <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>, in their penultimate league fixture, was not enough to change the position as <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a> won at <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>. Blackpool went to <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> for the final match and were leading 2–1 12 minutes into the second half, but Manchester United, who were crowned champions a week earlier, took control and won 4–2 to condemn 19th-placed Blackpool to relegation along with <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> and West Ham United.
Fall to the fourth tier (2011–2017).
In July 2011, Blackpool smashed their outgoing transfer record when Charlie Adam signed for <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in a £7-million deal. A portion of these funds was used to bring former <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a>, <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>, <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> and Birmingham captain <a href="Barry%20Ferguson">Barry Ferguson</a> to Bloomfield Road, where he once again assumed the armband. On 9 May 2012, Blackpool secured their place in the Championship play-off final in their second consecutive season in the division after beating <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals. They met West Ham United in the final at Wembley on 19 May, losing 2–1, conceding a last-gasp goal to "the Hammers" <a href="Ricardo%20Vaz%20T%C3%AA">Ricardo Vaz Tê</a>, their first play-off final reversal in 21 years.
On 3 November 2012, Ian Holloway decided to leave Blackpool after accepting an offer from fellow Championship club <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> to be their manager. He was replaced four days later by <a href="Michael%20Appleton">Michael Appleton</a>, who left League One side <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> to take up the position; however, after being in charge for just two months, Appleton left for Lancashire neighbours <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, becoming the shortest-serving manager in Blackpool's history. On 18 February, after just over a month without an appointment, the club made former England captain <a href="Paul%20Ince">Paul Ince</a> their third manager of the campaign. It was under Ince that the club made their best-ever start to a league season. Their victory at <a href="AFC%20Bournemouth">AFC Bournemouth</a> on 14 September 2013 gave them 16 points out of a possible 18. The sequence of results was two wins, a draw, and three wins. This was countered by a run of nine defeats in 10 games, which resulted in Ince being sacked on 21 January 2014, 11 months into his tenure.
Barry Ferguson was named caretaker manager upon Ince's dismissal. Of Ferguson's 20 league games in charge, Blackpool won just three and finished the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a> season in 20th place. On 11 June 2014, almost five months after Paul Ince's dismissal, the club appointed Belgian <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Riga">José Riga</a> as manager. He was Blackpool's first overseas manager.
Prior to the start of <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">the 2014–15 season</a> Blackpool suffered a major crisis with some 27 players leaving the club; just two weeks before the season started, the club had only eight outfield players and no goalkeeper. Riga was able to assemble a squad in time for Blackpool's first game against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest">Nottingham Forest</a>, but could still only name four substitutes instead of the permitted seven. Blackpool lost the match 2–0. On 27 October 2014, after 15 games in charge, Riga was sacked and replaced by <a href="Lee%20Clark%20%28footballer%29">Lee Clark</a>.
On 6 April 2015, with six league fixtures remaining, Blackpool were relegated to League One. On 2 May 2015, the final match of the Championship season against Huddersfield Town was abandoned in the 48th minute following an on-pitch protest by hundreds of Blackpool supporters regarding the actions and management style of the directors and owners. The Football League subsequently declared the result the 0–0 scoreline it was at the time of abandonment, which meant Blackpool finished the season with 26 points. Following the resignation of <a href="Lee%20Clark%20%28footballer%29">Lee Clark</a> on 9 May 2015, Blackpool appointed <a href="Neil%20McDonald%20%28footballer%29">Neil McDonald</a> as manager on 2 June.
In May 2016, a second successive relegation occurred, which put Blackpool in the bottom tier of English professional football for the first time in 15 years. Less than two weeks later, Neil McDonald was sacked as manager. He was replaced by <a href="Gary%20Bowyer">Gary Bowyer</a>, the club's eighth manager in three-and-a-half years.
In late 2016, as the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20football%20sexual%20abuse%20scandal">sexual abuse scandal</a> developed, former Blackpool player <a href="Paul%20Stewart%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201964%29">Paul Stewart</a> alleged he had been abused by Frank Roper, a coach associated with Blackpool in the 1980s.
In May 2017, under Bowyer, Blackpool won promotion to League One after beating <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> 2–1 at Wembley in the play-off final. The victory meant that Blackpool became the most successful side in English play-off history, winning their fifth final.
End of the Oyston era (2017–2019).
On 10 November 2017, Blackpool was put up for sale by the Oyston family. The sale included the club itself and the properties division that owns Bloomfield Road stadium.
On 2 February 2018, Owen Oyston relieved Karl Oyston of his role as chairman and appointed his 32-year-old daughter, Natalie Christopher, in his place, just two weeks after appointing her to the club's board.
Gary Bowyer resigned in August 2018 after two years in charge, after the first game of the season for undisclosed reasons. He was replaced with his assistant <a href="Terry%20McPhillips">Terry McPhillips</a> as caretaker manager. McPhillips was made the permanent manager a month later.
On 13 February 2019, the football club was put into <a href="receivership">receivership</a> by the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a>, which forced Owen Oyston to pay ex-director Valērijs Belokoņs some of the £25m he was owed. Oyston was removed from the board of the club by the receiver on 25 February 2019. The receiver was tasked with discharging some of Oyston's assets, as well as Blackpool Football Club (Properties) Ltd, which owns the football club. The ruling could have resulted in the club being deducted 12 league points; however, this was eventually ruled against by the <a href="English%20Football%20League">EFL</a> on 11 April 2019.
Under new ownership (2019–present).
On 13 June 2019, Simon Sadler was announced as the new owner of the club, officially ending the Oystons' 32-year tenure, purchasing a 96.2% stake. Sadler was born and raised in Blackpool and has worked in asset management in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> since 2007. He is the founder and Chief Investment Officer of <a href="Segantii%20Capital%20Management">Segantii Capital Management</a>.
Terry McPhillips resigned as Blackpool manager on 5 July 2019, having informed the club's board that he had no long-term desire to be a manager. He was replaced by <a href="Simon%20Grayson">Simon Grayson</a>, who returned for a second spell in charge; however, after a long run of defeats, he was sacked on 12 February 2020. Grayson's last game in charge was a 3–2 home loss to Gillingham. Liverpool U23s manager <a href="Neil%20Critchley">Neil Critchley</a> was appointed head coach – the first such role for the club – as his replacement on 2 March 2020. After a curtailed regular season due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom</a>, Blackpool finished the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season">2019–20 season</a> in 13th position after standings were amended to reflect a points-per-game ratio.
At the end of <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">the following campaign</a>, Blackpool were promoted back to the second tier of English football, after a six-year absence, after winning the <a href="2021%20EFL%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">2021 EFL League One play-off final</a>. It was Blackpool's sixth victory in a play-off final in eight such appearances.
On 2 June 2022, Neil Critchley resigned from his role as head coach and joined Aston Villa as assistant head coach. Critchley told Simon Sadler he was keen to work again with <a href="Steven%20Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> and "pit himself against some of the best coaches in the world". Just over two weeks later, the club appointed its former manager Michael Appleton as Critchley's successor. Appleton was sacked seven months later, on 18 January 2023, after the club managed one win in eleven games. Veteran <a href="Mick%20McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> was appointed to oversee the rest of the season, but an Easter Monday defeat at home to fellow strugglers <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> ended his spell in charge. Interim manager and former "Seasiders" striker <a href="Stephen%20Dobbie">Stephen Dobbie</a> could not keep them in the division. Blackpool were relegated to League One after a home defeat to Millwall on 28 April 2023.
Colours.
Blackpool first began wearing tangerine for the <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.%20season%201923-24">1923–24</a> season, after a recommendation from referee Albert Hargreaves, who officiated an international match between <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">the Netherlands</a> and <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a> and was impressed by the Dutchmen's colours.
Before changing to tangerine permanently, the team tried several different colours: blue-and-white striped shirts in the 1890s (becoming known as "the" Merry Stripes); a mixture of red or white shirts at the turn of the 20th century; and, during the First World War, black, yellow and red. The latter was adopted to include the colours of the flag of <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, a show of support for the large number of Belgian refugees that had arrived in the town. After the war, they wore white shirts and navy-blue shorts. The board introduced another change in 1934 when the team appeared in alternating dark- and light-blue stripes (which have been reintroduced several times in the mid-1990s and 2002, for Blackpool's return to the top flight in 2010 as the club's third kit, and as their away kit in <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Blackpool%20F.C.%20season">2019–20</a>), but they bowed to public pressure in 1939 and settled on tangerine. Between 1938 and 1958 Blackpool's kit consisted of tangerine shirts, white shorts and navy blue socks. The club now uses tangerine socks, though navy was used as a secondary colour in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Stadium.
Blackpool have played their home games at Bloomfield Road since 1901. The stadium's current capacity is 16,616, all-seated.
In the summer of 2010, work was done on the stadium to prepare for the club's debut season in the Premier League. A new 5,120-capacity temporary East Stand was built, together with improvements to the floodlighting, media and medical facilities and the dugouts. Painting work was also done on the Stanley Matthews (West) Stand and the Mortensen Kop (North Stand). A new video screen was also installed. A new South Stand named after Jimmy Armfield was opened in 2010 with 3,600 seats. From the first home game in the Premier League, against <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> on 28 August 2010, the capacity was 16,220, the highest at Bloomfield Road in 30 years.
In the 2011–12 season, the south east corner between the Armfield Stand and the temporary East Stand was filled with an additional 500 seats, the area also incorporating the BFC Hotel, which welcomed its first guests at the end of June 2012. It was officially opened on 26 July 2012, the club's 125th anniversary. The hotel has a <a href="Hotel%20rating">four-star</a> rating, although the source of the accreditation is not specified on its website. It also houses a conference centre. From the 2015–16 season to Blackpool's homecoming game against <a href="Southend%20United">Southend United</a>, the East Stand had been closed to fans. In the latter part of the 2018–19 EFL League One season, away fans moved to the North-East Stand. As of the 2019–20 season, away fans are now accommodated in the East Stand.
Supporters.
Blackpool supporters are known by the general terms Tangerine Army or Seaside Barmy Army. Whilst Blackpool had the lowest average home attendance in the Premier League, the atmosphere generated by the home support was regarded as loud and intimidating.
After Steve McMahon resigned as Blackpool manager in 2004, he said of the Tangerine support: "During my time here, the supporters have been fantastic and are a credit to the club. Whilst they have that support, I am sure they can go a long way. I think both on and off the pitch the club is going forward in a big way and unfortunately I'm not part of that anymore." The club was promoted three years later to the Championship, and again in 2010 to the Premier League for the 2010–11 season.
In September 2009, freelance journalist Mike Whalley said after attending a game against <a href="Peterborough%20United%20F.C.">Peterborough United</a>: "The home fans certainly make plenty of noise. Bloomfield Road does not lack for atmosphere. Or a drummer. Every home game is played to a thumping drum beat." After Blackpool beat <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> 2–1 on 16 September 2009, Scott Wilson of "<a href="the%20Northern%20Echo">the Northern Echo</a>" wrote: "Almost 10,000 spectators created a hostile and intimidating atmosphere that was a throwback to footballing days gone by" while the <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a> match report described the Blackpool support as "boisterous".
On 28 August 2010 Blackpool played <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in their first-ever home Premier League game, in front of a crowd of 15,529, the largest attendance for over 30 years at Bloomfield Road. On <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a>' "<a href="Football%20First">Football First</a>" programme, co-commentator <a href="Barry%20Horne%20%28footballer%29">Barry Horne</a> said: "They are a fantastic crowd. I've watched a lot of Championship games here and the crowd have always been brilliant; they get behind their team." Commentator Will Cope later said: "It's deafening; deafening by the seaside. You wouldn't have thought 15,000 fans could make so much noise." After the game Fulham manager <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a> also praised the home support saying that the atmosphere in the stadium would really help the team in their debut season in the Premier League.
During the 2010–11 Premier League campaign, a <a href="decibel">decibel</a>-metre was set up three times at each stadium, and an average then taken to indicate the loudest supporters. Despite having a capacity of 16,220, the Blackpool support was ranked the fifth-loudest, at 85 decibels.
In January 2013, a supporters' group named SISA (Seasiders Independent Supporters Association) was formed. It folded in July the following year to become Blackpool Supporters Trust.
Blackpool Fans' Progress Group, a supporters' liaison group, was founded in 2015.
Rivalries.
Blackpool's primary rival is <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> – the two clubs' grounds being seventeen miles apart – and matches between the two clubs are known as the <a href="West%20Lancashire%20derby">West Lancashire derby</a>. They have met 96 times across all four divisions of the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a>, including the old <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20One">First Division</a>, and eight times in either the FA Cup and League Cup (Blackpool having won none of the ties).
Since 2012–13, a <a href="Fylde%20Coast%20derby">Fylde Coast derby</a> has developed with <a href="Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.">Fleetwood Town</a>. Eight-and-a-half miles separate Bloomfield Road and "The Fishermen"s <a href="Highbury%20Stadium%2C%20Fleetwood">Highbury Stadium</a>.
According to a survey conducted in 2019, Blackpool's other significant rivalries are with <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>, <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> and <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>.
Players.
Reserve team.
Up until the 2009–10 season the reserve team competed in the <a href="The%20Central%20League">Central League</a> <a href="The%20Central%20League%23Division%20One%20West">Division One West</a>. They have been Central League champions twice, in 1919–20 and 1949–50.
With the first team promoted to the Premier League, for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Premier%20Reserve%20League">2010–11 season</a> the reserves competed in the <a href="Premier%20Reserve%20League">Premier Reserve League</a>. They were in <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Premier%20Reserve%20League%23Premier%20Reserve%20League%20North%20Group%20B">North Group B</a>, with <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>, <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%20Reserves%20and%20Academy">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>. At the end of the campaign, the club withdrew from reserve league football, preferring to play such games <a href="behind%20closed%20doors%20%28football%29">behind closed doors</a>.
Blackpool reintroduced reserve-team football for the 2019–20 season. They joined a regional five-team Central Division.
Academy.
The club's Academy, headed by <a href="Ciaran%20Donnelly%20%28footballer%29">Ciaran Donnelly</a>, is rated as <a href="Elite%20Player%20Performance%20Plan">Category 3</a> (the highest, of four categories, being Category 1). It consists of an under-18s squad and a development squad. As of 2021, the Academy had around 140 players, ranging in age from six to twenty-one, and employed twelve full-time members of staff. Its facilities are split between <a href="Myerscough%20College">Myerscough College</a> and Blackpool's Stanley Park.
Internationals.
Blackpool have had 61 full-international representatives. Their first was <a href="Fred%20Griffiths%20%28footballer%29">Fred Griffiths</a>, for <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a>, in 1900. Their most recent was <a href="CJ%20Hamilton%20%28footballer%29">CJ Hamilton</a>, for the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland</a>, in 2022. In 1996, Northern Ireland's <a href="James%20Quinn%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201974%29">James Quinn</a> became the club's first player in sixteen years to be selected for a full international, the previous one being <a href="Derek%20Spence">Derek Spence</a> in 1980.

Training facility.
Blackpool's training ground, currently known as the e-Energy Training Centre, is located in the <a href="Squires%20Gate%2C%20Blackpool">Squires Gate</a> area of Blackpool's <a href="South%20Shore%2C%20Blackpool">South Shore</a>. It has been used, with minimal upkeep, since the 1940s. It was described by Blackpool manager Ian Holloway as a "hell hole" in 2009, shortly after which chairman Karl Oyston pledged to build a new facility. "We are never going back to our training ground again," explained Holloway. "Every player this club has ever had hates it, and every player we have is frightened of it. It is a horrible environment to work in." In 2009, with the training ground frozen, Holloway attempted to train on Blackpool's beach, but that too was iced over. An initial plan was to use the facilities of <a href="Fylde%20Rugby%20Club">Fylde Rugby Club</a>, but training is still held at the two-pitch Squires Gate, however, and no development has come to fruition.
In August 2014, former Blackpool defender <a href="Alex%20Baptiste">Alex Baptiste</a> reminisced on his time at Squires Gate: "No balls in training, having to run on the beach because the pitch had been frozen for two weeks, no food after training, leaks in the <a href="Portacabin">Portacabin</a>s, having to buy our own weights – just random stuff like that! It was definitely an experience!"
In June 2020, the club purchased a <a href="modular%20building">modular building</a> for the training ground. It includes changing facilities for players and staff, along with eating areas, meeting rooms and medical facilities.
A site for a new training facility, bordering the Grange Park Estate and <a href="Baines%20School">Baines School</a> on Garstang Road, was purchased in May 2022. The new training facility, combined with replacing Bloomfield Road's temporary East Stand with a permanent structure, is estimated to cost between £30 and £40 million. A planning application was expected to be submitted in May 2023.
Managers.
Including repeat appointments, there have been 39 full-time managers of Blackpool F.C., the first being <a href="Bill%20Norman%20%28football%20manager%29">Bill Norman</a> between 1918 and 1923. The longest-serving manager was <a href="Joe%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%201889%E2%80%931971%29">Joe Smith</a>, who occupied the role for 23 years; <a href="Michael%20Appleton">Michael Appleton</a>, meanwhile, lasted 65 days in the role in his first stint at the club. Blackpool has, on average, appointed a new manager just under every three years. As of May 2023, the club has had twelve full-time managers in eleven years.
There have been five repeat appointments: <a href="Bob%20Stokoe">Bob Stokoe</a>, <a href="Allan%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201926%29">Allan Brown</a>, <a href="Simon%20Grayson">Simon Grayson</a>, <a href="Michael%20Appleton">Michael Appleton</a>, and Neil Critchley.
In 2014, <a href="Jose%20Riga">Jose Riga</a> became the club's first foreign manager.
In 2020, <a href="Neil%20Critchley">Neil Critchley</a> became the first appointment to be known as a <a href="head%20coach">head coach</a>.

Norwich City F.C.

Norwich City Football Club is an English professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>, Norfolk. Norwich compete in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>, the second tier of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. The club was founded in 1902. Since 1935, Norwich have played their home games at <a href="Carrow%20Road">Carrow Road</a> and have a long-standing rivalry with East Anglian rivals <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>, with whom they have contested the <a href="East%20Anglian%20derby">East Anglian derby</a> since 1902.
Norwich have won the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> twice, in <a href="1962%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1962</a> and <a href="1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1985</a>. The club's highest ever league finish came in the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Premier%20League">1992–93 season</a> when they finished third in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. Norwich have featured in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> once, in the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20UEFA%20Cup">1993–94 season</a>, where they were defeated in the third round, but en route became the first English club to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich%201%E2%80%932%20Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20%281993%29">defeat</a> German side <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> at the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Munich%29">Olympiastadion</a> in Munich.
The club is nicknamed "The Canaries" after the history of breeding the birds in the area, which is represented in the team's yellow-and-green kits. The fans' song "<a href="On%20The%20Ball%2C%20City">On The Ball, City</a>" is the oldest football chant in the world, written in the 1890s and still sung today.
History.
Early years (1902–1934).
Norwich City F.C. was formed after a meeting at the Criterion Café in Norwich on 17 June 1902 and played their first competitive match, against <a href="Harwich%20%26amp%3B%20Parkeston%20F.C.">Harwich & Parkeston</a>, at <a href="Newmarket%20Road%20%28football%20ground%29">Newmarket Road</a> on 6 September 1902. They joined the <a href="Norfolk%20%26amp%3B%20Suffolk%20League">Norfolk & Suffolk League</a> for the 1902–03 season, but following a <a href="the%20Football%20Association">FA</a> commission, the club was ousted from the amateur game in 1905, as it was deemed a professional organisation. Later that year Norwich were elected to play in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>. With increasing crowds, they were forced to leave Newmarket Road in 1908 and moved to The Nest, a disused chalk pit. The club's original nickname was the Citizens, but this was superseded by 1907 by the Canaries after the club's chairman (who was a keen breeder of canaries) dubbed his boys "The Canaries" and changed their strip to yellow and green. During the First World War, with football suspended and facing spiralling debts, City went into voluntary <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a> on 10 December 1917.
The club was officially reformed on 15 February 1919 – a key figure in the event was Charles Frederick Watling, future lord mayor of Norwich and the father of future club chairman, <a href="Geoffrey%20Watling">Geoffrey Watling</a>. When <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> formed a third Division in May 1920, Norwich joined the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for the following season. Their first league fixture, against <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a>, on 28 August 1920, ended in a 1–1 draw. The club went on to endure a mediocre decade, finishing no higher than eighth but no lower than 18th. The following decade proved more successful for the club with a club-record victory, 10–2, over <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>. Norwich were promoted as champions to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34</a> season under the management of <a href="Tom%20Parker%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201897%29">Tom Parker</a>.
Move to Carrow Road and an FA Cup semi-final (1934–1959).
With crowds continuing to rise, and with the Football Association raising concerns over the suitability of The Nest, the club considered renovation of the ground, but ultimately decided on a move to <a href="Carrow%20Road">Carrow Road</a>. The inaugural match, on 31 August 1935 against <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>, ended in a 4–3 victory for the home team and set a new record attendance of 29,779. The biggest highlight of the following four seasons was the visit of <a href="King%20George%20VI">King George VI</a> to Carrow Road on 29 October 1938. However the club was relegated to the Third Division at the end of the season. 
The league was suspended the following season due to the Second World War, and did not resume until the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20in%20English%20football">1946–47</a> season. City finished this and the following season in 21st place, the poor results forcing the club to apply for re-election to the league. The club narrowly missed out on promotion under the guidance of manager <a href="Norman%20Low">Norman Low</a> in the early 1950s, but following the return of Tom Parker as manager, Norwich finished bottom of the football league in the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57</a> season.
Events off the field were to overshadow the team's performances as the club faced financial difficulties severe enough to render them non-viable. With debts amounting to more than £20,000, the club was rescued by the formation of a new board, chaired by Geoffrey Watling and the creation of an appeal fund chaired by the <a href="Lord%20Mayor">Lord Mayor</a> of Norwich, <a href="Arthur%20South">Arthur South</a>, which raised more than £20,000. For these and other services to the club, both men (now deceased) were later honoured by having <a href="Carrow%20Road%23Stands">stands named after them at Carrow Road</a>.
<a href="Archie%20Macaulay">Archie Macaulay</a> became manager when the club was reformed and he oversaw one of the club's greatest achievements, its run to the semi-final of the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20FA%20Cup">1958–59 FA Cup</a>. Competing as a <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> side, Norwich defeated two First Division opponents along the way, notably a 3–0 win against the <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> "<a href="Busby%20Babes">Busby Babes</a>". City lost the semi-final only after a replay against another First Division side, <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>. The team of 1958–59 – including <a href="Terry%20Bly">Terry Bly</a> who scored seven goals in the run, and <a href="Ken%20Nethercott">Ken Nethercott</a> who played most of the second half of one match in goal despite a dislocated shoulder – is today well represented in the <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20Hall%20of%20Fame">club Hall of Fame</a>. The "59 Cup Run" as it is now known locally, "remains as one of the truly great periods in Norwich City's history". Norwich were the third-ever Third Division team to reach the FA Cup semi-final.
League Cup glory and a place in the First Division (1959–1980).
In the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20in%20English%20football">1959–60</a> season, Norwich were promoted to the Second Division after finishing second to <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>, and achieved a fourth-place finish in the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a> season. In 1962 <a href="Ron%20Ashman">Ron Ashman</a> guided Norwich to their first trophy, defeating <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a> 4–0 on <a href="Aggregate%20score">aggregate</a> in a two-legged final to win the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>.
Sixth place in the league was the closest the club came to promotion to the First Division again during the 1960s, but after winning the division in the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20in%20English%20football">1971–72</a> season under manager <a href="Ron%20Saunders">Ron Saunders</a>, Norwich City reached the highest level of English football for the first time. They made their first appearance at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in 1973, losing the <a href="1973%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a> 1–0 to Tottenham Hotspur.
Relegation to the Second Division in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20in%20English%20football">1973–74 season</a> came after Saunders had departed and been succeeded by <a href="John%20Bond%20%28footballer%29">John Bond</a>, but the board of directors kept faith in Bond and were quickly rewarded. A highly successful <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">first season</a> saw promotion back to the First Division, and another visit to Wembley, again in the League Cup final, this time losing 1–0 to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>.
Promotion, silverware and more cup runs (1980–1992).
Bond departed to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in autumn 1980, and the club were relegated six months later, but bounced back the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20in%20English%20football">following season</a> after finishing third under Bond's successor <a href="Ken%20Brown%20%28footballer%29">Ken Brown</a>. In August 1981, Norwich City striker <a href="Justin%20Fashanu">Justin Fashanu</a> became the first black footballer to command a £1 million <a href="transfer%20fee">transfer fee</a> when he moved to <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>.
The <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85 season</a> was of mixed fortunes for the club; under Brown's guidance, they reached <a href="1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">the final</a> of the Football League Cup at Wembley Stadium, having defeated <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> in the semi-final. In the final, they beat <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> 1–0, but in the league, both Norwich and Sunderland were relegated to the second tier of English football, Norwich going down by only one point. This made Norwich the first English club to win a major trophy and suffer relegation in the same season; something which was not matched until Birmingham City also suffered relegation the season they won the League Cup 26 years later.
Norwich were also denied their first foray into Europe with the ban on English clubs after the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>. City bounced back to the top flight by winning the Second Division championship in the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1985–86</a> season. This was the start a club-record nine consecutive seasons in the top division of English football. High league placing in the First Division in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89</a> would have been enough for UEFA Cup qualification, but the ban on English clubs remained. They also had good cup runs during this period, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 1989 and again in 1992.
Early success in the Premier League era (1992–1995).
During <a href="1992-93%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a>, the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">inaugural season</a> of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, Norwich City quickly emerged as surprise title contenders, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and runners-up Aston Villa. The following season Norwich participated in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> for the first (and only) time, losing in the third round to <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a>, but defeating <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich%201%E2%80%932%20Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20%281993%29">Winning 2–1</a>, Norwich were the first British team to beat Bayern Munich in the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Munich%29">Olympiastadion</a>. 
<a href="Mike%20Walker%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Mike Walker</a> quit as Norwich City manager in January 1994, to take charge of <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> and was replaced by first team coach <a href="John%20Deehan">John Deehan</a> who led the club to 12th place in the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94</a> season in the Premier League. Norwich began the <a href="1994-95%20in%20English%20football">1994–95 season</a> well, despite the pre-season departure of top scorer <a href="Chris%20Sutton">Chris Sutton</a> to <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> for a British record fee of £5 million, and by Christmas they were seventh in the league. Norwich then won only one of their final 20 league games, and slumped to 20th place and relegation, ending a nine-season run in the top flight.
The First Division years (1995–2003).
Shortly before relegation, Deehan resigned as manager and his assistant <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a> took over until the end of the season. <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a>, who had taken <a href="Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wycombe Wanderers</a> from the Conference to the Second Division with successive promotions, was appointed as Norwich City manager in summer 1995. He lasted just six months in the job before resigning after a dispute with chairman <a href="Robert%20Chase%20%28businessman%29">Robert Chase</a> over money to strengthen the squad. Soon after, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players and was to blame for their relegation. Chase's majority stakeholding was bought by Geoffrey Watling.
English television cook <a href="Delia%20Smith">Delia Smith</a> and husband <a href="Michael%20Wynn-Jones">Michael Wynn-Jones</a> took over the majority of Norwich City's shares from Watling in 1996, and Mike Walker was re-appointed as the club's manager. He was unable to repeat the success achieved during his first spell and was dismissed two seasons later with Norwich mid-table in Division One. <a href="Nigel%20Worthington">Nigel Worthington</a> took over as Norwich City manager in December 2000 following an unsuccessful two years for the club under <a href="Bruce%20Rioch">Bruce Rioch</a> and then <a href="Bryan%20Hamilton">Bryan Hamilton</a>. He had been on the coaching staff under Hamilton who resigned with the club 20th in the First Division and in real danger of relegation to the third tier of English football for the first time since the 1960s. Worthington avoided the threat of relegation and, the following season, led City to a <a href="2002%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20Final">play-off final</a> at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a>, which Norwich lost against <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> on <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a>.
Return to the Premier League (2003–2009).
The <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04 season</a> saw the club win the First Division title, finishing eight points clear of second-placed <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> and returned to the top flight for the first time since 1995. For much of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">2004–05 season</a>, the club struggled and a last day 6–0 defeat away to <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> condemned them to relegation. The club finished in ninth place in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06 season</a> and, as results in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07 season</a> went against City, Worthington was dismissed in October 2006, directly after a 4–1 defeat by <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>.
In October 2006, Norwich announced that former City player <a href="Peter%20Grant%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201965%29">Peter Grant</a> had left West Ham United to become the new manager. Grant's side struggled for most of the season and made a poor start to the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08 season</a>, with only two wins by mid October; following a 1–0 defeat at fellow-strugglers <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>, Grant left the club by mutual consent on in October 2007. Later the same month, former <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> manager <a href="Glenn%20Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a> was confirmed as Grant's replacement.
Roeder kept Norwich in the Championship with a 3–0 win over Queens Park Rangers, Norwich's penultimate game of the season.
Yo-yo years (2009–present).
In January 2009, Roeder was relieved of his duties as manager and, shortly after, former Norwich goalkeeper <a href="Bryan%20Gunn">Bryan Gunn</a> was appointed until the end of the season. However, he was unable to prevent the club from being relegated in May 2009, after a 4–2 defeat away to already relegated <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>. Following their relegation, their first game of the season resulted in a 7–1 home defeat against East Anglian rivals <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a>. This was the club's heaviest ever home defeat and Gunn was dismissed six days later.
On 18 August 2009, <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a> was announced as the new manager, leaving his post at Colchester, and nine months later led Norwich to promotion back to the Championship as League One Champions, after a single season in League One. The following season saw Norwich promoted to the Premier League, finishing second in the table and completing the first back-to-back promotions from the third tier to the first since Manchester City in 2000.
The club finished in 12th place in their first season back in the Premier League. However, Lambert resigned within a month of the season's close to take up the vacant managerial spot at league rivals Aston Villa and was replaced by <a href="Chris%20Hughton">Chris Hughton</a>. Hughton led Norwich to an 11th-place finish, including a ten-game unbeaten run in the league, but they were relegated back to the Championship after the 2013–14 season. Hughton was dismissed to be replaced by former Norwich player <a href="Neil%20Adams%20%28footballer%29">Neil Adams</a>.
After a mediocre first half of the 2014–15 season, Adams resigned in January 2015 and <a href="Hamilton%20Academical%20F.C.">Hamilton Academical</a> manager <a href="Alex%20Neil%20%28footballer%29">Alex Neil</a> was appointed as Norwich manager four days later. The appointment reinvigorated Norwich's season, and victory in the <a href="2015%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">2015 Championship play-off final</a> secured an immediate return to the top division of English football. This was only temporary relief, as at the end of the next season they were relegated again to play the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20season">2016–17 season</a> in the Championship.
The following season started successfully, with the club sitting top of the Championship in mid-October. However, a poor run of form and results followed and in March 2017, Neil was dismissed by the club. First-team coach <a href="Alan%20Irvine%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201958%29">Alan Irvine</a> was placed in caretaker charge for the remainder of the season, ultimately finishing in eighth.
In May 2017, the club appointed German coach <a href="Daniel%20Farke">Daniel Farke</a> as head coach, becoming the first head coach of the club in its 114-year history that was not from the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>. In Farke's first season, Norwich finished in 14th place. The following season was far more successful; helped by top scorer <a href="Teemu%20Pukki">Teemu Pukki</a>, the club was promoted back to the Premier League after a three-year absence as Championship winners. However, Norwich were once again relegated back to the Championship after just a single season back in the top flight, becoming the first team in Premier League history to be relegated five times from the division. The <a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo effect</a> continued unabated: in May 2021, Norwich were crowned winners of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>, securing promotion back to the top flight at the first time of asking, but they failed to win a match in their first nine games back in the Premier League in the 2021–22 season, and Farke was dismissed by the club in November. On 14 November 2021, the club appointed former <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a>, Brentford and Aston Villa manager <a href="Dean%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201971%29">Dean Smith</a> as their new head coach. Norwich completed a record sixth relegation from the Premier League, and, after an indifferent first half of the following season, Smith was dismissed in December 2022.
On 6 January 2023, the club appointed former <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke</a> and <a href="BSC%20Young%20Boys">Young Boys</a> manager <a href="David%20Wagner%20%28soccer%29">David Wagner</a> as their new head coach.
Colours and badge.
Norwich City's nickname, "The Canaries", has long influenced the team's colours and badge. Originally, the club was nicknamed the "Citizens" ("Cits" for short), and played in light blue and white halved shirts, although the halves were inconsistent: the blue was on the left on some shirts, and on the right for others. The earliest known recorded link between the club and canaries comes in an interview recorded in the "<a href="Eastern%20Daily%20Press">Eastern Daily Press</a>" with the newly appointed manager, <a href="John%20Bowman%20%28footballer%29">John Bowman</a> in April 1905. The paper quotes him saying "Well I knew of the City's existence... I have... heard of the canaries." "This as far as we can tell is the first time that the popular pastime of the day ie... rearing ... canaries was linked with Norwich City FC... the club still played in blue and white, and would continue to do so for another two seasons" wrote one history of the club.
By February 1907, the nickname Canaries had come more into vogue; thoughts that an FA Cup tie against West Bromwich Albion (nicknamed "Throstles" after a bird) was "a bird -singing contest" were dismissed by the polymath <a href="C.%20B.%20Fry">C. B. Fry</a> as "humbug" but the national press increasingly referred to the team as Canaries. The following season, to match the nickname, City played for the first time in Canary livery; "yellow shirts with green collars and cuffs. One paper produced the quote 'The Cits are dead but the Canaries are very much alive'." While the home colours of yellow and green remain to this day, the away colours have varied since introduction. For example, the away kit for the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20season">2012–13 season</a> was black shirts and shorts.
A simple canary badge was first adopted in 1922. The current club badge consists of a canary resting on a football with a stylised version of the <a href="Norwich">City of Norwich</a> <a href="Coat%20of%20arms">arms</a> in the top left corner. For the club's centenary celebrations in 2002, a special badge was designed, featuring two canaries looking left and right, plus a ribbon noting the centenary.
In November 2021, the club unveiled a new club badge that officially replaced the previous badge on all club branding from June 2022 and that would appear on club shirts from the 2022–23 season. It is a modernised version of its predecessor that removed black keylines around the badge, a redesigned version of the city's coat of arms that more closely resembles a lion and <a href="Norwich%20Castle">Norwich Castle</a>, and a redesigned canary on a ball that's more centralised in the badge than its predecessor.
Stadium.
Norwich City played at Newmarket Road from 1902 to 1908, with a record attendance of 10,366 against <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> in a second round FA Cup match in 1908. Following a dispute over the conditions of renting the Newmarket Road ground, in 1908 the club moved to a new home in a converted disused chalk pit in Rosary Road which became known as "<a href="The%20Nest%20%28football%20ground%29">The Nest</a>".
By the 1930s, the ground was too small for the growing crowds, and in 1935 the club moved to its current home in Carrow Road. The original stadium, "the largest construction job in the city since the building of Norwich Castle... was "miraculously" built in just 82 days... it was referred to [by club officials] as 'The eighth wonder of the world'" An aerial photograph from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing and a covered stand, with a <a href="Colman%27s">Colman's Mustard</a> advertisement painted on its roof, visible only from the air. Another photograph, taken on a match day that same season, shows that a parking area was provided at the ground.
Floodlights were erected at the ground in 1956, but their cost of £9,000 nearly sent the club into bankruptcy. The success in the 1959 FA Cup secured the financial status of the club and allowed a cover to be built over the South Stand. This was itself replaced in 2003 when a new 7,000 seat South stand was built in its place and subsequently renamed the Jarrold Stand.
1963 saw the record attendance for Carrow Road, with a crowd of 43,984 for a 6th round FA Cup match against <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>. After the <a href="1971%20Ibrox%20disaster">Ibrox disaster in 1971</a>, safety licences were required by clubs and this drastically reduced the ground's capacity to around 20,000. A two-tier terrace was built at the River End, and seats began to replace the terraces. By 1979 the stadium had a capacity of 28,392 with seats for 12,675. A fire in 1984 partially destroyed one of the stands, which eventually led to its complete demolition and replacement by 1987 of a new City Stand, which chairman Robert Chase described as "Coming to a football match within the City Stand is very much like going to the theatre – the only difference being that our stage is covered with grass". After the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> in 1989 and the subsequent outcome of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> in 1990, the stadium was converted to all-seater. It has a capacity of 27,359.
Supporters.
While much of the support that the club enjoys is local, there are a number of expatriate fan clubs, notably in London and stretching from Scandinavia to countries further afield such as the United Arab Emirates, North Macedonia, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Thailand, Australia and the United States.
The fans' song, "<a href="On%20the%20Ball%2C%20City">On the Ball, City</a>", is the oldest football song in the world still in use today; the song is older than the club itself, having probably been penned for Norwich Teachers or Caley's FC in the 1890s and adapted for Norwich City. Although the first use of the tune and song is disputed, it had been adopted by 1902 and it remains in use today in part if not the whole. The chorus is:
The club's main local rival is <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. When Norwich and Ipswich meet it is known as the <a href="East%20Anglian%20derby">East Anglian derby</a>, or, informally, as the 'Old Farm Derby' – a comic reference to the <a href="Old%20Firm">Old Firm</a> derby played between Scottish clubs <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> and <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>. Norwich are currently unbeaten against Ipswich since . Locally, much is made of the informal title "<a href="Pride%20of%20Anglia">Pride of Anglia</a>". Fans variously claim the title for either winning the East Anglian derby, finishing highest in the league, having the better current league position, having the more successful club history or for reasons without any apparent logical basis.
The club also maintains a healthy celebrity support with celebrity cook <a href="Delia%20Smith">Delia Smith</a> and comedian <a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a> both having moved from being fans of the club to running it. Actor <a href="Hugh%20Jackman">Hugh Jackman</a> is also a fan of the club, having been taken to Carrow Road as a child by his English mother, though he turned down an opportunity to become an investor in the club in 2010. Other well-known supporters include television presenter <a href="Simon%20Thomas%20%28presenter%29">Simon Thomas</a>, who is vice-president of the Norwich City Supporters Trust, Norfolk-born musician, model and media personality <a href="Myleene%20Klass">Myleene Klass</a>, fiction author <a href="Philip%20Pullman">Philip Pullman</a>, and former <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> politician <a href="Ed%20Balls">Ed Balls</a>. Journalist and broadcaster <a href="David%20Frost">David Frost</a> also declared his love for The Canaries during his lifetime.
In March 2018, supporters helped the club raise £5 million through a mini-bond investment scheme. The purpose of the mini-bond, called the Canaries Bond was to raise money to fund new academy facilities at Colney Training Ground for the <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20Under-23s%20and%20Academy">Norwich City F.C. Under-23s and Academy</a>.
Current ownership.
Norwich City F.C. is a public limited company that, in 2003, comprised approximately 8,000 individual shareholdings. , Delia Smith and husband Michael Wynn-Jones are the joint majority shareholders.
At the 2006–07 Norwich City FC Annual General Meeting (on 18 January 2007), Smith and Wynn-Jones announced that they would be open to offers to buy their majority stake-holding in the club. They made clear that any prospective buyer would have to invest heavily in the squad, with regards to team improving.
In September 2022, a general meeting of shareholders took place to discuss and voted for <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers">Milwaukee Brewers</a> owner <a href="Mark%20Attanasio">Mark Attanasio</a> to be appointed as a director at the club. Attanasio was expected to buy the 15.9% stake in the club as was owned by <a href="Michael%20Foulger">Michael Foulger</a>. It was later announced by the club he had purchased shares from a variety of holders, which included Foulger's shares. 
Records and statistics.
Ashman holds the record for Norwich league appearances, having played 592 first-team matches between 1947 and 1964. <a href="Ralph%20Hunt%20%28footballer%29">Ralph Hunt</a> holds the record for the most goals scored in a season, 31 in the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20in%20English%20football">1955–56</a> season in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a>, with <a href="Johnny%20Gavin%20%28footballer%29">Johnny Gavin</a> the top scorer over a career – 122 between 1948 and 1955

Norwich's record home attendance is 43,984 for a sixth-round <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> match against Leicester City on 30 March 1963. In the wake of the Ibrox stadium disaster in 1971, government regulations resulted in the capacity being drastically reduced to around 20,000. After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report in 1990, the stadium was converted to <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater</a>. As of July 2020, the capacity is 27,359.
The highest transfer fee received for a Norwich player is £33 million from Aston Villa for <a href="Emiliano%20Buend%C3%ADa">Emiliano Buendía</a> in June 2021, while the most spent by the club on a player was for the signing of <a href="Christos%20Tzolis">Christos Tzolis</a> for £8.8 million from <a href="PAOK%20FC">PAOK FC</a> in August 2021.
The club's highest league finish was third in the Premier League in 1992–93. The 2021–22 season was Norwich's 27th in the top flight of English football. The club has won the League Cup twice (most recently in 1985) and reached the FA Cup semi-final three times, most recently in 1992. Norwich have taken part in European competition once, reaching the third round of the UEFA Cup in 1993–94 and are the only English side to beat Bayern Munich in the Olympiastadion.
Players.
Development squad.
This team is made up of under-23 and academy players and is effectively Norwich City's second-string side, but is limited to three outfield players and one goalkeeper over the age of 23 per game.
In March 2018, the public mini-bond investment scheme mentioned above raised £5 million. With this investment, the club installed new pitches at its Category 1 Academy, as well as a new irrigation system, cameras for analysis and floodlights, a new main building, with a gym, classrooms, physios room, changing rooms and offices. A stand was also installed next to the main Academy pitch.

They won five <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> finals in the 19th century: <a href="1884%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1884</a>, <a href="1885%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1885</a>, <a href="1886%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1886</a>, <a href="1890%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1890</a> and <a href="1891%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1891</a>. The team was crowned <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">English League champions</a> in 1911–12 and 1913–14, then won a sixth FA Cup in <a href="1928%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1928</a>. They were relegated for the first time in 1936, but returned to the top-flight as <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> champions in 1938–39. Relegated in 1948, Rovers secured promotion again in 1957–58, but were relegated in 1966 and again in 1971. Blackburn won the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> title in 1974–75, and were again promoted in 1979–80 after suffering relegation the previous year. They won the <a href="Full%20Members%27%20Cup">Full Members' Cup</a> in <a href="1987%20Full%20Members%27%20Cup%20Final">1987</a>.
In 1992, Rovers gained promotion to the new <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> via the <a href="1992%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20Final">play-offs</a>, a year after being taken over by local entrepreneur <a href="Jack%20Walker">Jack Walker</a>, who installed <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> as manager. In <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20FA%20Premier%20League">1994–95</a>, Rovers became Premier League champions. Relegated four seasons after being crowned champions, they secured promotion at the end of the 2000–01 season, and won the <a href="2002%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2002 Football League Cup Final</a> the following year. They spent eleven successive seasons in the Premier League, but were relegated in 2012 and again into the third tier in 2017. Blackburn secured promotion out of <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> at the end of the 2017–18 season.
History.
Early years.
The club was founded following a meeting, at the Leger Hotel, Blackburn, on 5 November 1875. The meeting was organised by two young men, namely <a href="John%20Lewis%20%28referee%29">John Lewis</a> and Arthur Constantine, two old-boys of <a href="Shrewsbury%20School">Shrewsbury School</a>. The purpose of the meeting was "to discuss the possibility of forming a football club to play under Association rules". The first match played by Blackburn Rovers took place in <a href="Church%2C%20Lancashire">Church, Lancashire</a> on 18 December 1875 and was a 1–1 draw.
On 28 September 1878, Blackburn Rovers became one of 23 clubs to form the Lancashire Football Association. On 1 November 1879 the club played in the FA Cup for the first time, beating the Tyne Association Football Club 5–1. Rovers were eventually put out of the competition in the third round after suffering a heavy 6–0 defeat by <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>.
On 25 March 1882 the club won through to the final of the FA Cup against the <a href="Old%20Etonians%20F.C.">Old Etonians</a>. Blackburn Rovers was the first provincial team to reach the final, but the result was a 1–0 defeat by the Old Etonians.
Rovers finally won the FA Cup on 29 March 1884 with a 2–1 victory over the Scottish team <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20F.C.">Queen's Park</a>. The same teams played the FA Cup final again the next season, with Blackburn Rovers again emerging victorious, with a 2–0 score. Rovers repeated this success yet again the next season, winning the final replay 2–0 against <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. For this three-in-a-row of FA Cup victories, the club was awarded a specially commissioned silver shield.
The <a href="1885%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1885–86</a> season was the birth of the legal professional footballer, and Blackburn Rovers spent £615 on player wages for the season.
Football League commences.
Blackburn Rovers were founder members of the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1888.
Blackburn Rovers again reached the <a href="1890%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a> on 29 March 1890 at the <a href="Kennington%20Oval">Kennington Oval</a>. The club claimed the trophy for the fourth time, by beating <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> a hefty 6–1 with left forward <a href="William%20Townley">William Townley</a> scoring three goals and becoming the first player to achieve a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> in the FA Cup final.
The 1890–91 season saw Blackburn Rovers win the FA Cup for the fifth time against <a href="Notts%20County">Notts County</a> with a 3–1 victory. During the 1897–98 season the club were relegated but were elected back into the first division at the Football League's AGM along with <a href="Newcastle%20United">Newcastle United</a>. The season did, however, mark the beginning of <a href="Bob%20Crompton">Bob Crompton</a>'s 45-year association with the club, both as a player and eventually as an FA Cup winning manager.
Early 20th century.
Blackburn Rovers continued to struggle during the early years of the 20th century, but the results began a gradual improvement. Major renovations were made to Ewood Park: in 1905 the Darwen End was covered at a cost of £1680 and the new Nuttall Stand was opened on New Year's Day 1907. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Blackburn Rovers were still considered a top side in the English league. They were First Division champions in 1911–12 and 1913–14, and F.A Cup winners in <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20FA%20Cup">1927–28</a> with a 3–1 victory against <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, but the F.A Cup win was their last major trophy for nearly 70 years.
Mid 20th century.
Blackburn Rovers maintained a respectable mid-table position in the First Division until they were finally relegated (along with Aston Villa) from the top flight (for the first time since the foundation of the league) in the 1935–36 season.
When the league resumed after the war, Blackburn Rovers were relegated in their second season (1947–48). At this time the tradition of <a href="Burial%20of%20the%20Coffin">burying a coffin</a> began. The club remained in the second division for the following ten years. After promotion in 1958, they again returned to the mid-table position they had occupied in the earlier part of the century. During this time, they seldom made a serious challenge for a major trophy – although they did reach the <a href="1960%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1960 FA Cup Final</a> when managed by Scot <a href="Dally%20Duncan">Dally Duncan</a>. Rovers lost this game 3–0 to <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> after playing most of the game with only 10 men on the field following an injury to <a href="Dave%20Whelan">Dave Whelan</a>, who broke a leg.
There were brief hopes of a return to glory in the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20in%20English%20football">1963–64 season</a>, when a remarkable 8–2 away win over <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in east London on <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> took them to the top of the league. However, their lead of the league was short-lived, and they finished the season some way down the table, as the title was seized by a <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> side who would record a further 12 league titles over the next 26 years, while Blackburn's fortunes took a very different route. They were relegated from the First Division in 1966 and began a 26-year exile from the top division.
1970s and 1980s.
During the 1970s, Blackburn Rovers bounced between the Second and Third Divisions, winning the Third Division title in 1975, but never mounted a challenge for promotion to the First Division despite the efforts of successive managers to put the club back on track, and fell back into the Third Division in 1979. They went up as runners-up in the Third Division in 1980 and, save for one season in League One in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.%20season">2017–18</a>, have remained in the upper two tiers of the English league ever since. A second successive promotion was nearly achieved the following year, but the club missed out on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>, and promotion-winning manager <a href="Howard%20Kendall">Howard Kendall</a> moved to Everton that summer. Kendall's successor, <a href="Bobby%20Saxton">Bobby Saxton</a> only managed mid-table finishes for the next three seasons, then nearly achieved promotion in the 1984–85 season, but a poor finish the following year (just one place above relegation) followed by an abysmal start to the 1986–87 season cost Saxton his job.
Saxton was replaced by <a href="Don%20Mackay">Don Mackay</a>, who steered them to a decent finish that season and also victory in the <a href="Full%20Members%20Cup">Full Members Cup</a>. In the following three seasons Mackay re-established Rovers as promotion contenders, but they fell just short of promotion each time; the closest they came was in 1988–89 reached the Second Division play-off final in its last season of the home-away two-legged format – but lost to Crystal Palace. A defeat in the 1989–90 Second Division playoff semi-finals brought more frustration to Ewood Park, but the following season saw the club taken over by local steelworks owner and lifelong supporter <a href="Jack%20Walker">Jack Walker</a> (1929–2000).
1990s.
Following the Walker takeover Rovers finished 19th in the Second Division at the end of the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1990–91</a> season, but the new owner had made millions of pounds available to spend on new players and appointed <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> as manager in October 1991. Rovers secured promotion to the new <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a> at the end of <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92 season</a> as play-off winners, ending 26 years outside the top flight.
Rovers made headlines in the summer of 1992 by paying an English record fee of £3.5million for the 22-year-old Southampton and England centre forward <a href="Alan%20Shearer">Alan Shearer</a>. After finishing fourth in <a href="1992-93%20FA%20Premier%20League">1992–93</a> and runners-up in <a href="1993-94%20FA%20Premier%20League">1993–94</a>, they went on to win the Premier League title in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95</a>. The title chase went down to the last game of the season, but despite Rovers losing to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> they edged out rivals <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> to win the championship.
Kenny Dalglish moved upstairs to the position of Director of Football at the end of the Premier League winning season, and handed over the reins to his assistant <a href="Ray%20Harford">Ray Harford</a>. Blackburn Rovers made a poor start to the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96</a> season, and found themselves in the bottom half for most of the first half of the season. Rovers also struggled in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> and finished bottom of their group with just four points. 
A poor start to the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1996–97</a> Premier League campaign saw Harford resign in late October with the club bottom of the division, having failed to win any of their first ten games. Relegation looked a real possibility, just two seasons after winning the league. After an abortive attempt to bring in <a href="Sven-G%C3%B6ran%20Eriksson">Sven-Göran Eriksson</a> as manager, long-serving coach <a href="Tony%20Parkes">Tony Parkes</a> took over as manager for the rest of the campaign, narrowly steering the side to survival. That summer, the manager's job was taken by <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a>, who joined the club from <a href="Internazionale">Internazionale</a>. <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> football was secured with a 6th-place finish. However, Rovers made a poor start to the 1998–99 campaign and Hodgson was sacked in December less than an hour after a 2–0 home defeat by bottom side <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>, a result that locked Rovers in the relegation zone. He was replaced as manager by <a href="Brian%20Kidd">Brian Kidd</a>. However Kidd failed to save Rovers from relegation.
2000s.
In <a href="1999%E2%80%9300%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a> Rovers began the season as promotion favourites, but with the club hovering just above the Division One relegation zone <a href="Brian%20Kidd">Brian Kidd</a> was sacked in October and replaced in March by <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a>. <a href="Jack%20Walker">Jack Walker</a> died just after the start of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01 season</a>, and the club dedicated its promotion challenge in memory of their benefactor. Fittingly, they returned to the Premier League after a much improved season, finishing second behind <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>.
In <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">2001–02</a>, record signing <a href="Andy%20Cole">Andy Cole</a> was bought in for £8million, and Rovers won their first-ever <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> by beating <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 2–1 at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, Cole scoring the winner in the 69th minute. The following season Rovers finished sixth to qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> for the second season running. Souness left just after the start of <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">2004–05</a> to take charge at <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle</a>, and he was replaced by Welsh national coach <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a>. Hughes secured Rovers' Premier League survival for the 2004–05 season as well as an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-final against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, with Rovers finishing 15th once again. He led the team to sixth the following season and Rovers's third European qualification in five years.
Rovers reached the semi-final of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20FA%20Cup">2006–07 FA Cup</a>, but lost to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in extra time, and finished that season's league in tenth, qualifying for the <a href="Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a>, which led to a short run in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">2007–08 UEFA Cup</a>. In May 2008, Mark Hughes left Blackburn Rovers for the vacancy at <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. He was replaced by <a href="Paul%20Ince">Paul Ince</a>, whose first job was to persuade some of the wantaway players to stay. with <a href="Archie%20Knox">Archie Knox</a> coming in as his assistant. Ince's time in charge started well, but following a run of eleven games without a win he was sacked in December 2008. <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> was appointed as Ince's replacement and in 2009–10 he led the team to a tenth-place finish and a League Cup semi-final.
2010 onwards.
In November 2010, the Indian company <a href="V%20H%20Group">V H Group</a> bought Blackburn Rovers under the name of Venky's London Limited for £23 million. The new owners immediately sacked manager <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> and replaced him with first-team coach <a href="Steve%20Kean">Steve Kean</a>, initially on a temporary basis, but by January 2011 he had been awarded a full-time contract until June 2013. Kean's appointment was shrouded in controversy since his agent <a href="Jerome%20Anderson%20%28football%20agent%29">Jerome Anderson</a> had earlier played a major role in advising Venky's during the takeover of the club in the preceding months.
In December 2011, Blackburn Rovers posted an annual pre-tax loss of £18.6m for the year ending 30 June 2011. Despite this, the owners of Blackburn Rovers provided assurances over the continued funding of the club, even if they were relegated.
On 7 May 2012, Blackburn were relegated to the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> after being defeated at home by <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> in the penultimate game of the season, ending eleven years in the Premier League. At the start of the 2012–2013 season, Kean was given a chance by the owners to win promotion and kept his job as the manager. Ultimately though, pressure from the supporters who had been calling for the manager's removal for months resulted in his resignation as manager on 29 September 2012.
On 7 May 2017, Blackburn were relegated to League One. On 24 April 2018, the club were promoted back to the second tier with a 1–0 win at <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a>.
In recent years, they have finished 15th (2018–2019), 11th (2019–2020), 15th (2020–2021), 8th (2021–2022), and 7th (2022–2023) in the Championship.

Team colours and badge.
Unlike most teams, Blackburn Rovers have only ever had one design to their home kit. The distinctive blue and white halved jersey is widely acknowledged as the "town colour". Although the design has remained the same, the side in which the colours fall has often changed. Blue has resided on the wearers left since 1946 however prior to this regulation the blue and white often switched order almost yearly.
Blackburn Rovers' first ever kit is however indefinite. The 1905 book; Book of Football by Jonathan Russell describes Blackburn Rovers' first kit as a white jersey with Maltese Cross on the wearers left breast, Trousers and a blue and white skull cap. The Maltese Cross notorious with the public schools in which the founders of the club were educated. In contrast an account from the "Blackburn Standard" on 6 January 1894 accounts the first kit as navy blue and white quartered jersey (quartered accounting for the shirts four panels front and back), white knickers and navy hose. This account is much more synonymous with the kit today. Photographic evidence from 1878 shows the team in Blue and white halved (quartered) jerseys, white shorts and blue socks, complete with blue and white cap and Maltese Cross.
Through its history the club has adopted four badges as its crest; the Maltese Cross, the towns coat of arms, Lancashire Rose and the present day Blackburn Rovers Badge. From 1875 to approximately 1882 The Maltese Cross was present on the club's first ever home kit and was worn by both the Shrewsbury and Malvern school teams. Two former Malvernians and two former Salopians played in that first team, so there is a clear link with these public schools.
During FA Cup finals it is tradition for the club to adopt the town's coat of arms as their badge. This tradition has carried through all eight FA Cup finals the club has been a part of all the way to their last FA Cup final against Woverhampton Wanderers in 1960.
From roughly 1882 and excluding cup finals the club did not use a badge until 1974. In this year the club opted for an embroidered Lancashire Rose with the club's initials "B.R.F.C." below. This badge lasted unchanged for 15 years until it was 1989 due to visibility issues of the dark red rose on the dark blue of the shirt.
From 1989 to the present day the current Blackburn Rovers badge has been used. It has encompassed the previous badge in a newer design for the Lancashire Red Rose. Circling the rose is the team name "Blackburn Rovers F.C." and the date in which the club was founded "1875". At the base of the badge is the club motto, "Arte Et Labore" which translated means, "by skill and by labour". This motto has been taken from the town motto which was adopted in 1852.
Kit.
As of 2021, the club's kit has been manufactured by <a href="Macron%20%28sportswear%29">Macron</a>, and sponsored by <a href="Electronic%20cigarette">vaping</a> brand, Totally Wicked, since January 2022.
Grounds.
Oozehead Ground 1875–1877.
Rovers first home ground was a field at Oozehead on Preston New Road to the north west of the town. This field was farmland and was owned by a local farmer; when Blackburn Rovers weren't using the field it was used to graze cows. In the centre of the field was a large watering hole, which on match days was covered with timber and turf.
Pleasington Cricket Ground 1877.
Due to the rough conditions at Oozehead, the committee felt an established sports ground would be best to play on. Therefore, during the 1877 season they acquired the use of Pleasington's cricket ground to the south west of the town. Play stopped on this ground after Henry Smith of Preston North End died of a heart attack whilst playing.
Alexandra Meadows 1877–1881.
Still adopting cricket grounds, the committee acquired the use of the East Lancashire Cricket Club's ground in the centre of the town, Alexandra Meadows. Sources differ as to the date of the first match played by Rovers at Alexandra Meadows. A programme from <a href="Clitheroe%20F.C.">Clitheroe F.C.</a> states that Clitheroe was the first team to beat Blackburn at Alexandra Meadows on 17 November 1877. Other sources indicate that the first match took place on 2 January 1878 with a Blackburn victory against <a href="Partick%20Thistle%20F.C.">Partick Thistle</a>. It was on this ground Blackburn Rovers played for the first time under artificial light against Accrington on 4 November 1878.
Leamington Road 1881–1890.
Due to the increasing demand in football in the area and in particular for Blackburn Rovers the committee felt that a private ground was more fitting. Therefore, in 1881 the club moved to Leamington Road, Blackburn Rovers' first purpose built ground including a 700-person capacity seated grandstand, costing £500. The first game played at this ground was held on 8 October 1881 against Blackburn Olympic resulting in a 4–1 win for Rovers. Whilst at Leamington Road and under James Fielding the club won three FA Cups and was inaugurated into the Football League as a founding Member in 1888. However, despite the club's success, they had to leave Leamington Road due to increases in lease costs.
Ewood Park 1890–present.
Built in April 1882 as Ewood Bridge. The ground was an all purpose sporting venue hosting football, athletics and dog racing. The Blackburn Rovers committee felt this was the ideal venue for the club after having already played numerous games there in 1882. The first game played at the new Ewood Park ground was on 13 September 1890 against Accrington, the 0–0 draw was viewed by 10,000 people and on 31 October 1892 artificial lights were installed. Ewood sits on the bank of the <a href="River%20Darwen">River Darwen</a> in <a href="Blackburn%2C%20Lancashire">Blackburn, Lancashire</a>.
1913 terrorist incident.
An attempt was made to destroy the ground in 1913. As part of the <a href="suffragette%20bombing%20and%20arson%20campaign">suffragette bombing and arson campaign</a>, <a href="suffragettes">suffragettes</a> carried out a series of bombings and arson attacks nationwide to publicise their campaign for women's suffrage. In November 1913, suffragettes attempted to burn down Ewood Park's grandstand but were foiled. In the same year, suffragettes <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%23Stadium%20destruction%20and%20move%20to%20North%20London">succeeded in burning down</a> <a href="Arsenal%20FC">Arsenal</a>'s then South London stadium, and also attempted to burn down <a href="Preston%20North%20End">Preston North End</a>'s ground. More traditionally male sports were targeted in order to protest against <a href="patriarchy">male dominance</a>.
Supporters and rivalries.
Blackburn Rovers supporters have formed several support clubs related to the team, and almost all of them are partially focused on making trips to Ewood Park easier. Rovers home games were well attended as a percentage of the Blackburn population throughout the 2000s with average attendances of around 25,000, equal to roughly a quarter of Blackburn's population (approximately 100,000). The supporters' long-running fanzine is called "<a href="A%20Day%20in%20the%20Life">4,000 Holes</a>".
<a href="Clement%20Charnock">Clement Charnock</a> and his brother <a href="Harry%20Charnock">Harry</a> were Blackburn Rovers fans who introduced football into <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Russia</a> in the 1880s.

Other rivalries for Rovers include <a href="Preston%20North%20End">Preston North End</a>, <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers">Bolton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Wigan%20Athletic">Wigan Athletic</a>, all by proximity.

Bolton Wanderers F.C.

Bolton Wanderers Football Club ( ) is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Horwich">Horwich</a>, <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England. The team competes in <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a>, the third level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. 
Formed as Christ Church Football Club in 1874, it adopted its current name in 1877 and was a founding member of the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1888. The club moved between the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> and the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> eight times in thirteen seasons between 1899 and 1911, winning the Second Division title in 1908–09. Bolton won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> three times in the 1920s: in <a href="1923%20FA%20Cup%20final">1923</a> – the "White Horse Final", <a href="1926%20FA%20Cup%20final">1926</a> and <a href="1929%20FA%20Cup%20final">1929</a>; they had finished as runners-up in <a href="1894%20FA%20Cup%20final">1894</a> and <a href="1904%20FA%20Cup%20final">1904</a>. The club spent just two seasons outside the top-flight between 1911 and 1964, having won promotion from the Second Division at the second attempt at the end of the 1934–35 season. They lost the <a href="1953%20FA%20Cup%20final">1953 FA Cup final</a> and then won the competition for a fourth time in <a href="1958%20FA%20Cup%20final">1958</a> under the stewardship of <a href="Bill%20Ridding">Bill Ridding</a>. Bolton were relegated in 1964 and again in 1971, but regained their top-flight status after winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> title in 1972–73 and then the Second Division title in 1977–78. However, three relegations left them in the fourth tier by 1987, though promotion out of the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> was secured in 1987–88 and they lifted the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> in <a href="1989%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup%20final">1989</a> after being beaten finalists in <a href="1986%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup%20final">1986</a>.
Promotions in 1992–93 and 1994–95 saw them reach the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. Bolton won the First Division title in 1996–97, but were unable to survive more than one season in the Premier League until <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> returned them to the top-flight with victory in the <a href="2001%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">2001 First Division play-off final</a>. Bolton then spent eleven consecutive seasons in the Premier League, reaching the <a href="2004%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2004 League Cup final</a> and reaching the knock-out stages of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> twice. However, two relegations in five years left them in <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> by 2016, and though they won promotion in 2016–17, severe financial difficulties saw the club enter <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> in May 2019 after relegation back into the third tier was confirmed. Facing possible EFL expulsion and probable extinction, the club was acquired by new owners on 28 August 2019. Relegated to the fourth tier in 2020, they won promotion out of <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> in the 2020–21 season and won the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">EFL Trophy</a> in the 2022–23 season.
From 1895 to 1997, the club played at <a href="Burnden%20Park">Burnden Park</a> after moving from their original home at <a href="Pike%27s%20Lane">Pike's Lane</a>. Since 1997, Bolton have played home matches at the <a href="Toughsheet%20Community%20Stadium">Toughsheet Community Stadium</a>. They have spent 73 seasons in the top-flight without winning the title; more than any other club.
History.
Early history (1877–1929).
The club was founded by the Reverend <a href="Joseph%20Farrall%20Wright">Joseph Farrall Wright</a>, <a href="Perpetual%20curate">Perpetual curate</a> of Christ Church Bolton, and Thomas Ogden, the schoolmaster at the adjacent church school, in 1874 as Christ Church F.C. It was initially run from the church of the same name on Deane Road, Bolton, on the site where the Innovation factory of the <a href="University%20of%20Bolton">University of Bolton</a> now stands. The club left the location following a dispute with the vicar, and changed its name to Bolton Wanderers in 1877. The name was chosen as the club initially had a lot of difficulty finding a permanent ground to play on, having used three venues in its first four years of existence.
Bolton were one of the 12 founder members of the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a>, which formed in 1888. At the time <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> was one of the strongest footballing regions in the country, with 6 of the 12 founder clubs coming from within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire. Having remained in the Football League since its formation, Bolton have spent more time in the top flight (<a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>/old <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>) than out of it.
In 1894 Bolton reached the final of the FA Cup for the first time, but <a href="1894%20FA%20Cup%20final">lost 4–1</a> to <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a>. A decade later they were runners-up a second time, <a href="1904%20FA%20Cup%20final">losing 1–0</a> to local rivals <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre">Crystal Palace</a> on 23 April 1904.
The period before and after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> was Bolton's most consistent period of top-flight success as measured by league finishes, with the club finishing outside the top 8 of the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> on only two occasions between <a href="1911%E2%80%9312%20in%20English%20football">1911–12</a> and <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20in%20English%20football">1927–28</a>. In this period Bolton equalled their record finish of third twice, in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">1920–21</a> and <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20in%20English%20football">1924–25</a>, on the latter occasion missing out on the title by just 3 points (in an era of 2 points for a win).
On 28 April 1923, Bolton won their first major trophy in their third final, beating <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> 2–0 in the first ever <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> FA Cup final. The match, famously known as <a href="1923%20FA%20Cup%20final">The White Horse final</a> was played in front of over 127,000 supporters. Bolton's centre-forward, <a href="David%20Jack%20%28footballer%29">David Jack</a> scored the first ever goal at Wembley Stadium. Driven by long-term players <a href="Joe%20Smith%20%28football%20forward%2C%20born%201889%29">Joe Smith</a> in attack, <a href="Ted%20Vizard">Ted Vizard</a> and <a href="Billy%20Butler%20%28footballer%29">Billy Butler</a> on the wings, and <a href="Jimmy%20Seddon">Jimmy Seddon</a> in defence, they became the most successful cup side of the twenties, winning three times. Their second victory of the decade came in <a href="1926%20FA%20Cup%20final">1926</a>, beating Manchester City 1–0 in front of over 91,000 spectators, and the third came in <a href="1929%20FA%20Cup%20final">1929</a> as <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> were beaten 2–0 in front of nearly 93,000 fans.
In 1928 the club faced financial difficulties and so was forced to sell David Jack to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> to raise funds. Despite the pressure to sell, the agreed fee of £10,890 was a world record, more than double the previous most expensive transfer of a player.
Top flight run and cup success (1929–1958).
From 1935 to 1964, Bolton enjoyed an uninterrupted stay in the top flight – regarded by fans as a golden era – spearheaded in the 1950s by <a href="Nat%20Lofthouse">Nat Lofthouse</a>. The years of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> saw most of the Wanderers' playing staff see action on the front, a rare occurrence within elite football, as top sportsmen were generally assigned to physical training assignments, away from enemy fire. However, 15 Bolton professionals, led by their captain <a href="Harry%20Goslin">Harry Goslin</a>, volunteered for active service in 1939, and enlisted in the <a href="53rd%20%28Bolton%29%20Field%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">53rd (Bolton) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery</a>. By the end of the war, 32 of the 35 pre-war professionals saw action in the British forces. The sole fatality was Goslin, who had by then risen to the rank of Lieutenant and was killed by shrapnel on the Italian front shortly before Christmas 1943. 53rd Bolton Artillery took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dunkirk">Battle of Dunkirk</a> and also served in the campaigns of Egypt, Iraq and Italy. Remarkably, a number of these soldiers managed to carry on playing the game in these theatres of war, taking on as 'British XI' various scratch teams assembled by, among others, <a href="Farouk%20of%20Egypt">King Farouk of Egypt</a> in Cairo and Polish forces in Baghdad.
On 9 March 1946, the club's home was the scene of the <a href="Burnden%20Park%20disaster">Burnden Park disaster</a>, which at the time was the worst tragedy in British <a href="Association%20football">football</a> history. 33 Bolton Wanderers fans were crushed to death, and another 400 injured, in an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> quarter-final second leg tie between Bolton and <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a>. There was an estimated 67,000-strong crowd crammed in for the game, though other estimates vary widely, with a further 15,000 locked out as it became clear the stadium was full. The disaster led to <a href="Ronw%20Moelwyn%20Hughes">Moelwyn Hughes</a>'s official report, which recommended more rigorous control of crowd sizes.
In 1953 Bolton played in one of the most famous FA Cup finals of all time – <a href="1953%20FA%20Cup%20final">The Stanley Matthews final</a> of 1953. Bolton lost the game to <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> 4–3 after gaining a 3–1 lead. Blackpool were victorious thanks to the skills of <a href="Stanley%20Matthews">Matthews</a> and the goals of <a href="Stan%20Mortensen">Stan Mortensen</a>.
Bolton Wanderers have not won a major trophy since 1958, when two Lofthouse goals saw them overcome <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the <a href="1958%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> in front of a 100,000 crowd at Wembley Stadium. The closest they have come to winning a major trophy since then is finishing runners-up in the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a>, first in 1995 and again in 2004.
Few highs and many lows (1958–1995).
While Bolton finished fourth the following season, the next 20 years would prove to be a fallow period. The club suffered relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20in%20English%20football">1963–64</a>, and were then relegated again to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for the first time in their history in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">1970–71</a>. This stay in the Third Division lasted just two years before the club were promoted as champions in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20in%20English%20football">1972–73</a>. Hopes were high at Burnden Park in May 1978 when Bolton sealed the Second Division title and gained promotion to the First Division. However, they only remained there for two seasons before being relegated.
Following relegation in 1980, Bolton signed up talented striker <a href="Brian%20Kidd">Brian Kidd</a>, as they prepared to challenge for a quick return to the First Division. Kidd scored a hat-trick in his third game for Bolton, a 4–0 win over <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> in the league, but the rest of the season was a struggle as Bolton finished close to the relegation places. By the end of the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20in%20English%20football">1981–82 season</a>, Bolton were no closer to promotion and had lost several key players including <a href="Peter%20Reid">Peter Reid</a> and <a href="Neil%20Whatmore">Neil Whatmore</a>. The following season Bolton were relegated to the Third Division after losing 4–1 at <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> on the final day.
Despite a new-look, much younger team and an 8–1 win over <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a>, Bolton's best league win for 50 years, Bolton failed to win promotion in the 1983–84 season, and would remain in the Third Division for another three seasons. In 1986 <a href="Nat%20Lofthouse">Nat Lofthouse</a> was appointed President of the football club, a position he would hold until his death on 15 January 2011. At the end of the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87 season</a>, Bolton Wanderers suffered relegation to the Fourth Division for the first time in their history, but won promotion back to the Third Division at the first attempt. The club won the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Sherpa Van Trophy</a> in <a href="1989%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20final">1989</a>, defeating <a href="Torquay%20United%20F.C.">Torquay United</a> 4–1. During the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1990–91</a> season, Bolton were pipped to the final automatic promotion place by <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a> and lost to <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere Rovers</a> in the play-off final, but they failed to build on this and the following season saw the club finish 13th.
The early 1990s saw Bolton gain a giant-killing reputation in cup competitions. In 1993 Bolton beat FA Cup holders <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> 2–0 in a third round replay at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>, thanks to goals from <a href="John%20McGinlay">John McGinlay</a> and <a href="Andy%20Walker%20%28footballer%20born%201965%29">Andy Walker</a>. The club also defeated higher division opposition in the form of <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> (2–1) that year before bowing out to <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>. Bolton also secured promotion to the second tier for the first time since 1983. In 1994 Bolton again beat FA Cup holders, this time in the form of <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, 3–1 after extra time in a fourth round replay, and went on to reach the quarter-finals, bowing out 1–0 at home to local rivals (and then Premiership) <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a>. Bolton also defeated top division opposition in the form of <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> (3–2) and <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> (1–0) that year.
Return to the top flight and venture into Europe (1995–2012).
Bolton reached the Premiership in 1995 thanks to a 4–3 victory over <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> in the <a href="1995%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">Division One play-off final</a>. Reading took a 2–0 lead before a Keith Branagan penalty save in the 42nd minute changed the course of the game. Bolton scored two late goals to take the game to extra time, scoring twice more before a late Reading consolation. The same year Bolton progressed to the <a href="1995%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">League Cup final</a>, but were defeated 2–1 by Liverpool. Bolton were bottom for virtually all of the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96</a> Premiership campaign and were relegated as they lost their penultimate game 1–0 to <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>.
The club won promotion back to the Premiership at the first attempt thanks to a season in which they achieved 98 league points and 100 goals in the process of securing the Division One championship, the first time since 1978 that they had finished top of any division. This season also marked the club's departure from Burnden Park to the Reebok Stadium, the last game at the stadium being a 4–1 win over Charlton Athletic.
Bolton were relegated on goal difference at the end of the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a> Premiership campaign. They finished on the same number of points as Everton, whom they faced in the first competitive match at the newly built Reebok Stadium. The game finished 0–0, but a goal by Gerry Taggart for the Whites was mistakenly not given; the point swing in Bolton's favour would have kept them up. The following season they reached the <a href="1999%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">1999 Division One play-off final</a> but lost 2–0 to <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>.
In 2000 Bolton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, Worthington Cup and play-offs but lost on penalties to Aston Villa, 4–0 <a href="two-legged%20tie">on aggregate</a> to Tranmere Rovers and 7–5 on aggregate to <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> respectively. In <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a> Bolton were promoted back to the Premiership after beating Preston North End 3–0 in the <a href="2001%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a>.
Bolton struggled in the following two seasons, but survived in the Premiership. The 2001–02 season began with a shock victory as they destroyed <a href="Leicester%20City">Leicester</a> 5–0 at <a href="Filbert%20Street">Filbert Street</a>. They then followed the win with two more over <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> and Liverpool to go top of the top flight table for the first time since 1891. Despite a 2–1 win away at Manchester United, becoming the first team since the formation of the Premiership to come from behind and win a league game at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28football%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a>, they went into a deep slump during the middle of the season and needed a <a href="Fredi%20Bobic">Fredi Bobic</a> <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> against Ipswich Town to survive. Despite losing the final three games, 16th place was secured. The 2002–03 season began with a poor start and, despite another win away at Manchester United, they were bottom until a 4–2 win against <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> at <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a>. Despite suffering from a lack of consistency, Bolton achieved the results needed and secured survival in a final day 2–1 victory over Middlesbrough.
Bolton reached the League Cup final in 2004, but <a href="2004%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">lost</a> 2–1 to Middlesbrough. Nevertheless, the club finished eighth in the league, at the time the highest finish in their Premiership history.
In 2005, Bolton finished sixth in the league, thus earning qualification for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> for the first time in their history. The following season, they reached the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup%23Round%20of%2032">last 32</a> but were eliminated by French team <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a> as they lost 2–1 on aggregate. Between 2003–04 and 2006–07, Bolton recorded consecutive top-eight finishes, a record of consistency bettered only by the big four of <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Towards the end of the 06–07 season, long-serving manager Sam Allardyce departed the club, stating that he was taking a sabbatical; he would be hired shortly thereafter as manager of Newcastle United. Allardyce later cited a lack of ambition on the part of the club's board for his departure; he had sought financial backing in January 2007 to push the club towards Champions League qualification, which he had not received.
The 2007–08 season saw Bolton survive with a 16th-place finish, their safety being confirmed on the final day of the season, as they went on an unbeaten run for their final five games, as well as getting to the last sixteen of the UEFA Cup. Former assistant manager Sammy Lee replaced Allardyce as manager, but a poor start to the season saw him replaced by Gary Megson. During the European run, Bolton gained an unexpected 2–2 draw against former European champions <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, as well as becoming the first English team to beat <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> in Belgrade. They also defeated <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> on aggregate before being knocked out by <a href="Sporting%20CP">Sporting Lisbon</a>.
Bolton broke their record transfer fee with the signing of <a href="Johan%20Elmander">Johan Elmander</a> from <a href="Toulouse%20FC">Toulouse</a> on 27 June 2008, in a deal which cost the club a reported £8.2 million and saw Norwegian striker <a href="Daniel%20Braaten">Daniel Braaten</a> head in the opposite direction. Megson was replaced part-way through the 2009–2010 season by former Wanderers striker Owen Coyle, after Megson endured a difficult relationship with the fans. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20FA%20Cup">2010–11 FA Cup</a>, Bolton progressed all the way to the semi-finals, but were beaten 5–0 by Stoke at Wembley, with the match being described as "a massive anti-climax".
The <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20in%20English%20football">following season</a> began as the previous one had ended with just one win and six defeats, their worst start since the <a href="1902%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">1902–03 season</a> when they were relegated. On 17 March 2012, manager <a href="Owen%20Coyle">Owen Coyle</a> travelled to the <a href="London%20Chest%20Hospital">London Chest Hospital</a> with <a href="Fabrice%20Muamba">Fabrice Muamba</a> who had suffered from a cardiac arrest whilst playing against <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> at <a href="White%20Hart%20Lane">White Hart Lane</a> in a <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> match. Muamba stayed in a critical condition for several weeks and Coyle was widely praised for the manner in which he represented the club during the period. That 13 May, Bolton were relegated to the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> by one point on the last day of the season after drawing 2–2 with <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a>.
Return to the Championship (2012–2018).
The following season back in the Championship started badly for Bolton, with only three wins in ten league matches and a second round exit from the League Cup following a loss at <a href="Crawley%20Town">Crawley Town</a>. As a result of poor performances leaving them in 16th place, Bolton sacked Coyle on 9 October 2012, replacing him with <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>'s <a href="Dougie%20Freedman">Dougie Freedman</a>. They finished in seventh place, losing out on a play-off place to <a href="Leicester%20City">Leicester City</a> on goal difference. The 2013–14 began with a trip to <a href="Turf%20Moor">Turf Moor</a>, in celebration of the 125th anniversary of the Football League. Freedman was fired after a torrid run of results at the beginning of the 2014–2015 season; he was replaced by former Celtic manager <a href="Neil%20Lennon">Neil Lennon</a>, who promptly won his first game in charge 1–0 away at Birmingham.
In December 2015, Bolton, who were £172.9 million in debt, were handed a winding-up petition from <a href="HM%20Revenue%20and%20Customs">HM Revenue and Customs</a> over unpaid taxes, and a <a href="Transfer%20%28association%20football%29%23Transfer%20bans">transfer embargo</a> for the following month's window. Much of this debt owed to former owner <a href="Edwin%20Davies">Eddie Davies</a> was confirmed to have been written off in March 2018, to assist with the club's potential sale prospects. After ending a 17-game winless run, Lennon, who had been investigated by the club due to allegations about his personal life, said that the club had "been through hell". On 18 January 2016, the club avoided an immediate winding-up order after their case was adjourned until 22 February to give it time to either close a deal with a potential buyer or raise sufficient short-term funds from asset sales. The club was said to owe HM Revenue and Customs £2.2m. The financial situation had improved as a takeover bid by <a href="Dean%20Holdsworth">Dean Holdsworth</a>'s Sports Shield was successful in March 2016. Lennon was removed from his position for the final few games of the season, replaced by Academy manager Jimmy Phillips. On 9 April 2016, Bolton lost 4–1 away at <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> to confirm their relegation to the <a href="EFL%20League%20One">third tier</a> for the first time since 1993.
Under new manager <a href="Phil%20Parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a>, Bolton won promotion from League One at the first time of asking with a second-place finish. On 14 September 2017, the board announced that the embargo was over. Bolton started their first season back in the Championship poorly, only earning their first victory in October. Their form improved mid-season, however going into the final round of fixtures Bolton were in the relegation zone, needing a win to stand a chance of securing survival. They achieved this to finish 21st, narrowly avoiding relegation, having fought back from 2–1 down to win 3–2 at home against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in the last ten minutes of their final match of the season.
Relegation and financial crisis (2018–2019).
Throughout the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20EFL%20Championship">2018–19 Championship</a> season Bolton faced financial difficulties. On 12 September 2018, Bolton reached an agreement with their main creditor BluMarble Capital Ltd over an unpaid loan, avoiding administration and a points deduction from the EFL. Bolton were served a winding-up order on 27 September 2018 after failing to make a payment to HM Revenue and Customs. This was the fourth such petition the club had faced in the previous 14 months. After the collapse of the permanent signing of on-loan striker <a href="Christian%20Doidge">Christian Doidge</a>, <a href="Forest%20Green%20Rovers%20F.C.">Forest Green Rovers</a> commenced legal action over lost earnings. In February 2019, Bolton were again issued a winding-up petition by HMRC which was subsequently adjourned until the end of the season as their search for a new owner continued. The match against <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> on 26 April was called off by the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> 16 hours before kick off after Bolton's players, supported by the <a href="Professional%20Footballers%27%20Association">Professional Footballers' Association</a>, refused to play until they had received their unpaid wages; the EFL awarded the win to Brentford. The Bolton Whites Hotel, owned by Ken Anderson, was also issued with a winding-up petition in March 2019 (it closed on 1 May and went into administration on 14 May). The team was relegated to League One in April after a 23rd-place finish.
In May 2019, the club went into <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> due to a £1.2m unpaid tax bill, incurring a 12-point penalty for the 2019–2020 season. Fildraw (former owner <a href="Edwin%20Davies">Eddie Davies</a>' trust fund) appointed administrators from insolvency firm David Rubin and Partners. A 17 July statement from the Bolton players said that no-one at the club had been paid by owner Ken Anderson for 20 weeks, the training ground had no potable drinking water nor hot water for showers. Pre-season friendlies were cancelled as Bolton could not give assurances about fielding a competitive team.
Anderson failed to find a buyer before the start of the season, and Bolton started their opening League One game on 3 August at <a href="Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wycombe Wanderers</a> with only three contracted senior outfield players, and lost 2–0. A week later, Bolton fielded its youngest ever side, with an average age of 19, in a goalless home draw against <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>. Manager Phil Parkinson expressed concern about the welfare of the youth players used in all of Bolton's games, leading Bolton to postpone the game against <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a> on 20 August but without informing either Doncaster or the EFL.
Parkinson and assistant Steve Parkin resigned the following day, with academy manager Jimmy Phillips taking interim charge. On 26 August, it was announced that the takeover by Football Ventures had fallen through one day before the EFL deadline, potentially risking the club going into <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a>. After Bolton failed to meet that deadline, the suspension of its notice of withdrawal from the EFL was lifted; however, the club was not immediately expelled from the EFL – it was given until 12 September 2019 to meet all outstanding requirements of the League's insolvency policy.
Under new ownership (2019–).
On 28 August, Bolton announced that the club's sale to Football Ventures (Whites) Limited had been completed, with the administrator paying tribute to the Eddie Davies Trust and their legal team, and criticising Ken Anderson who had "used his position as a secured creditor to hamper and frustrate any deal that did not benefit him or suit his purposes." Days later, <a href="Keith%20Hill%20%28footballer%29">Keith Hill</a> was announced as the new club manager. He signed nine players before the transfer deadline closed, and his first win came on 22 October, 2–0 against <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>, Bolton's first win in 22 matches.
On 21 November 2019, Bolton were handed a five-point deduction, suspended for 18 months, and fined £70,000, half of which was suspended for 18 months, for failure to fulfil two fixtures (against Brentford and Doncaster). The points would not be deducted if Bolton fulfilled all fixtures during the 18-month period. An EFL appeal against what it saw as a "lenient" penalty was rejected by an arbitration panel in January 2020. On 9 June 2020, the <a href="EFL%20League%20One">EFL League One</a> decided to end the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20season">2019–20 season</a> early due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, causing bottom club Bolton Wanderers to go down to the <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">fourth tier of English football</a> for the first time since 1988 and only the second time in their history. Following relegation, the club announced that Keith Hill and assistant David Flitcroft would leave the club when their contracts expired at the end of June. <a href="Barrow%20A.F.C.">Barrow</a> manager <a href="Ian%20Evatt">Ian Evatt</a> was appointed Hill's successor on 1 July 2020. Despite being in 17th place after 24 matches, Bolton orchestrated an impressive season turnaround under Evatt. They completed the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.%20season">2020–21 League Two season</a> in third place after a 4–1 win against <a href="Crawley%20Town%20F.C.">Crawley Town</a> on the final day – enough to secure automatic promotion to League One – and early in the 2021–22 season settled debts with unsecured creditors to remove the threat of a 15-point deduction.
In January 2022, it was confirmed that the club had received an emergency loan from The Future Fund, a financial support scheme set up during the <a href="COVID-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic. This was subsequently converted into shares of the club, with around 8% of shares now owned by the <a href="British%20Business%20Bank">British Business Bank</a>, an economic development bank developed and run by <a href="HM%20Government">HM Government</a>.
On 2 April 2023, Bolton won the <a href="2023%20EFL%20Trophy%20final">2023 EFL Trophy final</a> 4–0 win against <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a>.
Colours and badge.
Bolton Wanderers' home colours are white shirts with navy and red trim, traditionally worn with navy shorts and white socks. Their away kits have been varied over the years, with navy kits and yellow kits among the most popular and common. Bolton did not always wear a white kit; in 1884 they wore white with red spots, leading to the club's original nickname of "The Spots". The traditional navy blue shorts were dispensed with in 2003, in favour of an all-white strip, but they returned in 2008. The club had previously experimented with an all-white kit in the 1970s.
The Bolton Wanderers club badge consists of the initials of the club in the shape of a ball, with a red scroll and <a href="Red%20Rose%20of%20Lancaster">Lancashire rose</a> underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans as the red rose returned to the badge and those who saw the ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras meaning "Overcome Delays". This feature has been reincorporated on the back of some more recent club shirts which was seen as a nice touch by some.
The club's nickname of "The Trotters" has several claimed derivations; that it is simply a variation on "Wanderers", that it is an old local term for a practical joker, or that one of the grounds used before the club settled at Pikes Lane resided next to a piggery, causing players to have to "trot" through the pig pens to retrieve the ball if it went over the fence.
Grounds.
When the club was first founded, Christ Church had a nomadic existence, playing at a number of locations in the area. The club, which had by then been renamed Bolton Wanderers, started playing regularly at <a href="Pike%27s%20Lane">Pike's Lane</a> in 1881. Spending £150 on pitch improvements, season tickets cost a guinea. They played here for fourteen years until the tenancy expired and they moved to Burnden Park.
Situated in the <a href="Burnden">Burnden</a> area of Bolton, approximately one mile from the centre of the town, the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 to make way for a new <a href="United%20Co-operatives%23Normid">Normid</a> superstore. At this time, Bolton were in a dire position financially and were struggling in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Football League Third Division</a>, so there was a low demand for tickets and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.
By 1992 the club's directors had decided that it would be difficult to convert Burnden Park into an all-seater stadium for a club of Bolton's ambition, as the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> required all first- and second-tier clubs to do. A decision was made to build an out of town stadium in the town of Horwich, with the eventual location chosen 5 miles due west of the town centre. The stadium opened in August 1997, as a modern, <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a> with a capacity of around 29,000. In recognition of the club's former ground the stadium stands on "Burnden Way". It has four stands, though the lower-tier seating is one continuous bowl. It was originally known as the "Reebok Stadium" after long-time team <a href="sponsor%20%28commercial%29">sponsor</a>, <a href="Reebok">Reebok</a>. This was initially unpopular with many fans, as it was considered impersonal, and that too much emphasis was being placed on financial considerations. This opposition considerably lessened since the stadium was built. In April 2014, the stadium was renamed as part of a four-year deal with new sponsors <a href="Macron%20%28sportswear%29">Macron</a> sportswear. When this deal came to an end in August 2018 the stadium was again renamed, this time as the University of Bolton Stadium. In 2023, a new record-breaking stadium naming rights deal was announced with Bolton-based recyclable building products manufacturer Toughsheet, leading the stadium to be renamed the Toughsheet Community Stadium.
In 2014 the club established <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20Free%20School">Bolton Wanderers Free School</a> at the stadium, a <a href="sixth%20form">sixth form</a> offering sports and related courses for 16 to 19-year-olds. However, this was later closed in 2017 due to low pupil numbers which deemed it 'not financially viable'.
Rivalries and supporters.
Bolton Wanderers Supporters' Association (BWSA) is the official supporters' association of Bolton Wanderers Football Club. The Supporters' Association was formed in 1992, on the initiative of a fan, Peter Entwistle. Later that year the Directors of the football club, satisfied that the Association had proven itself to be organised and responsible, officially recognised Bolton Wanderers Supporters' Association as the club's supporters' group.
In 1997, shortly after the move from Burnden Park to the <a href="Reebok%20Stadium">Reebok Stadium</a>, the BWSA accepted the invitation from the football club to hold its monthly meetings at the new stadium. The Toughsheet Community Stadium has continued to be their venue ever since. In the year 2000, the Association expanded significantly when its invitation to affiliate was accepted by Bolton Wanderers supporters groups in other parts of Britain, and also by groups around the world. All of these foreign groups have come on board to become independent, but integral, parts of the official Bolton Wanderers supporters' family. Requests for affiliated status continue to be received regularly from other places around the world where Wanderers fans find themselves gather together.
Historically Bolton's traditional rivals were near neighbours <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>, though due to limited league meetings and Bury's expulsion from the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> in August 2019 the rivalry has lessened considerably. The club also has traditional rivalries with fellow Lancashire clubs <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> and <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>, as all three sides are separated by less than fifteen miles and are all founder members of <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>. More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Wigan eventually became known as Bolton biggest rivals, and crowd trouble marred the 16 October 2021 meeting between the two clubs. A study in 2021 found that the Bolton/Wigan rivalry was the most competitive in all of English Football history, with both teams having an identical record against each other at the time. Bolton fans also maintain a mutual dislike with the fans of nearby <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>, <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere Rovers</a>, 
According to a survey conducted in August 2019 entitled 'The League of Love and Hate', Bolton supporters named <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>, <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a> and <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a> as their biggest rivals.
Ownership and finances.
The holding company of Bolton Wanderers F.C. is Burnden Leisure Ltd, a <a href="private%20company%20limited%20by%20shares">private company limited by shares</a>. Burnden Leisure was previously a <a href="public%20limited%20company">public company</a> traded on the <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">AIM</a> <a href="stock%20exchange">stock exchange</a> until its voluntary delisting in May 2003 following <a href="Edwin%20Davies">Eddie Davies</a>'s takeover. The club itself is 100% owned by Burnden Leisure; businessman Davies owned 94.5% of the shares, with the remaining stakes held by over 6,000 small shareholders with less than 0.1% holding each. After Bolton exited the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, Davies revoked his investment into the club. This led to published debts of almost £200m and brought the club very close to being wound up over unpaid tax bills owed to <a href="HMRC">HMRC</a>. As a gesture of his goodwill and as incentive to sell the club, Davies promised to wipe over £125m of debt owed to him when the club was sold, which wiped a significant proportion of debt the club owed.
In March 2016, Sports Shield, a consortium led by Dean Holdsworth, bought Davies' controlling stake; a year later, Holdsworth shareholding in Sports Shield was bought out by Ken Anderson. Under Anderson, financial difficulties dogged the club, with player strikes, further winding up orders and financial disputes with other creditors. These culminated in the club (Burnden Leisure Ltd) going into administration in May 2019, and, with the club's future ownership unresolved, being threatened with expulsion from the EFL in August 2019. On 28 August, the club was sold to Football Ventures (Whites) Ltd despite opposition from Ken Anderson.
In January 2022, it was confirmed that the club had received an emergency loan from The Future Fund, a financial support scheme set up during the <a href="COVID-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic. This was subsequently converted into shares of the club, with around 8% of shares now owned by the <a href="British%20Business%20Bank">British Business Bank</a>, an economic development bank developed and run by <a href="HM%20Government">HM Government</a>.
Sponsorship.
Bolton Wanderers had a long-established partnership with sporting goods firm Reebok, which was formed in the town. Between 1997 and 2009 this partnership encompassed shirt sponsorship, kit manufacture and stadium naming rights. The combined shirt sponsorship (1990–2009) and kit manufacture (1993–2012) deals covering 22 years represent the longest kit partnership in English football history. The stadium's naming rights were held by Reebok from its opening in 1997 until 2014.
Bolton's kit manufacturer from the 2014–15 season changed to Italian sportswear brand <a href="Macron%20%28sportswear%29">Macron</a>, who also became stadium name sponsors for four years. In August 2018, the stadium naming rights went to the <a href="University%20of%20Bolton">University of Bolton</a> in an undisclosed deal. From 1 July 2023 it became known as the Toughsheet Community Stadium.

The club's <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Premier%20League">2015–16 Premier League</a> title win attracted global attention, and they became one of seven clubs to have won the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> since its <a href="Foundation%20of%20the%20Premier%20League">inception in 1992</a>.

History.
Founding and early years (1884–1949).
Formed in 1884 by a group of old boys of <a href="Wyggeston%20Grammar%20School%20for%20Boys">Wyggeston School</a> as "Leicester Fosse", the club joined <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> (FA) in 1890. Before moving to <a href="Filbert%20Street">Filbert Street</a> in 1891, the club played at five different grounds, including <a href="Victoria%20Park%2C%20Leicester">Victoria Park</a> south-east of the city centre and the <a href="Belgrave%20Road%20Cycle%20and%20Cricket%20Ground">Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground</a>. The club also joined the <a href="Midland%20League%20%281889%29">Midland League</a> in 1891, and were <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">elected</a> to <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a> of the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1894 after finishing second. Leicester's first-ever Football League game was a 4–3 defeat at <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a>, with a first League win the following week, against <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a> at Filbert Street. The same season also saw the team's largest win to date, a 13–0 victory over Notts Olympic in an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> qualifying game. In <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">1907–08</a> the club finished as Second Division runners-up, gaining <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, the highest level of English football. However, the club was relegated after a <a href="1908%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">single season</a> which included the team's record defeat, a 12–0 loss against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>.
In 1919, when league football resumed after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Leicester Fosse ceased trading due to financial difficulties. The club was reformed as "Leicester City Football Club", particularly appropriate as the borough of Leicester had recently been given <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city status</a>. Following the name change, the club enjoyed moderate success in the 1920s; under the <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">management</a> of <a href="Peter%20Hodge">Peter Hodge</a>, who left in May 1926 to be replaced two months later by <a href="Willie%20Orr">Willie Orr</a>, and with record goalscorer <a href="Arthur%20Chandler%20%28footballer%29">Arthur Chandler</a> in the side, they won the Division Two title in <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20in%20English%20football">1924–25</a> and recorded their second-highest league finish in <a href="1928%E2%80%9329%20in%20English%20football">1928–29</a> as runners-up by a single point to <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">The Wednesday</a>. However, the 1930s saw a downturn in fortunes, with the club relegated in <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20in%20English%20football">1934–35</a> and, after promotion in <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20in%20English%20football">1936–37</a>, another relegation in <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20in%20English%20football">1938–39</a> would see them finish the decade in Division Two.
Post-World War II (1949–2000).
Leicester reached the <a href="FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> for the first time in their history in <a href="1949%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1949</a>, losing 3–1 to <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>. The club, however, was celebrating a week later when a draw on the last day of the season ensured survival in Division Two. Leicester won the Division Two championship in 1954, with the help of <a href="Arthur%20Rowley">Arthur Rowley</a>, one of the club's most prolific <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">strikers</a>. Although they were relegated from Division One the next season, under <a href="Dave%20Halliday">Dave Halliday</a> they returned in 1957, with Rowley scoring a club record 44 goals in one season. Leicester remained in Division One until 1969, their longest period ever in the top flight.
Under the management of <a href="Matt%20Gillies">Matt Gillies</a> and his assistant <a href="Bert%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201916%29">Bert Johnson</a>, Leicester reached the FA Cup final on another two occasions, but lost in both <a href="1961%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1961</a> and <a href="1963%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1963</a>. As they lost to double winners <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> in 1961, they were England's representatives in the <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%201961%E2%80%9362">1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup</a>. In the <a href="1963%20in%20association%20football">1962–63 season</a>, the club led the First Division during the winter. Thanks to a sensational run of form on icy and frozen pitches, the team became nicknamed the "<a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">"Ice Kings"</a>" and eventually finished fourth, the club's best post-war finish. Gillies guided Leicester to their first piece of silverware in 1964, when Leicester beat <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> 4–3 on aggregate to win the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> for the first time. Leicester also reached the League Cup final the following year but lost 3–2 on aggregate to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. Gillies and Johnson received praise for their version of the "whirl" and the "switch" system, a system that had previously been used by the <a href="Austria%20national%20football%20team">Austrian</a> and <a href="Hungary%20national%20football%20team">Hungarian</a> national teams. After a bad start to the season, Matt Gillies resigned in November 1968. His successor <a href="Frank%20O%27Farrell">Frank O'Farrell</a> was unable to prevent relegation, but the club reached the FA Cup final in <a href="1969%20FA%20Cup%20final">1969</a>, losing to Manchester City 1–0.
In 1971, Leicester were promoted back to the First Division, and won the <a href="1971%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">Charity Shield</a> for the first time. Due to <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> winners <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>'s commitments in European competition, Second Division winners Leicester were invited to play FA Cup runners-up <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, beating them 1–0 thanks to a goal by <a href="Steve%20Whitworth">Steve Whitworth</a>. <a href="Jimmy%20Bloomfield">Jimmy Bloomfield</a> was appointed for the new season, and his team remained in the First Division for his tenure. Leicester reached the <a href="FA%20Cup%20semi-finals">FA Cup semi-final</a> in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20FA%20Cup">1973–74</a>.
<a href="Frank%20McLintock">Frank McLintock</a>, a noted player for seven years for Leicester in a successful period from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, succeeded Bloomfield in 1977. The club was relegated at the end of the 1977–78 season and McLintock resigned. <a href="Jock%20Wallace">Jock Wallace</a> resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Second Division championship in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20in%20English%20football%23Second%20Division">1980</a>. Wallace was unable to keep Leicester in the First Division, but they reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous home-grown players, <a href="Gary%20Lineker">Gary Lineker</a>, emerged into the first-team squad. Leicester's next manager was <a href="Gordon%20Milne">Gordon Milne</a>, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division, but was sold to Everton in 1985; two years later Leicester were relegated, having failed to find a suitable replacement to partner <a href="Alan%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201962%29">Alan Smith</a>, who was sold to Arsenal after Leicester went down.
Milne left in 1986 and was replaced in 1987 by <a href="David%20Pleat">David Pleat</a>, who was sacked in January 1991 with Leicester in danger of relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>. <a href="Gordon%20Lee%20%28footballer%29">Gordon Lee</a> was put in charge of the club until the end of the season. Leicester won their final game of the season, which guided them clear of relegation to the third tier of the Football League.
<a href="Brian%20Little%20%28footballer%29">Brian Little</a> took over in 1991 and by the end of the 1991–92 season Leicester had reached the playoff final for a place in the new <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, but lost to <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> by way of a penalty from former Leicester striker <a href="Mike%20Newell%20%28footballer%29">Mike Newell</a>. The club also reached the playoff final the following year, losing 4–3 to <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a>, having come back from 3–0 down. In 1993–94, Leicester were promoted from the playoffs, beating <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> 2–1 in the final. Little quit as Leicester manager the following November to take charge at <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, and his successor <a href="Mark%20McGhee">Mark McGhee</a> was unable to save Leicester from finishing second-from-bottom in the 1994–95 season.
McGhee left the club unexpectedly in December 1995, while Leicester were top of the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">First Division</a>, to take charge of Wolverhampton Wanderers. McGhee was replaced by <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a>. Under O'Neill, Leicester qualified for the <a href="1996%20Football%20League%20play-offs">1996 Football League play-offs</a> and beat <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> 2–1 in <a href="1996%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20Final">the final</a> through a 120th-minute <a href="Steve%20Claridge">Steve Claridge</a> goal to gain promotion to the Premier League. Following promotion, Leicester established themselves in the Premier League with four successive top ten finishes. O'Neill ended Leicester's 33-year wait for a major trophy, winning the League Cup twice, in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Football%20League%20Cup">1997</a> and <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Football%20League%20Cup">2000</a>, and Leicester were runners-up in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Football%20League%20Cup">1999</a>. Thus, the club qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20UEFA%20Cup">1997–98</a> and <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Cup">2000–01</a>, the club's first European competition since 1961. In June 2000, O'Neill left Leicester City to take over as manager of <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>.
Decline in the early 21st century (2000–2008).
Martin O'Neill was replaced by former <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England under-21</a> coach <a href="Peter%20John%20Taylor">Peter Taylor</a>. During this time, one of Leicester's European appearances ended in a 3–1 defeat to <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> on 28 September 2000 in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. Leicester began well under Taylor's management, topping the Premier League for two weeks in the autumn and remaining in contention for a European place for most of the campaign, before a late-season collapse dragged them down to a 13th-place finish.
Taylor was sacked after a poor start to the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2001–02 season</a>, and his successor <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a> lasted just six months before being succeeded by his assistant <a href="Micky%20Adams">Micky Adams</a>, the change of management being announced just before relegation was confirmed. Leicester won just five league matches all season.
Leicester moved into the new 32,314-seat <a href="King%20Power%20Stadium">Walkers Stadium</a> at the start of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2002–03 season</a>, ending 111 years at Filbert Street. <a href="Walkers%20%28snack%20foods%29">Walkers</a>, the Leicester-based <a href="Potato%20chip">crisp</a> manufacturers, acquired the naming rights for a ten-year period. In October 2002, the club went into administration with debts of £30 million. Some of the reasons were the loss of TV money (<a href="ITV%20Digital">ITV Digital</a>, itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower-than-expected fees for players transferred to other clubs and the £37 million cost of the new stadium. Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, even after the club was rescued with a takeover by a consortium led by Gary Lineker. Adams guided Leicester to the runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premier League with more than 90 points. However, Leicester lasted only one season in the top flight and were relegated to the newly labelled <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>, previously known as Division One.
When Adams resigned as manager in October 2004, <a href="Craig%20Levein">Craig Levein</a> was appointed boss. This would prove to be an unsuccessful period and after 15 months in charge, Levein was sacked, having failed to get The Foxes anywhere near the promotion places. Assistant manager <a href="Rob%20Kelly">Rob Kelly</a> took over as <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker manager</a>, and after winning three out of four matches, was appointed to see out the rest of the season. Kelly steered Leicester to safety and in April 2006 was given the manager's job on a permanent basis.
In October 2006, ex-<a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> chairman <a href="Milan%20Mandari%C4%87">Milan Mandarić</a> was quoted as saying he was interested in buying the club, reportedly at a price of around £6 million, with the current playing squad valued at roughly £4.2 million. The takeover was formally announced on 13 February 2007. On 11 April 2007, Rob Kelly was sacked as manager and <a href="Nigel%20Worthington">Nigel Worthington</a> appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. Worthington saved the club from relegation, but was not offered the job on a permanent basis. On 25 May 2007, the club announced former <a href="Milton%20Keynes%20Dons%20F.C.">Milton Keynes Dons</a> manager <a href="Martin%20Allen">Martin Allen</a> as their new manager with a three-year contract. Allen's relationship with Mandarić became tense and after only four matches, Allen left by mutual consent on 29 August 2007. On 13 September 2007, Mandarić announced <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a> as the new manager of the club, citing Megson's "wealth of experience" as a deciding factor in the appointment. However, Megson left on 24 October 2007 after only six weeks in charge, following an approach made for his services by <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. Mandarić placed <a href="Frank%20Burrows">Frank Burrows</a> and <a href="Gerry%20Taggart">Gerry Taggart</a> in the shared position as caretaker managers until a professional manager was appointed.
On 22 November, <a href="Ian%20Holloway">Ian Holloway</a> was appointed manager, and he became the first Leicester manager in over 50 years to win his first league match in charge, beating <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> 2–0. However, this success did not last, and Leicester were relegated from the Championship at the end of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>. Holloway left by mutual consent after less than a season at the club, being replaced by <a href="Nigel%20Pearson">Nigel Pearson</a>.
Rise back to Premier League and new ownership (2008–2015).
The <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 campaign</a> was Leicester's first season outside the top two <a href="English%20football%20league%20system%23Promotion%20and%20relegation%20rules%20for%20the%20top%20eight%20levels">levels of English football</a>, but they hit this nadir only seven years before becoming the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Premier%20League">2015–16 Premier League</a> champions – one of the fastest ever rises to the top of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. Following relegation to the third tier the previous season, Leicester returned to the Championship at the first attempt in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20One">2008–09</a>, finishing as champions of <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> after a 2–0 win at <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a>, with two matches in hand. The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 season</a> saw Leicester's revival under manager Nigel Pearson continue, as the club finished fifth and reached the <a href="EFL%20Championship%20play-offs">Championship play-offs</a> in their first season back in the second tier. Though coming from 2–0 down on aggregate, away to <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a>, to briefly lead 3–2, they eventually lost to a <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a> in the play-off semi-final. At the end of the season, Pearson left Leicester to become the manager of <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a>, claiming he felt the club seemed reluctant to keep him, and that <a href="Paulo%20Sousa">Paulo Sousa</a> had been the club's guest at both play-off games, hinting at a possible replacement. On 7 July 2010, Sousa was confirmed as Pearson's replacement.
In August 2010, following agreement on a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with <a href="duty-free">duty-free</a> retailers the <a href="King%20Power">King Power Group</a>, Mandarić sold the club to Thai-led consortium Asian Football Investments (AFI), fronted by King Power Group's <a href="Vichai%20Srivaddhanaprabha">Vichai</a> and his son <a href="Aiyawatt%20Srivaddhanaprabha">Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha</a>. Mandarić, an investor in AFI, was retained as club chairman. On 1 October 2010, after a poor start that saw Leicester bottom of the Championship with only one win out of the first nine league matches, Paulo Sousa was sacked by the club with immediate effect. Two days later, <a href="Sven-G%C3%B6ran%20Eriksson">Sven-Göran Eriksson</a>, who had been approached by the club after the 6–1 loss to then bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth two weeks earlier, was appointed as his replacement, signing a two-year contract with the club. On 10 February 2011, Vichai, part of the Thai-based Asia Football Investments consortium, was appointed new chairman of the club after Mandarić left in November to take over <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>.
Leicester were viewed as one of the favourites for promotion in the 2011–12 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 matches, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent. Three weeks later, Nigel Pearson returned to the club as Eriksson's successor. Pearson would go on to lead The Foxes to a sixth-place finish in the 2012–13 season, ensuring Leicester were in the Championship play-offs. However, Leicester lost the playoff semi-final 3–2 on aggregate to <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a> after <a href="Manuel%20Almunia">Manuel Almunia</a> made a double save from an <a href="Anthony%20Knockaert">Anthony Knockaert</a> late penalty and <a href="Troy%20Deeney">Troy Deeney</a> scored at the other end following a swift counterattack.
In 2014, Leicester's march up the league system hit a breakthrough. Their 2–1 home win over <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, combined with losses by <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> and <a href="Derby%20County">Derby County</a>, allowed Leicester City to clinch promotion to the Premier League after a ten-year absence. Later that month, a win at <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers">Bolton Wanderers</a> saw Leicester become champions of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Football%20League%20Championship">2013–14 Championship</a> for a joint record 7th time.
Leicester started their first season in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> since 2004 with a good run of results in their first five league matches, starting with a 2–2 draw on the opening day against <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. The Foxes then claimed their first <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> win since May 2004, with a 1–0 win at Stoke City. On 21 September 2014, Leicester went on to produce one of the greatest comebacks in Premier League history, beating <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> 5–3 at <a href="King%20Power%20Stadium">King Power Stadium</a>. They made <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> history by becoming the first team to beat Manchester United from a two-goal deficit since the league's launch in 1992.
During the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a>, a dismal run of form saw the team slip to the bottom of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. This could have brought a sudden end to Leicester's seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant The Foxes finished the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers, and Leicester's upturn in results was described as one of the Premier League's greatest-ever escapes from relegation. They also became only the third team in <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> history to survive after being bottom at <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> (the other two being <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Premier%20League">2005</a> and <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">2014</a>), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously stayed up.
Premier League champions and following years (2015–2020).
On 30 June 2015, <a href="Nigel%20Pearson">Nigel Pearson</a> was sacked, with the club stating "the working relationship is no longer viable." The sacking was linked to a number of <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> issues involving Pearson throughout the season, with the final straw involving his son <a href="James%20Pearson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201993%29">James</a>' role in a "racist sex tape" made by three Leicester reserve players in Thailand during a post-season goodwill tour. Leicester reacted by appointing former Chelsea manager <a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a> as their new manager for the new <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Premier%20League">2015–16 Premier League season</a>. Despite an initially sceptical reaction to Ranieri's appointment, the club made an exceptional start to the season. Striker <a href="Jamie%20Vardy">Jamie Vardy</a> scored 13 goals over 11 consecutive matches from August to November, breaking <a href="Ruud%20van%20Nistelrooy">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a>'s Premier League record of scoring in 10 consecutive matches. On 19 December, Leicester defeated Everton 3–2 at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a> to top the Premier League on Christmas Day, having been bottom exactly 12 months earlier. A 2–0 victory at Sunderland on 10 April, coupled with Tottenham Hotspur's 3–0 win over Manchester United, ensured Leicester's qualification for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the first time in their history.
Leicester won the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> on 2 May 2016 after Tottenham lost a 2–0 lead against Chelsea, drawing 2–2 at the "Battle of <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>". <a href="Bookmaker">Bookmaker</a>s thought Leicester's victory was so unlikely that <a href="Ladbrokes">Ladbrokes</a> and <a href="William%20Hill%20%28bookmaker%29">William Hill</a> offered odds of 5,000–1 for it at the start of the season, which subsequently resulted in the largest payout in British sporting history with total winnings of £25 million. A number of newspapers described Leicester's title win as the greatest sporting shock ever; multiple <a href="bookmaker">bookmaker</a>s including <a href="Ladbrokes">Ladbrokes</a> and William Hill had never paid out at such long odds for any sport. One book was titled "The Unbelievables", a spin-off harking back to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>'s undefeated team "<a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28football%29%23Arsenal">The Invincibles</a>". The scale of the surprise title victory attracted global attention for the club and the city of Leicester. "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" declared it would be "pored over for management lessons." Several commentators viewed it as an inspiration to other clubs and fundamentally transforming expectations.
Leicester became known for their counterattacking style of play, "incredible pace in the areas it is most essential" and defensive solidarity. Former boss <a href="Nigel%20Pearson">Nigel Pearson</a> was credited by pundits and fans as having laid the foundations for Leicester's title winning season. Reacting to the title win, then executive chairman of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> <a href="Richard%20Scudamore">Richard Scudamore</a> said:
Leicester, while performing well in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, struggled domestically during 2016–17, spending much of the first few months in the bottom half of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> table. In December 2016, Ranieri was awarded <a href="BBC%20Sports%20Personality%20of%20the%20Year%20Coach%20Award">coach of the year</a> and Leicester <a href="BBC%20Sports%20Personality%20Team%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">team of the year</a> at the <a href="BBC%20Sports%20Personality%20of%20the%20Year">BBC Sports Personality of the Year</a>. However, on 23 February 2017, Ranieri was dismissed due to the club's continuing poor form, resulting in them being only one point above the relegation zone. The sacking was met with significant upset and anger from sections of the media, with Gary Lineker calling the sacking "very sad" and "inexplicable", while Manchester United manager <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a> blamed it on "selfish players". Rumours began emerging some days later that players had been meeting with the owners to discuss Ranieri's sacking without Ranieri knowing, which sparked widespread outrage over social media, but these were never proven. <a href="Craig%20Shakespeare">Craig Shakespeare</a> took over as caretaker manager, and in his first match in charge, Leicester won 3–1 against 5th placed Liverpool. In his second match as caretaker, Shakespeare led Leicester to another 3–1 victory over Hull City. Following those two results, it was decided on 12 March 2017 that Shakespeare would become manager until the end of the season.
The <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a> campaign was also the first season in 15 years that Leicester qualified for European football. Leicester were placed in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage%23Group%20G">Group G</a> of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2016–17 UEFA Champions League</a>, alongside <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a>, <a href="F.C.%20Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="Club%20Brugge%20KV">Club Brugge</a>. In their inaugural Champions League campaign, they went undefeated in their first five matches to progress to the knockout stages as group winners. "The Foxes" then faced <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> club <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Round%20of%2016">round of 16</a> and defeated the Spanish side 2–0 on the night, and 3–2 on aggregate to advance to the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Quarter-finals">quarter-finals</a>. There they faced <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, and drew 1–1 in the second leg, but lost 2–1 on aggregate after losing 1–0 in the first leg. This put an end to Leicester's 2016–17 European campaign, and they finished as Champions League quarter-finalists. Despite the loss, Leicester remained unbeaten at home in the 2016–17 Champions League.
Craig Shakespeare, having impressed during his caretaker spell, was appointed full-time on a three-year contract. However, following a poor start to the season he was sacked in October 2017 after four months officially in charge, with Leicester in 18th place in the table. He was replaced by former Southampton boss <a href="Claude%20Puel">Claude Puel</a> on 25 October 2017. By Christmas, Leicester were in 8th place in the Premier League and finished 9th at the end of the season.
On 27 October 2018, the helicopter carrying chairman <a href="Vichai%20Srivaddhanaprabha">Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha</a> and four others <a href="2018%20Leicester%20helicopter%20crash">malfunctioned and crashed</a> outside King Power Stadium, shortly after taking off from the pitch. This followed a home match against <a href="West%20Ham%20United">West Ham United</a>, and all five people on board the helicopter died. Following the crash, the club announced plans for a permanent memorial in the form of a statue. One year later, The Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Memorial Garden officially opened on 27 October 2019, before The Khun Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Statue was unveiled on 4 April 2022, which would have been Srivaddhanaprabha's 64th birthday.
Leicester suffered a poor run of results in 2019 which included four successive home defeats, and following a 4–1 home defeat to Crystal Palace, manager Claude Puel was sacked on 24 February 2019 with the club in 12th place. Former Liverpool manager <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> was appointed as his replacement, and the club finished the season again in 9th place.
The <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">2019–20</a> season started with the team picking up 38 points from their first 16 matches, which included a record eight-game winning streak from 19 October to 8 December. On 25 October 2019, Leicester recorded a <a href="Southampton%20F.C.%200%E2%80%939%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.">0–9 away win</a> at <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20highest-scoring%20Premier%20League%20games">joint-largest win in Premier League history</a> and the <a href="Football%20records%20and%20statistics%20in%20England">largest away win in English top-flight history</a>. In the same season, the club reached the semi-final stage of the <a href="League%20Cup">League Cup</a> but lost out to <a href="Aston%20Villa">Aston Villa</a> over two legs. Despite being in the top four for most of the season, Leicester suffered a drop-off in form at the end of the season, winning only two of their nine games following the resumption of league play due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20England">coronavirus pandemic</a>. Three defeats in their last four matches saw them slide into fifth, the second-highest Premier League finish in their history, securing a place in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> for the following season.
FA Cup winners and following years (2021–present).
On 15 May 2021, Leicester won their first ever <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, having lost all of their previous four finals, in the process securing a second major trophy in the space of five years; <a href="Youri%20Tielemans">Youri Tielemans</a> scored the only goal against <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>. They also won the <a href="2021%20FA%20Community%20Shield">2021 FA Community Shield</a>, the second in their history. After finishing 5th again in the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Premier%20League">2020–21 Premier League</a>, Leicester qualified for the Europa League for the second consecutive year.
In their <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2021–22 UEFA Europa League</a> campaign, Leicester came third in their group and were transferred to the newly established <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League">UEFA Europa Conference League</a>. They went on to reach their first ever European semi-final, losing out to eventual winners <a href="A.S.%20Roma">A.S. Roma</a> over two legs. In the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the club finished in 8th place.
The club's finances were heavily affected by the COVID pandemic, with the parent company <a href="King%20Power">King Power International Group</a> being in the travel retail (DF&TR) sector. As a consequence, the club were restricted in their spending in the 2022 summer transfer market, amid additional concerns over breaching <a href="Financial%20Fair%20Play">Financial Fair Play</a> regulations. At the same time, the club were also continuing to invest in the infrastructure to better compete with the 'big six' in the longer term. 
Rodgers left the club on 2 April 2023 via mutual consent, with ten games remaining and the team in the relegation zone. <a href="Dean%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201971%29">Dean Smith</a> was appointed as his replacement until the end of the season. On 28 May, despite a 2–1 home win over <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>, Leicester City were relegated as a consequence of <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>'s 1–0 home victory over <a href="AFC%20Bournemouth">AFC Bournemouth</a>. This ended the club's nine-year stint in the Premier League, making them only the second former Premier League champions to be relegated from the league since it began in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">1992–93</a>, following <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20FA%20Premier%20League">1998–99</a>.
On 16 June 2023, <a href="Enzo%20Maresca">Enzo Maresca</a> was appointed as the club's new manager ahead of the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20EFL%20Championship">2023–24 EFL Championship</a> season. Leicester went on to make their best ever start to a league season, and the best since the league became known as the Championship in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Football%20League%20Championship">2004–05</a>.
Club identity.
The club's traditional home colours of royal blue shirts, white shorts and either white or blue socks have been used for the team's kits throughout most of its history. In more recent times, the club have alternated between either white or blue shorts. 
An image of a <a href="fox">fox</a> was first incorporated into the club crest in 1948. Since 1992, the club's badge has featured a fox's head overlaid onto a Cinquefoil; the Cinquefoil is similar to the one used on the <a href="Leicester%23Coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms of Leicester</a>.
The club's stadium move in 2002 prompted some changes to the crest, and the design has since evolved further. For the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 season</a>, the club's 125th anniversary year, a special edition crest was worn on the home and away kits. For this season's away kit, there was also a return to the first ever colours worn by the club (originally Leicester Fosse), albeit with black shorts as opposed to the original white. This kit returned once again for the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2023–24 season</a>, having also featured during the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.%20season">2004–05 season</a>.
In 1941, the club adopted the playing of the <a href="Post%20horn%23Post%20Horn%20Galop">Post Horn Galop</a> at home matches, to signal both teams entering the pitch. To the present day, the tune is usually played live on the pitch for the first half, while a modern version of the tune is played over the <a href="PA%20system">PA system</a> for the second half. The club's anthem is <a href="When%20You%27re%20Smiling">When You're Smiling</a>, with its origin believed to date back to the late 1970's. Despite being sung by fans at home and away matches since then, it wasn't until 2022 when the club formally began playing a version of the tune before kick-off on home matchdays. "Foxes Never Quit" is the club's <a href="motto">motto</a>, with these words placed above the tunnel inside the stadium.

The first sponsorship logo to appear on a Leicester shirt was that of <a href="Ind%20Coope">Ind Coope</a> in 1983. British snack food manufacturer <a href="Walkers%20Crisps">Walkers Crisps</a> are the club's official snack partner. <a href="Walkers%20Crisps">Walkers Crisps</a> have held a long association with the club, sponsoring their shirts from 1987 to 2001 and the stadium from 2002 to 2011.

Stadium and training ground.
In their early years, Leicester played at numerous grounds, but have only played at two since they joined the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a>. When first starting out, they played on a field by Fosse Road, hence the original club name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to <a href="Victoria%20Park%2C%20Leicester">Victoria Park</a>, and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane. After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the <a href="Grace%20Road">County Cricket ground</a> while seeking a new ground. The club secured the use of an area of land by <a href="Filbert%20Street">Filbert Street</a> and moved there in 1891.
Some improvements by noted football architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> occurred in the Edwardian era, and in 1927 a new two-tier stand was built, nicknamed "the Double Decker", which would persist until the ground's closure in 2002. With the exception of the addition of compulsory seating, the ground saw no further development until 1993, when the Main Stand was demolished and replaced by the new Carling Stand. The addition of the new stand, while the rest of the ground had been untouched since the 1920s, led manager <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a> to joke that he used to "lead new signings out backwards" so they only saw the Carling Stand.
The club moved away from Filbert Street in 2002, to a new 32,500-capacity all-seater stadium located less than a mile away. The current site was known as the <a href="Walkers%20Stadium">Walkers Stadium</a> until 2011 in a deal with Leicester-based food manufacturers <a href="Walkers%20%28snack%20foods%29">Walkers</a>. The first match hosted at the stadium was a 1–1 friendly draw against <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>, with Bilbao's <a href="Tiko%20%28footballer%29">Tiko</a> being the first scorer at the stadium and <a href="Jordan%20Stewart%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201982%29">Jordan Stewart</a> being the first Leicester player to score. The first competitive match was a 2–0 victory against Watford.
On 19 August 2010, it emerged that the new owners <a href="King%20Power">King Power</a> wanted to rename the stadium King Power Stadium, and had plans to increase the capacity to 42,000 should Leicester secure promotion. On 5 July 2011, Leicester City confirmed the Walkers Stadium would now be known as King Power Stadium. The stadium's capacity is currently 32,262. In 2020, the club moved into a new state-of-the-art training complex in the Leicestershire village of <a href="Seagrave">Seagrave</a>, described as being "one of the world's most advanced training facilities." The club's former training ground Belvoir Drive now serves as the training ground for <a href="Leicester%20City%20W.F.C.">Leicester City Women</a>.
Rivalries.
<a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> and <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> are the club's <a href="East%20Midlands">East Midlands</a> rivals, while they also share a rivalry with <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a> of the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28region%29">West Midlands</a>. Leicester were widely considered to be Nottingham Forest's main rivals prior to the mid-1970s. However, when <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a> was appointed as Forest manager in 1975, much to the dismay of Derby fans, the rivalry between Forest and Derby quickly intensified.
Managerial history.
Leicester City's current manager is <a href="Enzo%20Maresca">Enzo Maresca</a>, the club's 50th permanent manager. <a href="Nigel%20Pearson">Nigel Pearson</a> and Peter Hodge have both had two separate spells in charge of the club. <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a> also had a second spell as caretaker manager after his spell as permanent manager. Up until <a href="Peter%20Hodge">Peter Hodge</a> was hired after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the club had no official manager. A nominal role of secretary/manager was employed, though the board and the selection committee took control of most team affairs. It was Hodge who instated a system at the club for the manager having complete control over player and staff recruitment, team selection, and <a href="Tactic%20%28method%29">tactic</a>s. Though Hodge was originally also titled "secretary/manager" he has retrospectively been named as the club's first official "manager."
Records and statistics.
<a href="Graham%20Cross">Graham Cross</a> holds the record for the most Leicester appearances, with the defender playing 600 games between 1960 and 1976, increased from 599 following the club's decision to incorporate the 1971 Charity Shield into official records. However, <a href="Adam%20Black%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201898%29">Adam Black</a> holds the record for the most appearances in the league with 528 between 1920 and 1935.
Striker <a href="Arthur%20Chandler%20%28footballer%29">Arthur Chandler</a> is currently the club's all-time record goal scorer, netting 273 in his 12 years at the club; he also found the net in 8 consecutive matches in the 1924–25 season. The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 44 by <a href="Arthur%20Rowley">Arthur Rowley</a>, in the 1956–57 season. The fastest goal in the club's history was scored by <a href="Matty%20Fryatt">Matty Fryatt</a>, when he netted after just nine seconds against <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> in April 2006.
<a href="Jamie%20Vardy">Jamie Vardy</a> broke the Premier League record by scoring in 11 consecutive Premier League games, scoring 13 in the process during the 2015–16 Premier League season. Vardy is also the ninth player to score 20 top-flight goals in a season, following Arthur Chandler, Ernie Hine, Arthur Rowley, Jimmy Walsh, Ken Keyworth, Jackie Sinclair, Frank Worthington and Gary Lineker. Vardy's goal at Sunderland on 10 April 2016 saw him become the first player since Gary Lineker in 1984–85 to score 20 top flight goals for the club, having already become Leicester's highest Premier League scorer in a single season.
The record transfer fee paid by Leicester for a player was in the region of £32-to-40 million for midfielder <a href="Youri%20Tielemans">Youri Tielemans</a> from <a href="AS%20Monaco">AS Monaco</a>. The highest transfer fee received for a Leicester player was approximately £80 million from <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> for <a href="Harry%20Maguire">Harry Maguire</a>; at the time of the transfer this was the eleventh-highest-ever fee, the highest-ever move between two English teams, and the highest-ever for a defender.
The club's record home attendance is 47,298, for a fifth-round <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> match against <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> at <a href="Filbert%20Street">Filbert Street</a> in 1928. The current record home attendance at the current stadium is 32,242, for a <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> match against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> on 8 August 2015. The highest-ever attendance for a non-competitive football match at King Power Stadium stands at 32,188, for a pre-season friendly against <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> on 30 July 2011.
Leicester's highest-ever league finish is first in the Premier League in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Premier%20League">2015–16</a>. Their lowest-ever league finish was first in League One in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20One">2008–09</a>. The club currently hold the joint all-time record for second tier titles, sharing a total of seven with <a href="Manchester%20City">Manchester City</a>.
Leicester's longest-ever unbeaten run in the league was between 1 November 2008 and 7 March 2009, in which the team remained unbeaten for 23 games on their way to the <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a> title. The club's longest run of consecutive victories in league football is currently nine, which the team achieved between 21 December 2013 and 1 February 2014 in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>.
In the 2015–16 season, Leicester achieved many new club records in what "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" described as "one of the most astonishing league titles of all-time". They recorded the fewest losses in any of the club's previous <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> seasons, the fewest away defeats in any top-flight season, and the most consecutive wins in the top flight. Those consecutive victories came against <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>, <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>, <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> and <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>. Coincidentally, Leicester kept a record of five straight clean sheets against each of the same five opponents. The King Power Stadium's home crowds in 2015–16 saw their team beaten just once in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> all season.
Leicester made their <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> debut in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2016–17 season</a>, their fourth appearance in European football. The club became the third English team to win on their Champions League debut, after Manchester United in 1994 and Newcastle United in 1997. They also became the first English team to win away on their Champions League debut, and win all three of their opening games in the competition. Leicester are currently the first and only team in Champions League history to keep clean sheets in each of their opening four games in the competition. In March 2017, the club became the 50th to reach the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> quarter-finals.
On 25 October 2019, the Leicester team set the record for the highest margin of away victory in English top-flight history, defeating Southampton <a href="Southampton%20F.C.%200%E2%80%939%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.">9–0</a> at <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Stadium">St Mary's Stadium</a>. In doing so they also tied the record for the highest margin of victory in Premier League history, equalling Manchester United's <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.%209%E2%80%930%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">9–0 home victory</a> over <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> in 1995. As a result, Leicester City hold the all-time top tier records for the biggest defeat, biggest away win, and highest-scoring draw.
In the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20EFL%20Championship">2023–24 EFL Championship</a> season, the club made its best ever start to a league season, and the best in the competition's history (since being known as the Championship). During this period, the club also set a new record of six straight away wins, matched the all-time record of nine consecutive league wins home and away, and went four home matches without conceding for the first time since 1973.
League history.
Since their election to the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1894, Leicester City have spent all but one season within the top two tiers of English football. During the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09</a> season, they played in <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a>, the third tier of English football, after the club's relegation from <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">the Championship</a> in the previous season. However, the club made an instant return to the second tier and were promoted as <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20One">2008–09 League One</a> champions.

The team compete in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>, the second level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. 
Formed in 1876, they have played at the <a href="Riverside%20Stadium">Riverside Stadium</a> since 1995. The club played at <a href="Ayresome%20Park">Ayresome Park</a> for 92 years, from 1903 to 1995. Middlesbrough were one of the founding members of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992 and, with <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> and <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, were the first clubs to be relegated from it following the 1992–93 season. The club came close to folding in 1986 after experiencing severe financial difficulties before they were saved by a <a href="consortium">consortium</a> led by then board member and later chairman <a href="Steve%20Gibson%20%28businessman%29">Steve Gibson</a>. During the early Gibson years in the Premier League the club signed several high-profile players, although this did not translate into success and in 1997 the club suffered two lost cup finals and a relegation in the same year. The club's main rivals are <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>.
The club's achievements include winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> in <a href="2004%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2004</a>, their first and to date only major trophy, and reaching the <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Cup%20final">2006 UEFA Cup final</a>, losing to Spanish club <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>. Their highest league finish to date was third place in the top flight in the <a href="1913%E2%80%9314%20in%20English%20football">1913–14 season</a>, whilst the club have only spent two seasons outside the top two divisions of English football. The League Cup win and the UEFA Cup run was part of an 11-year consecutive stay in the Premier League, before a relegation in 2009. Although the club returned in 2016, instant relegation followed, and the club has not returned to the Premier League since.
The club's traditional kit is red with white detailing. The home shorts and sock colours have interchangeably been shifted between red and white, complementing the red shirt that was adopted in 1899. The various crests throughout the club's history, the most recent of which was adopted in 2007, incorporate a lion rampant.
History.
Formation and early years (1876–1914).
Middlesbrough were formed in 1876, and won the <a href="FA%20Amateur%20Cup">FA Amateur Cup</a> in 1895 and again in 1898. The club turned professional in 1889, but reverted to amateur status in 1892. They turned professional permanently in 1899. After three seasons, they won promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, where they would remain for the next .
In 1903, the club moved to <a href="Ayresome%20Park">Ayresome Park</a>, their home for the next . In 1905, the club sanctioned the transfer of <a href="Alf%20Common">Alf Common</a> for <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>1,000, a record fee. In the same year, <a href="Tim%20Williamson">Tim Williamson</a> became the first Middlesbrough player to play international football.
Over the next few years, their form fluctuated greatly, rising to sixth in <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">1907–08</a> before dropping to 17th two seasons later. The club rose to their highest league finish to date, third, in <a href="1913%E2%80%9314%20in%20English%20football">1913–14</a>. The <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> soon intervened, and football was suspended.
Ups and downs (1914–1966).
Before league football resumed, Middlesbrough won the Northern Victory League, but the team were unable to maintain their previous form and finished the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20</a> season in mid-table. They remained in the First Division for the next few seasons, but were relegated in <a href="1923%E2%80%9324%20in%20English%20football">1923–24</a> after finishing bottom, 10 points adrift of their nearest rivals. Three seasons later, they won the <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Two">Division Two</a> title. During that season, debutant <a href="George%20Camsell">George Camsell</a>, who had signed from <a href="Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a> side Durham City the previous season, finished with a record 59 league goals, which included nine hat-tricks. He would continue as top scorer for each of the next 10 seasons. Middlesbrough's tenure back in the top flight lasted only one season, and the club were relegated. They were promoted at the first attempt in <a href="1928%E2%80%9329%20in%20English%20football">1928–29</a>, winning another Second Division title. The club remained in the First Division until 1954.
The decade before the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> saw the emergence of <a href="Wilf%20Mannion">Wilf Mannion</a> and <a href="George%20Hardwick">George Hardwick</a>, both of whom would go on to become <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> internationals in the years ahead. Middlesbrough climbed to fourth in the last full season before the war, and were expected to challenge for the title the following season, but the war intervened. After the war, the club was unable to recover the form of the previous seasons before the war, hovering around mid-table and exiting in the early rounds of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. Soon after the war, the team began to falter, and were relegated in <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20in%20English%20football">1953–54</a>. This was the start of a 20-year spell outside the top division, but this was the spell too that saw the emergence of one of the club's top goalscorers, <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a>, who scored 204 goals in 222 games, before he left for <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>. Over that period, Middlesbrough maintained reasonable progress in the Second Division, but were never serious contenders for promotion. After a fourth-place finish in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1962–63</a>, the club endured a steady decline and were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for the first time in their history in 1966.
Resurgence and financial crisis (1966–1994).
New manager <a href="Stan%20Anderson">Stan Anderson</a> returned the club to the second flight at the first attempt. Middlesbrough would not finish below ninth during the next eight seasons. By 1974, <a href="Jack%20Charlton">Jack Charlton</a> had taken over as manager and guided the team back to the top flight. They ensured promotion as early as 23 March, and with eight games of the season left, they became runaway champions, finishing with a record 65 points. Middlesbrough won their first silverware as a professional side in <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football">the 1975–76 season</a>, lifting the <a href="Anglo-Scottish%20Cup">Anglo-Scottish Cup</a> in its inaugural season after a two-legged final win over <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>.
In 1979, <a href="John%20Neal%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201932%29">John Neal</a> made the clubs first international signing, with <a href="Bo%C5%BEo%20Jankovi%C4%87">Boško Janković</a> arriving from <a href="FK%20%C5%BDeljezni%C4%8Dar%20Sarajevo">Željezničar Sarajevo</a>.
The club experienced severe financial difficulties during the mid-1980s. Middlesbrough were dropping down the table, and finished 19th in the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85 season</a>. In April 1986, the club had to borrow £30,000 from the <a href="Professional%20Footballers%27%20Association">Professional Footballers' Association</a> (PFA) to pay wages. The final game of the season saw Middlesbrough relegated to the Third Division again. That summer, the club called in the <a href="Official%20Receiver">Provisional Liquidator</a>, and, shortly afterwards, the club was wound up and the gates to Ayresome Park were padlocked. Without the £350,000 capital required for <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> registration, a new rule, it seemed inevitable that the club would fold permanently. <a href="Steve%20Gibson%20%28businessman%29">Steve Gibson</a>, however, a member of the board at the time, brought together a consortium, and with 10 minutes to spare before the deadline they completed their registration with the Football League for the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87 season</a>. Following the registration came both a change of club crest and a change of the official company name to Middlesbrough Football and Athletic Club (1986) Ltd.
Over the next two seasons, Middlesbrough gained successive promotions into Division Two and then into Division One. The next season, however, they came straight back down to Division Two, and with it came the then British transfer record move of <a href="Gary%20Pallister">Gary Pallister</a> to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> for £2.3 million. Despite constant promotion and relegation, Middlesbrough were founding members of the <a href="Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a> for the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">1992–93 season</a>.
Bryan Robson years (1994–2001).
Player-manager <a href="Bryan%20Robson">Bryan Robson</a>, from Manchester United, took charge in 1994 and Middlesbrough were brought back into national attention. Following promotion to the Premier League and high-profile purchases like Brazilian international <a href="Juninho%20Paulista">Juninho</a>, many considered Middlesbrough to be on the rise. A difficult <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20FA%20Premier%20League">1996–97 season</a>, however, was compounded by a deduction of three points imposed just after Christmas as punishment for the club's failure to fulfil a fixture against <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, which ultimately resulted in relegation.<ref name="PremierLeague96/97"></ref> Without the points deduction imposed by the FA Premier League despite the club having taken advice from the Premier League themselves prior to calling off the match, the club would have had enough points to avoid the drop. At the same time, the club reached both the <a href="1997%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">League</a> and <a href="1997%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup</a> finals for the first time, but lost both games. Despite being in the second tier, they were again runners-up in the <a href="1998%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">League Cup final the next year</a>.
Despite losing high-profile players <a href="Fabrizio%20Ravanelli">Fabrizio Ravanelli</a> and Juninho due to relegation, Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premier League at the first attempt, in 1998. The following season saw them settle well and they had a 12-game unbeaten run midway through <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20FA%20Premier%20League">1998–99</a>, including a 3–2 win at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> in January during which they took a 3–0 lead; it was Manchester United's only home defeat during their <a href="treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a>-winning <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">season</a>. Middlesbrough continued to stay secure in mid-table the following season, thanks mainly to the goals of <a href="Hamilton%20Ricard">Hamilton Ricard</a> and the signings of big name players such as <a href="Paul%20Ince">Paul Ince</a> and <a href="Christian%20Ziege">Christian Ziege</a>. In <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Premier%20League">2000–01</a>, they had a brief relegation scare that was solved with the arrival of <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a> as co-manager, and a 3–0 win away at <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in April was the team's best result. The trend of buying European-based players continued with the acquisitions of <a href="Christian%20Karembeu">Christian Karembeu</a> and <a href="Alen%20Bok%C5%A1i%C4%87">Alen Bokšić</a>. Bryan Robson left the club before the start of <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20FA%20Premier%20League">2001–02 season</a>, having served as manager for seven years.
Return to top flight and venture into Europe (2001–2009).
Manchester United assistant coach <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a> replaced Robson. The following seasons saw Premier League security maintained, as Middlesbrough slowly improved and were seen as a tough side to beat when playing at the Riverside Stadium. During McClaren's time as manager, Middlesbrough achieved their highest Premier League placing, finishing seventh in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Premier%20League">2004–05</a>.
Under mcClaren, the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Middlesbrough%20F.C.%20season">2003–04 season</a> saw the club win a first major trophy by beating <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> 2–1 in the <a href="2004%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">League Cup final</a> under McClaren. The League cuP win also ensured that Middlesbrough would qualify for Europe – the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> – for the first time, where they reached the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup%20final%20phase%23Round%20of%2016">last 16 of the competition</a>. UEFA Cup qualification was achieved for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">second consecutive year</a> after an eventful 1–1 away draw with <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, a game which concluded with a late penalty save from gaolkeeper <a href="Mark%20Schwarzer">Mark Schwarzer</a>, in the final game of the season.
The final Premier League game in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Middlesbrough%20F.C.%20season">2005–06 season</a>, against <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, included the 15 of the 16 squad members from the local area (the exception was <a href="Malcolm%20Christie">Malcolm Christie</a>). When Josh Walker replaced Christie after 62 minutes, the 11 players on the field were all born within 30 miles of Middlesbrough and all graduates of the club's academy. This was the first all-English starting line-up in the Premier League since <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a> in 1999, the first all-English match squad since Aston Villa in 1998 and the youngest starting line-up in Premier League history.
Middlesbrough reached the <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Cup%20final">2006 UEFA Cup final</a> in <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a>, following two comebacks from 3–0 down in the rounds preceding it, but lost 4–0 to <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>.
Following the cup final loss, McClaren left to manage the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a>, and captain <a href="Gareth%20Southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> took over. Despite not having the coaching qualifications, he was allowed to continue after receiving special dispensation. During the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Middlesbrough%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>, Southgate broke Middlesbrough's record transfer fee, paying £13.6 million for <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazilian international</a> striker <a href="Afonso%20Alves">Afonso Alves</a>. Southgate's first two seasons saw the club finish in 12th and 13th places. He oversaw the club reaching the quarter-finals of the FA Cup for three seasons, but the club was relegated to the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> on the last day of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Middlesbrough%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 season</a>.
Decline, brief revival and relegation (2009–2017).
Middlesbrough sacked Gareth Southgate as manager in October 2009, when Southgate's team were one point from leading the Championship, and replaced him with <a href="Gordon%20Strachan">Gordon Strachan</a>. At the time of Southgate's dismissal, Boro were fourth in the Championship and only one point away from the automatic promotion spot, but their form under Strachan was significantly worse and they finished mid-table.
Despite starting the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Middlesbrough%20F.C.%20season">2010–11 campaign</a> as promotion favourites, the club started the season poorly and Strachan resigned on 18 October, to be replaced by <a href="Tony%20Mowbray">Tony Mowbray</a>. Following a poor run of form in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Middlesbrough%20F.C.%20season">2013–14 campaign</a>, Mowbray left the club with immediate effect on 24 October.
<a href="Aitor%20Karanka">Aitor Karanka</a>, a former <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spain international</a> defender and assistant coach at <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> to <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a>, became the new Middlesbrough manager, signing a two-year contract. He became the first non-British manager at the club, which finished the season 12th in the final league standings. In Karanka's first full season in charge, Middlesbrough finished fourth and thus qualified for the <a href="2015%20Football%20League%20play-offs">2015 Football League play-offs</a>. After seeing off <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> 5–1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the club lost 0–2 to <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> in the final. The next season, Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premier League after finishing second in the Championship in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Football%20League%20Championship">2015–16</a>, drawing 1–1 with <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a> on the final day of the season.
Middlesbrough sacked Karanka in March 2017 following a poor run of form, and the team were relegated in 19th place, after just one season back in the top flight. The team won only 5 league games, and scored 27 goals, the lowest in the league.
Return to the Championship (2017–present).
The club appointed former <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> manager <a href="Garry%20Monk">Garry Monk</a> as manager in the off-season. Expectations at the club were high, having spent close to £50 million in the transfer window on player purchases, in order to mount an immediate promotion challenge back to the Premier League. Monk left in December, with Middlesbrough ninth in the Championship and underachieving, and <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a> was appointed as his replacement. Pulis led the side to finish 5th in the table, which qualified them for the play-offs. They lost in the semi-final to Aston Villa. The <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Middlesbrough%20F.C.%20season">following season</a> Pulis looked to secure the play-offs once again, but a poor finish to the season caused them to finish 7th and miss out on the play-offs by one point.
When Pulis's contract was not extended, he was replaced by former Middlesbrough defender and first team coach, <a href="Jonathan%20Woodgate">Jonathan Woodgate</a> on 14 June 2019 on a three-year contract. From March to June 2020, the 2019–20 season was suspended due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. After a run of only one win in 12 games, which saw the team drop as low as 21st in the table, Woodgate was sacked on 23 June 2020, after a 3–0 defeat to <a href="Swansea%20City">Swansea City</a> in the first game after the restart. Former Cardiff manager <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a> was appointed as his replacement on the same day. Warnock ensured survival from relegation, with a 17th-place finish. On 6 November 2021, Warnock and his assistants, Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson left Middlesbrough by mutual consent, with the club having already identified Warnock's replacement in <a href="Chris%20Wilder">Chris Wilder</a>.
After just over 11 months in charge, Wilder was sacked on 3 October 2022, following a defeat away to bottom-of-the-league <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a> the previous weekend. He was replaced by former Manchester United player <a href="Michael%20Carrick">Michael Carrick</a> three weeks later. In his first job as a head coach, Carrick led Boro to fourth place, but lost in the play-offs against Coventry City.
On 26 May 2023, the club officially became affiliated with the women's team.
In the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20EFL%20Cup">2023–24</a> season, Middlesbrough reached the semi-finals of the League Cup for the first time since 2004. Despite defeating Chelsea in the first leg, Middlesbrough would lose 6–2 on aggregate.
Colours and crest.
Middlesbrough's original home kit upon election to the Football League in 1899 was a white home shirt with red shorts, and they did not adopt their colours of blue and white until later that season. Previous kits included a white shirt with a red and white <a href="polka%20dot">polka dot</a>ted collar from around 1889. The Middlesbrough kit has remained broadly the same since 1899; a red shirt with white detailing, with shorts and socks of either red or white. The distinctive broad white stripe across the chest was introduced by Jack Charlton in 1973 (following an attempt to change the home shirt to a Leeds United-style white shirt), and brought back for a one-off in 1997–98, and, then again, for the 2000–01 and 2004–05 seasons due to popular demand. The club subsequently announced in December 2007 that the club would allow fans to decide via an online and text vote whether the white band should return for the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Middlesbrough%20F.C.%20season">following season</a>. On 8 January 2008, the club announced that, with 77.4% of voters voting in its favour, the white band would return to the home kit, and that fans would choose the final shirt appearance from a selection of three designs, of which the winner was announced on 7 May 2008.
The Middlesbrough crest has gone through four changes since the formation of the club. Initially, the badge was simply the town of Middlesbrough's crest with a red lion instead of a blue lion in order to fit in with the club's colours. Following the adoption of the white band on the shirts in 1973, only the red lion remained with the letters "M.F.C" underneath in red. This was further adapted following the reformation of the club in 1986 to a circular crest with the lion in the middle and the words "Middlesbrough Football Club 1986" around the circle in order to reflect this new era. In 2007, Middlesbrough changed their crest again, this time with the lion inside a shield and the words "Middlesbrough Football Club 1876" underneath. The club's chairman Steve Gibson stated that the intention was to reflect the club's long history and not just their post-liquidation status.
Kit information.
Middlesbrough's first sponsor in 1980 was <a href="Datsun">Datsun</a> Cleveland on a two-year deal. Further two-year deals continued until Dickens was the sponsor for the 1994–95 season only. From 1995 to 2002, the club was sponsored by mobile phone service <a href="Cellnet">Cellnet</a>, followed by two years with mobile retailer <a href="Dial-a-Phone">Dial-a-Phone</a>. Online casino <a href="888.com">888.com</a> (2004–07) and satellite navigation company <a href="Garmin">Garmin</a> (2007–10) followed. In 2010–11, the club had several temporary sponsors including pawnbrokers Ramsdens, who then became permanent sponsors and signed a five-year deal in 2013. At its end, <a href="32Red">32Red</a> became the sponsors. Early in Ramsdens' sponsorship in March 2011, the company ceded its advertising space to <a href="Marie%20Curie%20%28charity%29">Marie Curie Cancer Care</a> for two games.
Italian manufacturers <a href="Erre%C3%A0">Erreà</a> made Middlesbrough's kits from 1994 to 2009, when the role was taken up by <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>, who had previously made the kits from 1979 to 1983. Danish company <a href="Hummel%20International">Hummel</a>, which had made the kits from 1984 to 1987 during the club's winding up and rebirth, secured the contract again in 2018. Erreà returned in 2022.
Stadiums.
After formation in 1876, and with the club still amateurs, Middlesbrough's first two years of football were played at <a href="Albert%20Park%2C%20Middlesbrough">Albert Park</a> in Middlesbrough. After seeing the damage being caused by players and supporters, the Park Committee ordered the club to find an alternate venue. The club moved to Breckon Hill, behind the former <a href="Middlesbrough%20College">Middlesbrough College</a> longlands site, after agreeing to rent the land from its owner. However, two years later in 1880, the owner increased the rent and the club decided to move. They moved into the <a href="Linthorpe%20Road">Linthorpe Road</a> ground in 1882, home at the time of <a href="Middlesbrough%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesbrough Cricket Club</a>. The cricket club departed in 1893–94 to move to the Breckon Hill field, and Middlesbrough Football Club became sole users of the ground.
With the club's growing size, and entry to <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>, they had to move to a new ground in 1903, <a href="Ayresome%20Park">Ayresome Park</a>. It was designed by <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> and would be the club's home for the next 92 years, having also been chosen as one of the stadia for the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 FIFA World Cup</a>. Following the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> in 1990, the ground either needed modernising or the club needed a new stadium. The club decided on the latter, and moved out at the end of the 1994–95 season. Ayresome Park was used as a training ground during 1995–96, before it was demolished in 1997 and a housing estate built in its place. Since the 1990s, the club trains at a £7 million complex at <a href="Rockliffe%20Park%20%28Hurworth%29">Rockliffe Park</a>, in <a href="Hurworth-on-Tees">Hurworth</a>, on the outskirts of <a href="Darlington">Darlington</a>.
The <a href="Riverside%20Stadium">Riverside Stadium</a>, named by the supporters of the club after a vote, became the club's home in 1995. It was the first stadium to be built in line with the Taylor Report's recommendations on all-seater stadiums for clubs in the top two divisions of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. It was originally a 30,000-seater stadium, constructed at a cost of £16 million, before it was expanded in 1998 to a capacity of 35,100 for an extra £5 million.
Since then, several reorganisations of the Riverside Stadium have taken place. At the start of the 2013–14 season, away fans were moved from behind the goal in the South stand to the South East corner, while home fans were situated behind both goals to help create a better atmosphere inside the stadium. A giant TV screen was also installed at the back of the South-East corner, replacing the older style scoreboards attached to the North and South stand roofs. For the start of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Middlesbrough%20F.C.%20season">2016–17 season</a> (and a return to the Premier League), the club had to improve the stadium's broadcasting facilities and floodlighting in order to meet Premier League requirements. The club also took this opportunity to move the main camera gantry to the back of the East stand, so that it faced the main West stand. As of the 2017–18 season, the stadium capacity is 34,742.
Supporters.
Traditionally, supporters come from Middlesbrough itself and towns in the immediate area. As of May 2001, Middlesbrough had one of the highest proportions in Britain of locally-born season ticket holders at 80%, and one of the highest proportions of female fans at 20%. A survey at the start of the 2007–08 season found Middlesbrough supporters were the seventh-loudest set of fans in the Premier League. Middlesbrough Official Supporters Club, which features its own team in the local football league, has links with supporters' clubs across the globe. The largest supporters' clubs include the Official Supporters' Club, the Middlesbrough Disabled Supporters' Association, Yarm Reds, Red Faction and Middlesbrough Supporters South.
For Middlesbrough supporters, their main rivals are <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> (with whom they contest the <a href="Tyne%E2%80%93Tees%20derby">Tyne–Tees derby</a>), followed by <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> (with whom they contest the <a href="Tees%E2%80%93Wear%20derby">Tees–Wear derby</a>), and also, according to a planetfootball.com's 2004 survey, <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>. 
The nickname "<a href="Smoggie">Smoggie</a>s" was first used as a derogatory term by opposing supporters; it relates to the industrial air pollution – smog – that used to hang over the town, but it was later used by Middlesbrough fans in a somewhat self-deprecating manner, before finally being adopted as a badge of pride by supporters of the club. An example of this can be seen on the banners carried to away games stating "Smoggies on Tour". Middlesbrough fans received praise from <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> Chief Executive <a href="Lars-Christer%20Olsson">Lars-Christer Olsson</a> after their behaviour during the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">2005–06 UEFA Cup</a> campaign. He commented that: Middlesbrough fans also received praise from <a href="Cleveland%20Police">Cleveland Police</a> for their behaviour in previous rounds, particularly in the light of aggravation prior to and during the match at <a href="AS%20Roma">Roma</a>.
Media relations.
Middlesbrough was the first football club in the world to launch its own TV channel – Boro TV. The first broadcasts were tied to the club's first ever major cup final appearance in 1997, a full year ahead of Manchester United's MUTV, which still claims to be the first in the world. The channel was the brainchild of then NTL marketing director, Peter Wilcock. The programme became synonymous with former Middlesbrough player Bernie Slaven and radio commentator Alastair Brownlee, who proved to be as popular on TV as they were on radio. Its programmes were not live initially but were pre-recorded and hosted by local radio/TV broadcaster & Boro fan, <a href="Dave%20Roberts%20%28sports%20broadcaster%29">Dave Roberts</a>. In August 2001, Boro TV claimed another first when it became the first English football club to broadcast time-delayed full-match footage of their league games on its own channel. Boro TV ran through <a href="Virgin%20Media">NTL</a> cable television until July 2005. The club then began to show match highlights through a subscription-based scheme on its official website.
Middlesbrough's official <a href="matchday%20programme">matchday programme</a>, "Redsquare", was "Programme Monthly's" 2006–07 Programme of the Year. There are numerous other <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s available, most notably "Fly Me to the Moon", formed in September 1988 following <a href="Bruce%20Rioch">Bruce Rioch</a>'s quote to <a href="Tony%20Mowbray">Tony Mowbray</a>, stating "If I had to go to the <a href="moon">moon</a> I'd want him by my side".
Community.
Middlesbrough Football Club in the Community (MFCIC) was founded in 1996 by club chairman <a href="Steve%20Gibson%20%28businessman%29">Steve Gibson</a> and is one of the largest community-based football schemes in the United Kingdom. It is run separately from the football club, but receives support from both the club in terms of providing players, staff, stadium facilities and <a href="Public%20relations">PR</a> for articles in the matchday programme and other publications, as well as support from other local organisations. In 2012, MFCIC was relaunched as MFC Foundation. The Foundation aims to use the club's profile to deliver sport, health, education and inclusion projects in vulnerable and disadvantaged communities across Teesside. Since 1996, the Foundation has delivered 20,000 qualifications, engaged over 500,000 people and invested £25 million in local communities to tackle inequality and disadvantage.
Since 2002, the club and MFCIC have also run the Middlesbrough Enterprise Academy, a scheme which helps local children improve their entrepreneurial skills and increase their awareness of business planning and finance. In March 2008, plans were announced by the Premier League to roll out the scheme nationally amongst all Premier League clubs.
It was announced in December 2007 that Middlesbrough football club had carried out more community work during <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07</a> than any other <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> club, rising from second place the previous year, with the club making 318 appearances – almost twice the Premier League average of 162. They were in the top two for community appearances again in 2007–08, with 374 – a 17% increase on the previous season.
Middlesbrough's mascot is Roary the Lion. The club runs Roary's Children's Charity Fund, which purchases items for local children's charities.
In 2009, steel producer <a href="Corus%20Group">Corus Group</a> announced the possibility that it would mothball its Teesside plant, with up to 4,000 employees and contractors facing redundancy, after a consortium of steel magnates walked away from a 10-year deal. Middlesbrough Football Club helped with the "Save Our Steel" campaign by hosting dozens of steel workers and their families as they marched around the ground, promoted the campaign via the stadium's PA system, scoreboards and in <a href="matchday%20programme">matchday programme</a>s, while players wore T-shirts during warm-ups promoting the campaign. Chairman <a href="Steve%20Gibson%20%28businessman%29">Steve Gibson</a> said:

Sheffield United F.C.

Sheffield United Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club in <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, <a href="South%20Yorkshire">South Yorkshire</a>, England, that competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, following their promotion from the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20EFL%20Championship">2022–23 EFL Championship</a>. They are nicknamed "the Blades" due to Sheffield's history of cutlery production. The team have played home games at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a> since their formation. For most of the club's history, United have played in red and white striped shirts with black shorts. Their main rivals are <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, with whom they contest the <a href="Steel%20City%20derby">Steel City derby</a>.
Sheffield United was formed as an offshoot of <a href="Sheffield%20United%20Cricket%20Club">Sheffield United Cricket Club</a> in 1889. Following strong performances in the <a href="Midland%20Football%20League%20%281889%29">Midland League</a> and <a href="Northern%20Football%20League">Northern League</a>, they were invited to become founder members of the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a> in 1892. They won <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> at the end of the 1892–93 season, the first team to do so, and went on to be crowned <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">English football champions</a> in 1897–98. United went on to win the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> on four occasions: <a href="1899%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1899</a>, <a href="1902%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1902</a>, <a href="1915%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1915</a> and <a href="1925%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1925</a>; and were beaten finalists in <a href="1901%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1901</a>. They spent 41 years in the top-flight before being relegated in 1934. United finished as FA Cup runners-up in <a href="1936%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1936</a> and were promoted as runners-up of the Second Division in 1938–39.
United won the Second Division title in 1952–53, following relegation in 1949. They spent the next three decades between the First and Second Divisions, winning promotions in 1960–61 and 1970–71 after relegations in 1956 and 1968. However, a slow decline saw the club drop to the fourth tier by 1982, though they would win an immediate promotion as <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> champions in 1981–82; this achievement meant that Sheffield United are one of only five sides to have won <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">all four professional divisions of English football</a>. Promoted in 1983–84, they recovered from relegation in 1988 to win consecutive promotions into the top-flight at the end of the 1989–90 campaign.
Sheffield United were founder members of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">1992–93 season</a>, during which they scored the first ever goal of the competition. They were relegated in 1994 and after losing play-off finals in <a href="1997%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">1997</a> and <a href="2003%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">2003</a>, the club finally regained their Premier League status at the end of the 2005–06 campaign under the stewardship of manager <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a>. However, United were relegated the following year and dropped into <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> in 2011. They spent six seasons in the third tier, losing in three play-offs campaigns, before manager <a href="Chris%20Wilder">Chris Wilder</a> led the club to promotion as champions in 2016–17. Promotion to the Premier League followed in 2018–19, though they returned to the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> in 2021. The club plays in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season, following promotion from the 2022-23 EFL Championship.
History.
Formation and glory years (1888–1975).
The club was formed by members of the <a href="Sheffield%20United%20Cricket%20Club">Sheffield United Cricket Club</a>, formed in 1854 and the first English sports club to use 'United' in its name. Sheffield United's predominant nickname is "The Blades", a reference to Sheffield's status as the major producer of <a href="cutlery">cutlery</a> in the United Kingdom. United's original nickname was in fact "The Cutlers" from 1889–1912. City rivals Wednesday held the nickname "The Blades" in their early years, however in 1907 Wednesday officially became "The Owls", in reference to their new ground in <a href="Owlerton">Owlerton</a>, and United would later claim "The Blades" nickname for themselves.
Sheffield United officially formed on 22 March <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1889</a> at the <a href="Adelphi%20Hotel%20%28Sheffield%29">Adelphi Hotel</a>, <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> (now the site of the <a href="Crucible%20Theatre">Crucible Theatre</a>) by the President of the Cricket Club, <a href="Charles%20Clegg%20%28footballer%29">Sir Charles Clegg</a>. <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">The Wednesday</a> had moved from <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a> to their own ground at <a href="Olive%20Grove">Olive Grove</a> after a dispute over gate receipts and the tenants of Bramall Lane needed to create a new team to generate income. Sir Charles Clegg was incidentally also the president of The Wednesday.
Undoubtedly United's heyday was the 30-year period from 1895–1925, when they were champions of England in <a href="1897%E2%80%9398%20Football%20League">1897–98</a> and runners-up in <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20Football%20League">1896–97</a> and <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20Football%20League">1899–1900</a>, and <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> winners in <a href="1899%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1899</a>, <a href="1902%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1902</a>, <a href="1915%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1915</a> and <a href="1925%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1925</a>. United have not won a trophy since 1925, bar those associated with <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> from lower leagues, their best performances in the cup competitions being several semi-final appearances in the FA Cup and <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a>.
Fall from grace and brief revival (1975–1994).
Their darkest days came between 1975 and 1981. After finishing sixth in the First Division at the end of the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75 season</a>, they were relegated to the Second Division <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football">the following season</a>, and <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20in%20English%20football">three years after that setback</a> they fell into the Third Division. They reached an absolute low in 1981 when they were relegated to the Fourth Division, but were champions in their <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20in%20English%20football">first season</a> in the league's basement division and <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20in%20English%20football">two years afterwards</a> they won promotion to the Second Division.
They fell back into the Third Division in 1988, but new manager <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a> masterminded a quick revival which launched the Blades towards one of the most successful eras in their history. Successive promotions in the aftermath of the 1988 relegation saw them return to the First Division in 1990 after a 14-year exile. They survived at this level for four seasons (being founder members of the new <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992 after peaking with a ninth-place finish in the last season of the old First Division) and reached an F.A. Cup semi-final in the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Cup">1992–93</a> season before being relegated in 1994.
Financial trouble and fall to League One (1994–2013).
They remained outside the top flight for the next 12 years, although they qualified for the play-offs under Bassett's successor <a href="Howard%20Kendall">Howard Kendall</a> in 1997 and caretaker manager <a href="Steve%20Thompson%20%28footballer%20born%201955%29">Steve Thompson</a> in 1998. They were struggling at the wrong end of Division One when <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a> was appointed manager in December 1999, and a financial crisis was preventing the club from being able to boost their squad, but in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03</a> they enjoyed their most successful season for a decade, reaching the semi-finals of both domestic cups and also reaching the Division One play-off final, where they were beaten 3–0 by <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>. Three years later, however, Warnock delivered a Premier League return as the Blades finished runners-up in the re-branded <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>. They lasted just one season back amongst the elite, before being relegated from the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> amidst the controversy surrounding <a href="Carlos%20Tevez">Carlos Tevez</a>, the player who was controversially signed by <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> and whose performances played a big part in their remarkable escape from relegation. <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a> resigned as manager after the Blades went down. The team also purchased Chinese club <a href="Chengdu%20Blades%20F.C.">Chengdu Wuniu</a> in 2006, and redesigned the club crest in the style of the Sheffield United badge and renamed the team "Chengdu Blades". The team were dissolved in 2015.
The club struggled to come to terms with life back in the Championship, with a spiralling wage bill not being matched by the quality of the players brought in, and a succession of managers within a short period of time. The Blades reached the Championship playoff final in 2009 under <a href="Kevin%20Blackwell">Kevin Blackwell</a>, but a period of decline then set in. The 2010–11 season proved disastrous, with the club employing three different managers in the span of a season, which ultimately ended in relegation to <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> under <a href="Micky%20Adams">Micky Adams</a>, meaning they would play in the third tier of English football for the first time since 1989. United qualified for the <a href="EFL%20League%20One%20play-offs">League One play-offs</a> in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Sheffield%20United%20F.C.%20season">2011–12</a> and <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Sheffield%20United%20F.C.%20season">2012–13</a> but lost in the <a href="2012%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">final</a> and semi-final respectively.
Saudi Takeover and return to the top flight (2013–present).
In September 2013, <a href="Abdullah%20bin%20Musaid%20Al%20Saud">Abdullah bin Musaid Al Saud</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Saud">House of Saud</a> had bought a 50 per cent stake in United's parent company "Blades Leisure Ltd". Both parties, at that time, agreed to include a "roulette notice" mechanism to end their arrangement when they no longer wished to work together. In 2014, United reached the F.A. Cup semi-final at Wembley but lost 5–3 to <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a>. In <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">2014–15</a>, the team reached the quarter-finals of the F.A. Cup and semi-final of the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a>. United secured promotion back to the second tier in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Sheffield%20United%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a> under the management of lifelong United fan and former player <a href="Chris%20Wilder">Chris Wilder</a>, winning the League One title with 100 points. In late 2017, co-owner <a href="Kevin%20McCabe%20%28businessman%29">Kevin McCabe</a> served a roulette notice on Prince Abdullah, giving him the option to sell his 50 per cent at £5 million or buy McCabe's 50 per cent for the same price. Prince Abdullah chose to buy but McCabe refused to sell, a decision that ended up before the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court of Justice</a>.
In the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Sheffield%20United%20F.C.%20season">2018–19</a> season, Sheffield United achieved automatic promotion to the Premier League. United's first season back in the Premier League, despite being tipped by many for relegation, produced a ninth-place finish. Despite this, ownership disputes between Prince Abdullah and McCabe continued. In September 2019, after 20 months of litigation, the High Court issued its judgment, requiring McCabe's company to sell its shares in United. McCabe sought permission to appeal from the High Court and Court of Appeal but both appeals were rejected. As a result, Prince Abdullah became the sole beneficial owner of the club. In the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Sheffield%20United%20F.C.%20season">2020–21</a> season, the club made a very poor start to the season, taking just one win in their opening eighteen matches. Wilder left the club by mutual consent in March 2021. He was replaced by <a href="Paul%20Heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> as caretaker manager, who could not prevent relegation at the end of the season. In May 2021, the club appointed <a href="Slavi%C5%A1a%20Jokanovi%C4%87">Slaviša Jokanović</a> as the new manager, making him the first overseas manager the club's history. However, Jokanović was dismissed in November 2021 after a poor start to the season and Heckingbottom was reappointed as manager, this time on a permanent basis. Heckingbottom appointed former Sheffield United players <a href="Stuart%20McCall">Stuart McCall</a> and <a href="Jack%20Lester">Jack Lester</a> as part of his coaching team. The <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Sheffield%20United%20F.C.%20season">2021–22</a> season resulted in a fifth place finish in the Championship, losing in the play-off semi-finals to Nottingham Forest on penalties. The following <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Sheffield%20United%20F.C.%20season">season</a>, Heckingbottom guided United back to the Premier League, securing automatic promotion from a second place finish. The team also reached the F.A. Cup Semi-final, losing 3–0 to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>.
United's return to the Premier League for the 2023/24 season proved to be difficult and by early December the team was bottom of the League. The Club's Board decided to sack Paul Heckingbottom, replacing him with former Blades manager, Chris Wilder.
Kits, colours and crest.
Sheffield United have played in red and white stripes for most of their history, but began playing in white shirts and blue shorts. They briefly played in narrow red stripes for the 1890–91 season, before returning to all-white the following year. The stripes returned in the 1892–93 season, with black shorts replacing the blue in 1904. The shirts remained largely unchanged until collars were first removed in 1955, replaced by V-necks until the 1966–67 season (when white socks were also used), and from here on the neck style varied.
The traditional red and white stripes remained until the 1974–75 season, when elements of black were added, until the 1979–81 and 82 season kit. This was white with a red breast, and with thin stripes down either side, and was created to accommodate the logo of the club's principal sponsor, Cantor's, a local furniture shop. This was to be replaced by a striped kit, with the sponsor Bentley's (1981–82) and <a href="Renault">Renault</a> (1982–83) written vertically down a white stripe over the left-hand side. Their kits continued to feature striped shirts, albeit with various aids to accommodate their sponsors, including a yellow square for <a href="Arnold%20Laver">Laver</a> from 1988–92 (the 1990–92 shirt also featured narrow black stripes through each white stripe) and a black hoop, also for Laver in the 1994–95 season. Then came the diamond kit, which was so badly received that the club reverted to stripes the following season. Since then, red and white stripes and black socks with varying trim have been the order of the day, with black shorts for all but the 2002–05 seasons, when white and then red were tried. The club also every few seasons opt to put thin black stripes between the red and white stripes. Sheffield United's home colours were the inspiration for the kit of Irish club, <a href="Derry%20City%20F.C.">Derry City</a>. In 1934, Derry City adopted the stripes, while <a href="Billy%20Gillespie">Billy Gillespie</a> was manager of the club, in recognition of Gillespie's achievements at Sheffield United.
The first time a crest appeared on the shirt was in the 1891–92 season, when a red crest appeared on the white shirt, but this disappeared the following season. United used the city of Sheffield's <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> from 1965–77, when a new crest was used, introduced by former manager <a href="Jimmy%20Sirrel">Jimmy Sirrel</a>, but designed apparently over 20 years previously by former player <a href="Jimmy%20Hagan">Jimmy Hagan</a>. This consisted of two white crossed swords, or blades, the club's nickname, with a <a href="Yorkshire%20Rose">Yorkshire Rose</a> above, on a black background. This is surrounded by a red ring with "Sheffield United F.C." written around the top and "<a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1889</a>", the year the club was founded, underneath. This has been altered very slightly a few times, with a simple black embroidered crest appearing on shirts from 1987–90, and an all-white crest on a red-edged black shield for the 1992–99 seasons, but reverted to its original form in 2000.
Ground.
Sheffield United play at <a href="Bramall%20Lane">Bramall Lane</a>, near the centre of Sheffield. Bramall Lane is the oldest major league ground anywhere in the world, having hosted its first game in 1862, a match between <a href="Hallam%20F.C.">Hallam</a> and <a href="Sheffield%20F.C.">Sheffield Club</a>. Bramall Lane also hosted the world's first ever floodlit football match on 14 October 1878 with two teams picked from the Sheffield Football Association. The power for the lights was provided by two generators. The crowd was 20,000 and the score 2–0.
Bramall Lane was originally a cricket ground and in 1855 it was leased to Sheffield United Cricket Club (founded in 1854) by the <a href="Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a>. The ground was opened with a cricket match on 30 April 1855 and later became a shared cricket/football venue. After <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire County Cricket Club</a> was founded in 1863, it was their main venue in the nineteenth century. They continued to use the ground for some matches each season until 7 August 1973, after which construction work began to convert Bramall Lane into a specialist football stadium.
The ground has seen expansion in recent years, with the 2006 completion of a 3,000 seat corner stand, Bramall Lane is now an all-seater stadium fit for the Premier League holding 31,884.
In March 2009 the club were officially granted permission to expand the stadium once again, over two phases. The first phase would have seen the Kop being extended to increase the ground's capacity up to approximately 37,000. It would also have seen the removal of the main supporting pillars and a giant screen installed as part of the stand's roof. The second phase would have seen the Valad Stand (formerly Arnold Laver Stand) also extended, bringing the total capacity to a 40,000 all seater. The expansion would also have had a secondary focus of being available for selection for <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> matches in 2018 or 2022, if England's bid were to be successful. However, on 16 December 2009 <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> announced that should England's 2018/2022 World Cup bid be successful then any games played in Sheffield would be staged at <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday">Sheffield Wednesday</a>'s <a href="Hillsborough%20Stadium">Hillsborough Stadium</a>. In light of this United's former chief executive, <a href="Trevor%20Birch">Trevor Birch</a>, made it known that all planned ground redevelopment had been put on hold until the club was able to regain and maintain Premiership status.
A revised application for the redevelopment of Kop was submitted in 2015, which would see 3,215 seats added to the stand's current capacity. Further plans were revealed in 2017 for the development of the corner between the Kop and South Stand, which would see the construction of residential flats and a new club store.
Supporters and rivalries.
Sheffield United derive support from a broad cross-section of the city and its environs, with branches of the official supporters' club running from <a href="Swinton%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Swinton</a>, <a href="Kiveton%20Park">Kiveton Park</a>, <a href="Retford">Retford</a>, and <a href="Eckington%2C%20Derbyshire">Eckington</a>. Further afield, supporters groups also exist in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, and <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, amongst others.
A 2013 study of posts on social networking site <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> found that Blades fans have the most positive interactions with the official account of their club out of any in English football. Sheffield United were also found to have the most 'obsessed' fans in the 2006–07 Premier League, with supporters reportedly thinking about the team 110 times a day on average.
United have a number of celebrity supporters including:
Rivalries.
Sheffield United have numerous <a href="Sports%20rivalry">rivalries</a>, mostly with other <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> clubs. The most notable rivalry is with their city neighbours <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, with whom they contest the <a href="Steel%20City%20derby">Steel City derby</a> (named after the steel industry for which the city of <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> is globally famous).
Sheffield United's next main rival is <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> from West Yorkshire. This is known as a Yorkshire derby match (the two cities of Sheffield and Leeds are the largest two cities in Yorkshire). Their other main rivals are the professional clubs of South Yorkshire; <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a>, <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a> and <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a>. These matches are known as South Yorkshire derbies.
Sheffield United also have a rivalry with <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>. This can be attributed to the miners' strikes of the 1980s, where workers in the <a href="Colliery">pits</a> of <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> did not join the strike (known locally as <a href="Strikebreaker">scabbing</a>) while miners from Yorkshire did.
<a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> have also become fierce rivals due to the <a href="Carlos%20Tevez%23Sheffield%20United%20controversy">'Tevez saga'</a> and the following lawsuit charges.
Chants.
Like many English clubs, Sheffield United supporters have a wide variety of chants and songs. The most famous of these is "<a href="The%20Greasy%20Chip%20Butty%20Song">The Greasy Chip Butty Song</a>", sung to the tune of <a href="John%20Denver">John Denver</a>'s '<a href="Annie%27s%20Song">Annie's Song</a>'.

Player of the Year.
A 'Player of the Year' award has been presented since 1967 to recognise the player who has made the greatest contribution to the club over the course of the season. Initially organised by the Official Supporters Club the award was voted for by their members although it was presented as an official club award. In recent years the award has been presented at a gala 'End of Season' award ceremony and dinner, usually held at the end of April, and voting has been widened to include a broader section of the club's fanbase. The first winner of the award was long serving goalkeeper <a href="Alan%20Hodgkinson">Alan Hodgkinson</a>. The player with the most award wins is striker <a href="Alan%20Woodward">Alan Woodward</a> on four occasions between 1970 and 1978. The longest gap between wins by a player is seven years; <a href="Keith%20Edwards%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201957%29">Keith Edwards</a> had two spells with the club and won the award during both, in 1977 and 1984. <a href="Harry%20Maguire">Harry Maguire</a> and <a href="Phil%20Jagielka">Phil Jagielka</a> have won the award on three consecutive occasions. The award was shared between two players for the first time in 2017, with <a href="Billy%20Sharp">Billy Sharp</a> and <a href="John%20Fleck%20%28footballer%29">John Fleck</a> receiving the award.
Development squads and women's team.
Academy.
Sheffield United's Academy is responsible for youth development at the club. It has produced such players as <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> defender <a href="Kyle%20Walker">Kyle Walker</a> and defender <a href="Phil%20Jagielka">Phil Jagielka</a>, both <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England internationals</a>, and also <a href="Swansea%20City">Swansea City</a> defender <a href="Kyle%20Naughton">Kyle Naughton</a>, <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> full back <a href="Matthew%20Lowton">Matthew Lowton</a>, <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a> defender and club captain <a href="Harry%20Maguire">Harry Maguire</a> and current club captain <a href="Billy%20Sharp">Billy Sharp</a>. The Academy building and training facilities in the Sheffield suburb of <a href="Shirecliffe">Shirecliffe</a> were opened in 2002 by then <a href="Minister%20for%20Sport">Minister for Sport</a> <a href="Richard%20Caborn">Richard Caborn</a>. <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.%20Academy">Sheffield United Academy U18s</a> currently play in the Professional Development League at the Shirecliffe ground at Firshill Crescent, and finished as runners-up in the 2011 <a href="FA%20Youth%20Cup">FA Youth Cup</a>. In addition, SteelPhalt are the sponsor of the Shirecliffe-based Academy, and are also the major sponsor of Sheffield United Women.
Under 23s.
Sheffield United U23s currently compete in the Professional Development League, playing home games at various venues, including Bramall Lane and Stocksbridge Park Steels FC. The club have fielded a reserve team since 1893, when the reserves played in 'Sheffield League Division One'.
United Women.
Sheffield United also have a <a href="Sheffield%20United%20W.F.C.">Women's team</a>, formerly known as Sheffield United Ladies, who play in the <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20Championship">FA Women's Championship</a> after having been promoted in the 2017–18 season from the FA Women's National League. Sheffield United Women also have a Development team and numerous junior teams as part of the Regional Talent Club and an additional grassroots arm.
Club management.
Managerial history.
At its formation in 1889 United did not employ what would today be termed a <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a>, the side was coached by a trainer and a football committee selected the team and decided upon tactics (this was a continuation of the structure of <a href="Sheffield%20United%20Cricket%20Club">Sheffield United Cricket Club</a> from which the football team had been formed). They did appoint <a href="Joseph%20Wostinholm">Joseph Wostinholm</a> to the position of club secretary and he was responsible for the day-to-day running of the club, matchday organisation and dealing with players and contracts. Wostinholm oversaw a period of rapid growth for the team, culminating in 1898 when United won their only First Division championship, after which he retired. Wostinholm was replaced by <a href="John%20Nicholson%20%28football%20secretary%29">John Nicholson</a> as secretary and he would remain in post for over thirty years until his death in 1932. Nicholson presided over the most successful period in the club's history as United became a leading force in English football, winning the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> four times and regularly challenged at the top of the league but a second Division One title for the club eluded him.
A new era.
Following the death of John Nicholson (who died whilst travelling to an away match in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>) the United board turned to <a href="Chesterfield%20F.C.">Chesterfield</a> manager <a href="Teddy%20Davison">Teddy Davison</a> to become the club's first real manager. The team were in decline however and were soon relegated for the first time in their history. Davison gradually rebuilt the side with astute signings and young players and regained top flight status, but the club's post-war financial problems would hamper team building for years to come. Davison retired in 1952 and prompted the club to appoint <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a> manager <a href="Reg%20Freeman">Reg Freeman</a> as his successor. Freeman stabilised the team but fell ill and died in 1955 after which United turned to the inexperienced <a href="Joe%20Mercer">Joe Mercer</a> but he struggled to cope with a team in decline and departed for <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> in 1958. United then appointed <a href="Chester%20F.C.">Chester</a> manager <a href="John%20Harris%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29">John Harris</a> who inherited a talented but under performing side which he transformed into a promotion team, returning to Division One in 1961. Harris built a side based on local players and stabilised them in the top flight but financial issues soon prompted the sale of key players and United were eventually relegated once more. Harris opted to 'move upstairs' to become 'general manager' and handed the role of team manager to <a href="Arthur%20Rowley">Arthur Rowley</a> but he was sacked after one season following disappointing results. Harris returned as manager and guided the side to promotion once more but after a good start back in the top flight Harris' confidence faded and he stepped down in 1973 to 'move upstairs' for the second time.
Rapid decline.
Experienced <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> manager <a href="Ken%20Furphy">Ken Furphy</a> was the man United turned to replace John Harris. He initially did well but the team was ageing and there was little money to replace players. After a good finish in his first season a disastrous string of results the following year led to Furphy's sacking in October 1975. <a href="Jimmy%20Sirrel">Jimmy Sirrel</a> was recruited from <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> but he proved unpopular with both the players and fans and could not halt the decline, overseeing relegation and then being sacked in September 1977 with United at the bottom of Division Two. The ambitious and colourful <a href="Harry%20Haslam%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201921%29">Harry Haslam</a> was handed the <a href="rein">rein</a>s and although many of his ideas were ahead of their time he built an ageing side based on 'star' players at the end of their career. Now in the Third Division performances deteriorated still further and Haslam stepped down due to illness in January 1981. World Cup winner and then United player <a href="Martin%20Peters">Martin Peters</a> was promoted to the position of manager but United were relegated to Division Four at the end of the season and Peters resigned.
Moving on up.
With a new ambitious board in place United recruited <a href="Ian%20Porterfield">Ian Porterfield</a> as manager in June 1981. He had an immediate impact, winning the Division Four championship in his first season and taking the club back into the second tier two years later on a meagre budget. Despite this many fans were unhappy with the style of football and odd team selections and Porterfield was sacked in 1986 following supporter protests. Coach <a href="Billy%20McEwan%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201951%29">Billy McEwan</a> was promoted to the position of manager but failed to improve the standard of play and with attendances falling and the team in danger of relegation once more he was sacked in January 1988. United now turned to the colourful character of <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a> who had most recently had a short, unsuccessful spell as manager of <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>. It was to prove an astute appointment as although he could not prevent relegation in his first season he built a solid, hard working team on a small budget and won back to back promotions, returning the club to the top flight and achieving regular mid-table finishes. With the formation of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> United's old financial problems and willingness to sell star players without replacing them meant the side eventually succumbed to relegation and when an immediate return was not forthcoming Basset was sacked in December 1995.
Comings and goings.
The following years proved a turbulent time for United as they chased the ambition of Premiership football. Experienced <a href="Howard%20Kendall">Howard Kendall</a> was recruited as manager and undertook a complete rebuilding of the side but left in June 1997 to take over at <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. Player-coach <a href="Nigel%20Spackman">Nigel Spackman</a> was promoted to replace Kendall but after initial promise he quit after only eight months citing boardroom interference. This was to become a recurring theme and replacement <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> would leave after only one season citing the same reasons. <a href="Adrian%20Heath">Adrian Heath</a> then proved a disastrous appointment and lasted only six months before being sacked with United looking more likely to be relegated than promoted. The Blades then turned to experienced lower league manager <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a> who managed to stave off relegation and began to rebuild the side on a meagre budget. Warnock proved a divisive figure with fans, but after a number of mid-table finishes he achieved promotion back to the Premiership in 2006. The side were relegated the following season, prompting the board not to renew Warnock's contract.
Just like Adrian Heath, the appointment of <a href="Bryan%20Robson">Bryan Robson</a> in 2007 proved an unpopular and unsuccessful one and he was sacked after less than a year following poor results and intense fan pressure. Former assistant manager <a href="Kevin%20Blackwell">Kevin Blackwell</a> was appointed as Robson's replacement but despite reaching the play-off finals in his first full season the team was obviously in decline and he was sacked after only two games of the 2010–11 season. Worse was to come however as player-coach <a href="Gary%20Speed">Gary Speed</a> was briefly promoted to manager but left after only a few months to take over <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">the Welsh national side</a>. <a href="Micky%20Adams">Micky Adams</a> then became the third full-time manager of the season, and oversaw a disastrous run of results which saw United relegated and Adams sacked after only six months in charge.
With United in the third tier once more, <a href="Danny%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201960%29">Danny Wilson</a> was appointed as manager in June 2011, despite protests from United fans over his previous association with cross-town rivals <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>. Wilson guided the club to the <a href="2012%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">League One play-off final</a> in his first full season in charge, only to lose to <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> after a famous penalty shootout in which Huddersfield missed their first three penalties. Despite the club challenging for promotion the following season, a poor run of results led to Wilson's departure in April 2013, being replaced by <a href="Chris%20Morgan%20%28footballer%29">Chris Morgan</a> until the end of the season.
After a long search for a new boss, former Scotland defender <a href="David%20Weir%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29">David Weir</a> was appointed as Wilson's long-term replacement. Weir's tenure was short-lived however, as he was sacked in October of the same year, having won only one of 13 games in charge. After Chris Morgan had overseen the team for a brief time, <a href="Nigel%20Clough">Nigel Clough</a> was appointed as Weir's permanent successor in October 2013. Clough guided the Blades to finish seventh in the table narrowly missing the play-offs after having been bottom of the table at the start of February and also led United to an FA Cup semi-final against <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> which the Blades lost 5–3 after twice taking the lead in the first half. 
The following season saw Clough guide the Blades to fifth place in the league, thus qualifying for the play-offs and also led them to a first League Cup semi-final in 12 years, with the Blades ultimately losing to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 3–2 on aggregate. United failed to gain promotion through the play-offs after losing to <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a> 2–1 in the first leg and drawing 5–5 in the second leg (7–6 on aggregate).
Following their failure to gain promotion, Clough was sacked on 25 May 2015 and on 2 June 2015, former <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a>, <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> and <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> boss <a href="Nigel%20Adkins">Nigel Adkins</a> was appointed as the new Blades manager. However, his appointment only lasted one season as the Blades (who were in 2nd place after the first five matches) ultimately finished in 11th place, the club's lowest finish in the third tier since 1983. Adkins was duly sacked on 12 May 2016. 
Atkins was quickly replaced by former <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a> manager and former Blades player <a href="Chris%20Wilder">Chris Wilder</a>, who oversaw United's promotion from League One in 2017, after six years in the division, and its subsequent return to the Premier League in 2019.
United went on to finish ninth in their first season back in the top flight, but the following 2020–21 season was a completely different story. On 13 March 2021, Wilder left the club by mutual consent, with the club bottom of the Premier League, with 14 points from 28 games. U23 coach <a href="Paul%20Heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> took interim charge of the team until the end of the season but United were still relegated.
On 27 May 2021, former Fulham boss <a href="Slavi%C5%A1a%20Jokanovi%C4%87">Slaviša Jokanović</a> was appointed by United on a three-year deal, becoming the club's first manager from overseas. However he was sacked on 25 November 2021, after United had only won six of 19 Championship games.
Heckingbottom was subsequently appointed manager of Sheffield United, this time on a permanent basis, and eventually guided United to the FA Cup semi-finals in 2023, and back to the Premier League for the 2023/24 season.
United struggled on their return to the Premier League for the 2023/24 season and by early December the team was bottom of the League. Paul Heckingbottom was sacked and replaced by former Blades manager, Chris Wilder.

The club suffered relegation in 1933, but secured promotion as <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a> champions in 1934. They won the Third Division North title for a second time in 1939, having been relegated the previous season. Relegated again in 1953, they secured another Third Division North title in 1955. However, further relegations left them in the fourth tier of English football by 1966. Promotion from the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> was achieved in 1968, though they were relegated after just four seasons. The club secured two promotions in three years under the stewardship of <a href="Allan%20Clarke%20%28footballer%29">Allan Clarke</a> and <a href="Norman%20Hunter%20%28footballer%29">Norman Hunter</a>, and from 1981 would spend sixteen consecutive years in the second tier.
<a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> football was secured for the 1997–98 season with a second place finish in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, though they were relegated after one season and dropped down to the third tier in 2002. Barnsley won the <a href="2006%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">2006 League One play-off final</a> and remained in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> for eight seasons. Relegated in 2014, they won both the <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">2016 Football League Trophy final</a> and the <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">2016 League One play-off final</a>, though this time spent just two seasons in the Championship. In 2017, a majority stake in the club was sold to a consortium that included <a href="Chien%20Lee">Chien Lee</a>, Neerav Parekh and <a href="Billy%20Beane">Billy Beane</a>. Barnsley won promotion from League One with a second-place finish in 2019, before being relegated out of the Championship again in 2022. Barnsley have spent more seasons and played more games at the second level of English football than any other team. The club's main rivals are fellow Yorkshire clubs <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>, <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> and <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a>.
History.
Beginnings and FA Cup glory.
Barnsley were established in 1887 as Barnsley St Peter's by <a href="Tiverton%20Preedy">Reverend Tiverton Preedy</a>, and they played in the Sheffield and District League from 1890 and in the <a href="Midland%20League%20%281889%29">Midland League</a> from 1895. In 1897, the club dropped the St Peter's part of its name to become simply Barnsley. They joined <a href="English%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> in 1898, and struggled in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> for the first decade, due in part to ongoing financial difficulties. In 1910, the club reached the <a href="1910%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a>, where they were defeated by <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. In 1912, they reached the FA Cup final again, and defeated <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> <a href="1912%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1–0</a> to win the trophy for the first time in their history. When league football restarted after the First World War, the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Football%20League">1919–20</a> season brought some significant changes to the league. The main difference was that the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> would now have 22 teams, rather than 20. The bottom team from the previous season was <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and they were <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a>. The first extra place in the First Division went to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, who retained their place despite finishing second bottom and therefore in the relegation places. <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> and <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> were <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promoted</a> from the Second Division which left one place to be filled.
Having finished the previous season's Second Division in third place, Barnsley expected to achieve First Division status for the first time, but the Football League instead chose to call a ballot of the clubs. The League voted to promote sixth-placed Arsenal, for reasons of history over merit. <a href="Henry%20Norris%20%28businessman%29">Sir Henry Norris</a>, the then <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> chairman, argued that Arsenal be promoted for their "long service to league football", having been the first League club from the South of England. It has been alleged that this was due to backroom deals and even outright bribery by Sir Henry Norris, colluding with his friend John McKenna, the chairman of Liverpool and the Football League, who recommended Arsenal's promotion at the AGM. No conclusive proof of wrongdoing has come to light, though other aspects of Norris's financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter. Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929, having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities; he was found to have misused his expenses account, and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus.
Pre-war and post-war era.
The club came close to reaching the First Division in their early years. In the <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20Football%20League">1921–22</a> season, they missed out on promotion by <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>. During the 1930s and 1940s years, the club found themselves sliding between the Second and <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>. In 1949, the club signed <a href="Danny%20Blanchflower">Danny Blanchflower</a> from <a href="Glentoran%20F.C.">Glentoran</a>, and he impressed at <a href="Oakwell">Oakwell</a> that two years later he was signed by First Division side <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, later signing for Tottenham Hotspur and being voted <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Player of the Year</a> twice, as well as being the <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> of the 20th century's first <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">league and cup double</a> winning team in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1960–61</a>. Around the time of Blanchflower's departure, a young centre-forward called <a href="Tommy%20Taylor">Tommy Taylor</a> broke into the Barnsley team, scoring 26 goals in 44 games. In April 1953, he became one of the most expensive players in English football at the time when <a href="Matt%20Busby">Sir Matt Busby</a> signed him for <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> for a fee of £29,999. Taylor went on to be a prolific goalscorer at the highest level over the next five years, winning two league titles and scoring 16 goals in 19 appearances for the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national football team</a>, before losing his life in the <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a> on 6 February 1958.
When the Northern and Southern sections of the Third Division were replaced by national Third and <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Divisions</a> for the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59 season</a>, Barnsley were still in the Second Division, but went down to the Third Division at the end of the season. In 1965, Barnsley were relegated to the Football League Fourth Division for the first time, winning promotion <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Football%20League">three years later</a>. They went down to the Fourth Division again in 1972, and this time stayed down for seven seasons, finally returning to the Third Division in 1979. Two years later, they went up again and quickly established themselves as a decent Second Division side throughout the 1980s, although they still failed to clinch that elusive First Division place, despite the introduction of the <a href="English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-offs</a> in the second half of the decade, which gave teams finishing as low as fifth and eventually sixth the chance of winning promotion.
Division One and the Premier League.
For the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95</a> season, Barnsley turned to midfielder <a href="Danny%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201960%29">Danny Wilson</a> to manage the club. His first season brought a sixth-place finish in the First Division, which would normally have meant a play-off place, but a restructuring of the league meant that they missed out. They finished 10th a year later before finally emerging as serious promotion contenders in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1996–97 season</a>, finally clinching runners-up spot and automatic promotion and gaining the top flight place that they had spent 99 years trying to win. Barnsley lasted just one season in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> but they did reach the quarter-finals of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, defeating Manchester United in the fifth round. They also made their record signing that season with <a href="Gjorgji%20Hristov">Gjorgji Hristov</a> for £2 million. Wilson then departed to take over at <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, being succeeded as Barnsley manager by striker <a href="John%20Hendrie%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29">John Hendrie</a>, who had been a key player in the promotion-winning team. Barnsley were the only team from outside the Premier League to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20FA%20Cup">1998–99 season</a>, but only finished 13th in the league. Hendrie was then replaced as manager by <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a>, who rejuvenated the team and took them to fourth place in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a>. The team <a href="2000%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">lost in the play-off final</a> to <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>, the last play-off final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> before the stadium was closed for redevelopment.
Mixed fortunes in the 21st century.
The team were relegated to the Second Division in 2002; <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> threatened the existence of the club as Barnsley suffered greatly due to the <a href="ITV%20Digital">ITV Digital</a> crisis. A late purchase by Barnsley's then mayor, Peter Doyle, saved the club from folding. In 2006, the side won in the <a href="2006%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a> at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, where they beat <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a> 4–3 on <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a> to earn promotion to the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>. The manager at this time was <a href="Andy%20Ritchie%20%28English%20footballer%29">Andy Ritchie</a>, who was in his first season in charge after replacing <a href="Paul%20Hart">Paul Hart</a>. The team struggled in their first season back in the Championship. In November 2006, with Barnsley in the relegation zone, Ritchie was sacked in favour of <a href="Simon%20Davey">Simon Davey</a>, who managed to steer the team away from relegation in the second half of the season, and they eventually finished 20th. The following season, Barnsley reached the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20FA%20Cup">semi-final of the FA Cup</a>, beating Premier League side <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> 2–1 at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> and defending champions <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> 1–0; the team lost 1–0 against fellow Championship side <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a> in the semi-final. In October 2008, the club fielded the youngest player in the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a>'s history when <a href="Reuben%20Noble-Lazarus">Reuben Noble-Lazarus</a> came on against <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> aged 15 years and 45 days.
Barnsley ended the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Barnsley%20F.C.%20season">2011–12</a> season as one of only two football clubs to turn a profit in the Championship; they stayed up only because <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> were given a 10-point deduction for going into administration. In 2016, Barnsley won the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> after a <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">3–2 win</a> against <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a>. They gained promotion to the Championship following a 3–1 win over <a href="Millwall">Millwall</a> in the <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a> later that season. In September 2016, Barnsley were caught up in <a href="2016%20English%20football%20scandal">an ongoing scandal</a> in English football, with assistant manager <a href="Tommy%20Wright%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201966%29">Tommy Wright</a> alleged to have accepted "bungs" in exchange for working as an ambassador for a third-party player ownership consortium. Wright was initially suspended before being sacked by Barnsley.
New ownership.
In December 2017, Patrick Cryne and his family sold an 80% stake in the club to NewCity Capital's <a href="Chien%20Lee">Chien Lee</a> and Pacific Media Group's Paul Conway; they were joined by Indian investor Neerav Parekh and executive vice president of baseball operations and minority owner of the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, <a href="Billy%20Beane">Billy Beane</a> (famous from the <a href="Moneyball%20%28film%29">Moneyball film</a>), as part of the international investor consortium. Barnsley were relegated to the third tier in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Barnsley%20F.C.%20season">2017–18</a>; afterwards. the new owners used a data approach to identify talents, focusing on young players and team rebuilding. The club appointed <a href="Daniel%20Stendel">Daniel Stendel</a> as head coach, who played high pressing football; Barnsley were promoted back to the Championship the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Barnsley%20F.C.%20season">following season</a>. In the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Barnsley%20F.C.%20season">2019–20 season</a>, under new coach <a href="Gerhard%20Struber">Gerhard Struber</a>, Barnsley avoided relegation from the Championship. In <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Barnsley%20F.C.%20season">2020–21</a>, under the management of <a href="Val%C3%A9rien%20Isma%C3%ABl">Valérien Ismaël</a>, Barnsley finished in fifth place and made it to the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20EFL%20Championship%23Play-offs">EFL Championship Play-offs</a> for the first time in 24 years, with the youngest squad and one of the smallest budgets in the league. "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" called Barnsley a "<a href="Moneyball">Moneyball</a> experiment".
Prior to the 2021–22 season, <a href="Markus%20Schopp">Markus Schopp</a> was revealed as the new head coach. In November 2021, Schopp was sacked after a run of seven straight defeats. Three weeks later <a href="Poya%20Asbaghi">Poya Asbaghi</a> was appointed as the new head coach. Fortunes improved little as Barnsley were relegated from the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20EFL%20Championship">2021–22 EFL Championship</a> following a 2–1 defeat against <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>. Asbaghi left the club by mutual consent shortly afterwards. On 15 June 2022, <a href="Michael%20Duff%20%28footballer%29">Michael Duff</a> was appointed head coach of Barnsley FC on a three-year deal.
In May 2022, it was revealed that Pacific Media Group did not actually own all the shares they claimed to own, and were simply a nominee for a group of 4 investors who owned 20% of the club. Following this revelation, Neerav Parekh purchased the shares of 2 of the investors, while Matt Edmonds purchased the shares of the 4th investor. Following the purchases and further equity raises, the new ownership of the club is now understood to be split between Neerav Parekh (55.59%), the Cryne family (21.30%), Julie Anne Quay and Matt Edmonds (10%), Chien Lee (9.20%),and Conway’s company Pacific Media Group (3.91%). With this reconstituted shareholding and a loss of majority control, Paul Conway, Chien Lee, Grace Hung and Dickson Lee were voted off the board of Barnsley Football Club, and were replaced by Jean Cryne and Julie Anne Quay in May 2022. In July 2023, the EFL charged Barnsley with 5 breaches of the EFL Regulations related to the ownership of the club under Conway and Lee's tenure, whilst also charging Conway and Lee individually with causing these breaches in regulations.
Stadium.
The stadium's name, Oakwell, originates from the well and oak tree that were on the site when first built. Oakwell is a multi-purpose sports development in <a href="Barnsley">Barnsley</a>, South Yorkshire, used primarily by the club for playing its home fixtures, and its reserves. While the name 'Oakwell' generally refers to the main stadium, it also includes several neighbouring venues which form the facilities of the Barnsley academy – an indoor training pitch, a smaller stadium with seating on the south and west sides for around 2,200 spectators, and several training pitches used by the different Barnsley squads. Until 2003, the stadium and the vast amount of land that surrounds it was owned by Barnsley themselves; however, after falling into administration in 2002 the council purchased the main Oakwell Stadium to allow the club to pay its creditors and remain participants in the Football League. The stadium's capacity is 23,287.
Rivalries.
According to a survey, 'The League of Love and Hate' conducted in August 2019, Barnsley supporters named fellow Yorkshire clubs <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> as their biggest rivals, with <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> and <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a> following.
Colours and strip.
Strip.
Home strip.
Barnsley have played their home games in red <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">shirts</a> for most of their history. The only exception to this is the period 1887–1901, where it is speculated that the team first wore blue shirts with claret arms, then circa 1890 the team wore chocolate and white stripes, before moving on to blue and white stripes around 1898. The team first wore red shirts in 1901. Since this time, the team have worn red shirts often with a white trim, although in more recent times a black trim has sometimes been used. As with most football clubs the shirt design varies from season to season. One particular design that stands out is the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1989–90</a> season shirt which featured white stars on a red background and has been named as one of the worst shirts ever. Manufacturers logos were added to the shirt in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77</a>, while sponsors were first added in the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20in%20English%20football">1980–81</a> season.
Away strip.
The club's <a href="Road%20%28sports%29">away</a> strip (used for away or cup fixtures where there is a clash of colours) differs from season to season but usually follows the design of the season's home strip with a variation on the colours. The most common colour for the away shirt has been white but many others have been used, including blue, yellow, black, <a href="ecru">ecru</a>, dark green and even black and blue stripes. One notable away strip was the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Barnsley%20F.C.%20season">2001–02</a> "It's just like watching <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a>" kit, where the team wore the colours of the five-time <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> winners <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> for their away games.

History.
Early years (1878–1950).
The club was founded as West Bromwich Strollers in 1878 by workers from <a href="Salter%20Housewares">George Salter's Spring Works</a> in West Bromwich, in the <a href="Black%20Country">Black Country</a>. They were renamed West Bromwich Albion in 1880, becoming the first team to adopt the "<a href="Albion">Albion</a>" suffix; Albion was a district of West Bromwich where some of the players lived or worked, close to what is today <a href="Greets%20Green">Greets Green</a>. The club joined the Birmingham & District Football Association in 1881 and became eligible for their first competition, the <a href="Birmingham%20Senior%20Cup">Birmingham Cup</a>. They reached the quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way. In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the <a href="Staffordshire%20Senior%20Cup">Staffordshire Cup</a>. Albion joined <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup for the first time in the 1883–84 season. In 1885 the club turned professional, and in <a href="1886%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1886</a> the team reached the FA Cup final for the first time, losing 2–0 to <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> in a replay. They reached the final again in <a href="1887%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1887</a>, but lost 2–0 to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. In <a href="1888%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1888</a> the team won the trophy for the first time, beating strong favourites <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> 2–1 in the final. As FA Cup winners, they qualified to play in a <a href="Football%20World%20Championship">Football World Championship</a> game against <a href="Scottish%20Cup">Scottish Cup</a> winners <a href="Renton%20F.C.">Renton</a>, which ended in a 4–1 defeat.
In March 1888, <a href="William%20McGregor%20%28football%29">William McGregor</a> wrote to what he considered to be the top five English teams, including Albion, informing them of his intention to form an association of clubs that would play each other home and away each season. Thus when the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> started later that year, Albion became one of the twelve founder members. Albion's second FA Cup success came in <a href="1892%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1892</a>, beating Aston Villa 3–0. They met Villa again in the <a href="1895%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1895</a> final, but lost 1–0. The team suffered relegation to Division Two in 1900–01, their first season at <a href="The%20Hawthorns">The Hawthorns</a>. They were promoted as champions the following season but relegated again in 1903–04. The club won the Division Two championship once more in 1910–11, and the following season reached another <a href="1912%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a>, where they were defeated by <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> in a replay.
Albion won the Football League title in <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Football%20League">1919–20</a> for the only time in their history following the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, their totals of 104 goals and 60 points both breaking the previous league records. The team finished as Division One runners-up in <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20Football%20League">1924–25</a>, narrowly losing out to <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, but were relegated in 1926–27. In 1930–31, they won promotion as well as the <a href="1931%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup</a>, beating <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham</a> 2–1 in the final. The "double" of winning the FA Cup and promotion has not been achieved before or since. Albion reached the final again in <a href="1935%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1935</a>, losing to <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, but were relegated three years later. They gained promotion in 1948–49, and there followed the club's longest unbroken spell in the top flight of English football, a total of 24 years.
Success and decline (1950–1992).
In 1953–54, Albion came close to being the first team in the 20th century to win the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">League and Cup double</a>. They succeeded in winning the <a href="1954%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup</a>, beating Preston North End 3–2, but injuries and a loss of form towards the end of the season meant that they finished as runners-up to fierce rivals <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> in the league. Nonetheless, Albion became known for their brand of fluent, attacking football, with the 1953–54 side being hailed as the "Team of the Century". One national newspaper went so far as to suggest that the team be chosen "en masse" to represent <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> at the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954 FIFA World Cup</a> finals. They remained one of the top English sides for the remainder of the decade, reaching the semi-final of the 1957 FA Cup and achieving three consecutive top five finishes in Division One between 1957–58 and 1959–60.
Although their league form was less impressive during the 1960s, the second half of the decade saw West Brom establish a reputation as a successful cup side. Albion entered the Football League Cup for the first time in 1965–66 and, under manager <a href="Jimmy%20Hagan">Jimmy Hagan</a>, won <a href="1966%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">the final</a> by defeating <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> 5–3 on aggregate. That was the last <a href="two-legged">two-legged</a> final and, the following year, Albion reached the <a href="1967%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">final</a> again, the first played at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. They lost 3–2 to Third Division <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> after being 2–0 up at half-time. Albion's cup form continued under Hagan's successor <a href="Alan%20Ashman">Alan Ashman</a>. He guided the club to their last major trophy to date, the <a href="1968%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1968 FA Cup</a>, when they beat <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> in <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a> thanks to a single goal from <a href="Jeff%20Astle">Jeff Astle</a>. Albion reached the FA Cup semi-final and <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%20Cup">European Cup Winners Cup</a> quarter-final in <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1969</a>, and were defeated 2–1 by <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in the <a href="1970%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1970 League Cup Final</a>. 
The club were less successful during the reign of <a href="Don%20Howe">Don Howe</a>, and were relegated to Division Two at the end of 1972–73, but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player-manager <a href="Johnny%20Giles">Johnny Giles</a>. Under <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a>, Albion reached the 1978 FA Cup semi-final but lost to <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. In May of that year, Albion became the first English professional team to play in China, going unbeaten on their five-game trip. In <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Football%20League">1978–79</a>, the team finished third in Division One, their highest placing for over 20 years, and also reached the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> quarter-final, where they were defeated by <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a>. The team around this time was notable for simultaneously fielding three black players: <a href="Cyrille%20Regis">Cyrille Regis</a>, <a href="Laurie%20Cunningham">Laurie Cunningham</a> and <a href="Brendon%20Batson">Brendon Batson</a>; and is considered to be an integral part of the acceptance of black footballers in the English leagues. In his second spell as manager, <a href="Ronnie%20Allen">Ronnie Allen</a> guided the team to both domestic cup semi-finals in 1981–82. The mid-1980s saw the start of Albion's longest and deepest decline. They were relegated in 1985–86 with the worst record in the club's history, beginning a period of 16 years outside the top flight. Five years later, the club were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for the first and only time.
Recent years (1992–present).
Albion had spent the majority of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a>. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered the <a href="playoffs">play-offs</a> for the first time. Albion's first appearance at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> for over 20 years – and their last at the original stadium – saw them beat <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a> 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>. Manager <a href="Osvaldo%20Ardiles">Ossie Ardiles</a> then joined <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.
The appointment of <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a> in March 2000 heralded an upturn in the club's fortunes. Megson guided Albion to Division One safety in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a>, and to the play-offs a year later. He went on to lead the club to promotion to the Premier League in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">2001–02</a>. After being relegated in their first Premier League season, they made an immediate return to the top flight in 2003–04. In <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Premier%20League">2004–05</a>, Megson's successor, former Albion midfielder <a href="Bryan%20Robson">Bryan Robson</a>, led the team to a last-day "Great Escape", when Albion became the first Premier League club to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table at Christmas, as well as bottom on the final day of the season. They failed to avoid the drop the following season, and Robson was replaced by <a href="Tony%20Mowbray">Tony Mowbray</a> in October 2006. The club competed in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship%20play-offs">Championship play-off</a> final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> on 28 May 2007, but lost 1–0 to <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>. The following season, Mowbray led the Baggies to Wembley again, this time in the semi-finals of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, where they lost 1–0 to <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>. One month later, Albion were promoted to the Premier League as winners of the Championship, but were relegated at the end of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Premier%20League">2008–09</a> campaign. Mowbray left the club and was replaced by <a href="Roberto%20Di%20Matteo">Roberto Di Matteo</a>, who led the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt, but was dismissed in February 2011 and replaced by <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a>.
Hodgson guided Albion to an 11th-place finish for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Premier%20League">2010–11</a> season. Then followed an eight-season continuous run in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. It included an 8th-place finish in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Premier%20League">2012–13</a> under <a href="Steve%20Clarke">Steve Clarke</a>, and 10th-place finishes under Roy Hodgson in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Premier%20League">2011–12</a> and <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a> in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League">2016–17</a>. On 5 August 2016, it was announced that long-term owner <a href="Jeremy%20Peace">Jeremy Peace</a> had sold the club to a Chinese investment group headed up by <a href="Guochuan%20Lai">Lai Guochuan</a>. By this time, the club had begun to fall into a state of torpor, and were relegated at the end of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Premier%20League">2017–18</a> season, ending their eight-year Premier League stay. Pulis and his replacement <a href="Alan%20Pardew">Alan Pardew</a> were both sacked during the season. Albion finished fourth in their first season back in the Championship under the management of <a href="Darren%20Moore">Darren Moore</a>, losing the Championship play-off semi-final against Aston Villa on penalties. <a href="Slaven%20Bili%C4%87">Slaven Bilić</a> took over as boss on 13 June 2019, and led Albion to automatic promotion back to the Premier League during the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20EFL%20Championship">2019–20</a> season. Back in the Premier League, Bilić was controversially sacked on 16 December 2020, with <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> named as his replacement the same day. After Albion were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Premier%20League">2020–21</a> season, Allardyce resigned from his position. The club endured disappointing results back in the Championship during the tenures of <a href="Val%C3%A9rien%20Isma%C3%ABl">Valérien Ismaël</a> and then <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a>, who left the club in the relegation places in the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.%20season">2022–23</a> season. Former <a href="Marcelo%20Bielsa">Marcelo Bielsa</a> understudy <a href="Carlos%20Corber%C3%A1n">Carlos Corberán</a> was named as successor on 25 October.
He steered Albion clear of the relegation zone and guided them to a 9th place finish at the end of the <a href="2022-23%20EFL%20Championship">season</a>.
On 15 February 2024, it was announced that Florida-based entrepreneur Shelin Patel had reached an agreement to acquire an 87.8% stake in the club. As part of the agreement, Patel would also be named as the chairman of the club.
Crest and colours.
Badge.
Albion's main club badge dates back to the late 1880s, when club secretary Tom Smith suggested that a <a href="Song%20thrush">throstle</a> (song thrush) sitting on a <a href="Goal%20post">crossbar</a> be adopted for the badge. The badge has been subject to various revisions since then. It has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a <a href="Common%20hawthorn">hawthorn</a> branch at some point after the club's move to <a href="the%20Hawthorns">the Hawthorns</a>. The throstle was chosen because the <a href="public%20house">public house</a> in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, "the Throstles". The hawthorn bush is also a favourite bush of throstles, which were regularly seen on the pre-stadium estate and local area. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.
In 1975, a version of the badge (on a <a href="roundel">roundel</a> rather than a shield) was granted by the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> to the Football League for licensing to the club. The badge was described in heraldic <a href="blazon">blazon</a> as, "On a roundel paly of thirteen argent and azure a <a href="mistle%20thrush">mistle thrush</a> perched on a <a href="raspberry">raspberry</a> branch leaved and fructed proper." This is the only known occasion on which the branch has been described as a raspberry branch rather than a hawthorn branch: <a href="Rodney%20Dennys">Rodney Dennys</a>, the <a href="officer%20of%20arms">officer of arms</a> responsible, may have been imperfectly briefed.
The badge was re-designed in 2006, incorporating the name of the club for the first time. The new design aimed to safeguard and consolidate the club's identity. Prior to this, the main club badge rarely coincided with that worn on the first team strip. No badge appeared on the kit for most of the club's history, although the <a href="Stafford%20knot">Stafford knot</a> featured on the team jerseys for part of the 1880s. The <a href="West%20Bromwich">West Bromwich</a> town <a href="coat%20of%20arms">arms</a> were worn on the players' shirts for the <a href="1931%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1931</a>, <a href="1935%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1935</a> and <a href="1954%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1954</a> FA Cup finals. The town's <a href="Latin">Latin</a> motto, ""<a href="Labor%20omnia%20vincit">Labor omnia vincit</a>"", translates as "labour conquers all things" or "work conquers all". The town arms were revived as the shirt badge from 1994 until 2000, with the throstle moved to the collar of the shirts.
Albion's first regular shirt badge appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue. Although it featured the throstle, it did not include the blue and white striped shield of the club badge. A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1970s, a more abstract version of the throstle was used on the club's shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered WBA logo was displayed, a common abbreviation of the club's name in print. Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the team's shirts.
Colours.
West Brom have played in navy blue and white striped shirts for the majority of their existence, usually with white shorts and white socks. The team is occasionally referred to as "the Stripes" by supporters. A number of different colours were trialled during the club's formative years however, including cardinal red and blue quarters in 1880–81, yellow and white quarters in 1881–82, chocolate and blue halves in 1881–82 and 1882–83, red and white hoops in 1882–83, chocolate and white in 1883–84 and cardinal red and blue halves in 1884–85. The blue and white stripes made their first appearance in the 1885–86 season, although at that time they were of a lighter shade of blue; the navy blue stripes did not appear until after the First World War. For the regional leagues played during the Second World War, Albion were forced to switch to all-blue shirts, as <a href="rationing">rationing</a> meant that striped material was considered a luxury.
Like all football clubs, Albion sport a secondary or "change" strip when playing away from home against a team whose colours clash with their own. As long ago as the 1890s, and throughout much of the club's early history, a change strip of white jerseys with black shorts was worn. The away shirt additionally featured a large 'V' during the First World War. In the <a href="1935%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1935 FA Cup Final</a>, however, when both of Albion and <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>'s kits clashed, a switch was made to plain navy blue shirts. An all-red strip was adopted at the end of the 1950s, but was dropped following defeat in the <a href="1967%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1967 League Cup Final</a>, to be replaced by the all-white design that was worn during the club's <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup run of 1967–68</a>. Since then the away strip has changed regularly, with yellow and green stripes the most common of a number of different designs used. In the 1990s and 2000s a third kit has occasionally been introduced.
Albion players – along with those of other <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> teams – first wore numbers on the back of their shirts in the abandoned season of 1939–40, and names on the back of their shirts from <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a>. Red numbers were added to the side of Albion players' shorts in 1969.
Kit sponsors.
BSR Housewares became the club's first shirt <a href="English%20football%20sponsorship">sponsor</a> during the 1981–82 season. The club's shirts have been sponsored for the majority of the time since then, although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993–94 season, after local solicitors Coucher & Shaw were closed down by the <a href="Law%20Society%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Law Society of England and Wales</a>. Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008–09 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Building%20Society">West Bromwich Building Society</a>. Today the club's principal sponsor is Ideal Boilers.
Since July 2018, West Brom's <a href="Kit%20%28football%29">kit</a> has been manufactured by <a href="Puma%20%28brand%29">Puma</a>. Previous manufacturers have included Scoreline, Influence, Pelada, <a href="Patrick%20%28sportswear%20company%29">Patrick</a>, <a href="Diadora">Diadora</a>, <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> and <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>.
Stadium.
The speed with which the club became established following its foundation is illustrated by the fact that it outgrew four successive grounds in its first seven years. The first was Cooper's Hill, where they played from 1878 to 1879. From 1879 to 1881, they appear to have alternated between Cooper's Hill and Dartmouth Park. During the 1881–82 season, they played at Bunn's Field, also known as the Birches. This had a capacity of between 1,500 and 2,000, and was Albion's first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time. From 1882 to 1885, as the popularity of football increased, Albion rented the Four Acres ground from the well-established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club. But they quickly outgrew this new home and soon needed to move again. From 1885 to 1900, Albion played at <a href="Stoney%20Lane">Stoney Lane</a>; their tenure of this ground was arguably the most successful period in the club's history, as they won the FA Cup twice and were runners-up three times.
By 1900, when the lease on Stoney Lane expired, the club needed a bigger ground yet again and so made its last move to date. All of Albion's previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up a site on the town's border with <a href="Handsworth%2C%20West%20Midlands">Handsworth</a> and <a href="Smethwick">Smethwick</a>. The new ground was named <a href="The%20Hawthorns">The Hawthorns</a>, after the <a href="Common%20hawthorn">hawthorn</a> bushes that covered the area and were cleared to make way for it. Albion drew 1–1 with <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> in the first match at the stadium, on 3 September 1900. The record attendance at the Hawthorns was on 6 March 1937, when 64,815 spectators saw Albion beat <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 3–1 in the FA Cup quarter-final. The Hawthorns became an all-seater stadium in the 1990s, in order to comply with the recommendations of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>. Its capacity today is 26,688, the four stands being known respectively as the Birmingham Road End, Smethwick End, East Stand and West Stand (Halfords Lane). At an altitude of 551 feet (168 m) above sea level, the Hawthorns is the highest of all the 92 Premier League and Football League grounds.
The Hawthorns is certificated under the highest <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> pitch surfaces which means it is ready to host almost any competition if required. The stadium's West Stand has the potential to be developed over the Halfords Lane at the back of the stand to allow for an upper tier, bringing the capacity of The Hawthorns to around 30,000.
West Bromwich Albion own retail outlets around The Hawthorns, including its Stadium Megastore and seasonally a club store in <a href="West%20Bromwich">West Bromwich</a> town centre. They also own the former Hawthorns Pub, a <a href="Grade%20II%20listed">Grade II listed</a> building behind the West Stand on the corner of Halfords Lane and the Birmingham Road. This has served as the official club fanzone with licensed bars, live music, fan favourites – such as mascots and children activities – as well as being shared with a high street food outlet. The pub competes with The Vine pub in Roebuck Lane, a popular destination for visiting and home football fans year-round.
Supporters.
Fan culture.
The official West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club was founded on 4 October 1951. In the years since then, over 30 branches have been established throughout the United Kingdom, and internationally in Jersey, Ireland, Spain, Malta, Croatia, USA, UAE, India, Thailand and Australia. There are also supporters groups for those with disabilities, for mental health support, <a href="Punjabis">Punjabi</a> supporters, supporters in the emergency services and armed forces, and <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> people.
Albion's "club anthem" is "The Lord's my Shepherd", a setting of <a href="Psalm%2023">Psalm 23</a>. The song originated following a rare Sunday game in the 1970s and has been sung at matches ever since. Supporters of the team celebrate goals by bouncing up and down and chanting "Boing Boing". This dates back to the 1992–93 season, when the team was promoted from the new <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. "<a href="The%20Liquidator%20%28instrumental%29">The Liquidator</a>" instrumental by the <a href="Harry%20J.%20Allstars">Harry J.

The <a href="reggae">reggae</a> song "West Bromwich Albion" by Ray King is another club anthem popularly played before matches. In recent years fans of the team have celebrated the end of each season by adopting a <a href="Costume%20party">fancy dress</a> theme for the final away match, including dressing as <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> in 2004 in honour of Player of the Season <a href="Thomas%20Gaards%C3%B8e">Thomas Gaardsøe</a>.
In 2002–03 Albion's fans were voted the best in the Premier League by their peers, while in the BBC's 2002 "national intelligence test" "Test the Nation", they were found to be "more likely to be smarter than any other football supporters, registering an average score of 138".

Publications.
The club has published an official matchday <a href="Football%20programme">programme</a> for supporters since 1905. The publication was entitled "Albion News" for many years, but was renamed "Albion" from the 2002–03 season until the close season of 2013, when it was renamed back to "Albion News". It won Premier League Programme of the Year in 2002–03 and Third Division Programme of the Year in 1991–92. In 2007–08, it was awarded Championship Programme of the Year by both Programme Monthly and the Football Programme Directory. The programme has a circulation in excess of 8,000 copies. The first West Bromwich Albion <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>, "Fingerpost", was published from 1983 until 1992, and was followed by several others, most notably "Grorty Dick" (1989–2005) and "Last Train to Rolfe Street" (1992–1995). Since "Grorty Dick" ceased publication in 2005, the club now only has one fanzine dedicated to it; 'Baggie Shorts' which is produced by the West Bromwich Albion Supporters' Club London Branch.
"Baggies" nickname.
Although known in their early days as "the Throstles", the club's more popular nickname among supporters came to be "the Baggies", a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s, but its exact origins are uncertain. One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, because of the large baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the <a href="Black%20Country">Black Country</a>. Club historian Tony Matthews, however, suggests that it derives from the "bagmen", who carried the club's matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line. Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club's early years. The official club mascots are named "Baggie Bird" and "Albi"; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest.
Rivalries.
Historically, Albion's greatest rivals were <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> from nearby <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>. The two clubs contested three <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a>s between 1887 and 1895 (Villa winning two and Albion one). More recently, however, some Albion fans tend to see <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> as their main rivals, particularly as between 1989 and 2002 Albion and Villa were never in the same division, but Albion were in the same division as Wolves for 11 out of 14 seasons. This had led to Aston Villa supporters now considering <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> to be their fiercest rivals. A less-heated rivalry also exists with Birmingham City, with whom Albion contested the 1931 FA Cup final, as well as a semi-final in 1968.
A number of <a href="hooligan%20firm">hooligan firm</a>s associate themselves with Albion, including <a href="Section%205%20%28hooligan%20firm%29">Section 5</a>, Clubhouse and the Smethwick Mob.
Black Country derby.
Albion and Wolves contest the <a href="Black%20Country%20derby">Black Country derby</a>, one of the longest standing derbies in world football. It is considered one of the fiercest rivalries in English football. A 2008 survey found it to be the most intense rivalry in the country, with one in four fans from both clubs claiming that their rivalry went much deeper than football. The two sides have played each other 160 times, with their first major clash being an FA Cup tie in 1886. Both Albion and Wolves were founding members of <a href="English%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> in <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League">1888</a>, making the derby the joint oldest in English league football. The rivalry came to prominence when the two clubs contested the league title in 1953–54, and during the 1990s it intensified to new heights among supporters, with both clubs languishing in Division One for much of the decade and only local pride at stake. Moreover, in 2002 Albion came from being 11 points adrift to overhaul Wolves to gain promotion. The rivalry was further heightened after the sides met in the play-offs in 2007. A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com confirmed that the majority of both Albion and Wolves supporters consider the other to be their main rival. In February 2012 the Baggies beat Wolves 5–1 away from home, with <a href="Peter%20Odemwingie">Peter Odemwingie</a> scoring a hat-trick. The game became known as the 'demolition derby', and remains the highest scoring Black Country derby of the 21st century. Despite their geographical location, fellow Black Country club <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> are seen as lesser rivals, having played in a lower division than Albion for most of their history.
West Bromwich Albion–Aston Villa rivalry.
Ranked by "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" in 2010 as the most fierce in the region, games between <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> and West Brom are particularly ferocious. The two first met on 9 December 1882, in the second round of the Staffordshire Cup: Villa hosted a 3–3 draw in front of 13,900 fans, while in the replay West Brom won by a single goal with an attendance of 10,500. On 3 January 1885, they met for the first time in the third round of the FA Cup: a goalless draw at West Brom was followed by a 3–0 victory for them away at Villa. The following year, both teams became founder members of the Football League. They met first in a league fixture on 19 January 1889, Villa winning 2–0 at home, before a draw the next week ending 3–3. The two teams met in two further FA Cup finals in the 19th century, a 3–0 win for West Brom in <a href="1892%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1892</a> and a 1–0 win for Aston Villa in <a href="1895%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1895</a>.
Birmingham City were relegated from the Premier League in 2011 and Wolverhampton Wanderers a season later, leaving Aston Villa and West Brom as the only West Midlands teams in England's top division. Without their respective main rivals and with Albion finishing above their nearest rivals for the second season in a row, the historic rivalry was rekindled to pre-1990s competitiveness. At the end of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Premier%20League">2015–16 season</a>, Aston Villa were relegated, leaving West Brom as the only West Midlands team in the top flight for the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League">2016–17 season</a>. After Albion's relegation at the end of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Premier%20League">2017–18 Premier League</a>, the teams faced each other in the Championship. In the <a href="2019%20English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">2018–19 EFL Championship play-off</a> semi-finals, Villa controversially knocked out Albion on penalties, after the Albion had two men sent-off over both legs.
Ownership and governance.
"As of 14 July 2023":
History of Albion's ownership and governance.
In the club's formative years, West Bromwich Albion were run by a seven-man playing committee, and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d (<a href="Sixpence%20%28British%20coin%29">six pence</a>) (2p). Albion's first chairman was <a href="Henry%20Jackson%20%28football%20manager%29">Henry Jackson</a>, appointed in 1885, with the club becoming a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a> in June 1891. Other early chairmen of Albion included <a href="Jem%20Bayliss">Jem Bayliss</a> and <a href="Billy%20Bassett">Billy Bassett</a>, both of whom had earlier played for the club. Indeed, from 1878 to 1986 there was always an Albion player or ex-player on the club's committee or board of directors. Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following the resignation of the previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon them by their bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities. Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players' summer wages from his own pocket. He remains Albion's longest-serving chairman, having held the position until his death in 1937. The club's longest-serving director was Major H. Wilson Keys, during the period 1930–1965, including 15 years as chairman. He became vice-president of the <a href="The%20Football%20Association">Football Association</a> in 1969.
Sir <a href="Bert%20Millichip">Bert Millichip</a> served as Albion chairman from 1974 to 1983, after which he chose to concentrate on his role as chairman of the Football Association. In 1996, the club became a <a href="public%20limited%20company">public limited company</a>, issuing shares to supporters at £500 and £3,000 each, under the Chairmanship of Paul Thompson. The shares were quoted on the <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">Alternative Investment Market</a>, but the club withdrew from the stock exchange in order to become a private company again in 2004. The name of the company thus reverted from West Bromwich Albion plc to West Bromwich Albion Limited, the latter becoming a subsidiary of West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited. <a href="Jeremy%20Peace">Jeremy Peace</a> took up the post in 2002, after a rift between previous chairman Paul Thompson and manager <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a> forced Thompson to quit the club.
In September 2007, Peace acquired additional shares in West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited, taking his total stake in the company to 50.56%. This triggered a requirement, under the <a href="Takeover">Takeover</a> Code, for him to make a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares in both WBA Holdings Ltd and WBA Ltd. Later that year, Michelle Davies became Albion's first female director. She stepped down in 2010. Jeremy Peace announced in June 2008 that he was looking for a major new investor for the club, but no firm proposals were received by the 31 July deadline.
On 24 July 2015, Jeremy Peace announced that his sale exclusivity deal was now off after a potential buyer was unable to fulfil the terms of sale.
In July 2016, Peace announced that he had found a buyer in the form of a Chinese investment group headed by <a href="Lai%20Guochuan">Lai Guochuan</a>. The figure agreed upon is believed to have been in the region of £175 million – £200 million. The takeover was successfully completed ahead of schedule on 15 September the same year. <a href="John%20Williams%20%28football%20executive%29">John Williams</a> was originally appointed chairman of the club before Lai replaced him with associate <a href="Li%20Piyue">Li Piyue</a> after the club's relegation in the 2017–18 season. Lai himself took over as chairman on 2 February 2022.
The <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.%20season">2022–23</a> season saw increased scrutiny of the club's ownership, and the practices of majority shareholder Guochuan Lai. The club's financial situation began to receive national media attention, having already been commented on frequently in local press. Supporter action groups and in-stadium protests by fans to raise awareness of the club's off-field issues took shape during the season, but were briefly paused in April 2023 as the club's fans supported the side's promotion push.
In February 2024, the English Football League approved a takeover of the club by American businessman Shilen Patel.

"As of 18 July 2023"
Notable former players.
As part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations in 2004, a survey was commissioned via the official West Bromwich Albion website and the "<a href="Express%20%26amp%3B%20Star">Express & Star</a>" newspaper to determine the greatest West Brom players of all time. A modern-day, 16-man squad was compiled from the results; all selected players are depicted on a commemorative mural displayed at <a href="The%20Hawthorns">The Hawthorns</a>.

History.
Early years and entry to the Football League (1878–1954).
The club was founded as an amateur side in 1878 and were known as Ipswich A.F.C. until 1888 when they merged with Ipswich Rugby Club to form Ipswich Town Football Club. The team won a number of local cup competitions, including the Suffolk Challenge Cup and the <a href="Suffolk%20Senior%20Cup">Suffolk Senior Cup</a>. After playing in the <a href="Norfolk%20%26amp%3B%20Suffolk%20League">Norfolk & Suffolk League</a> from 1899 and the <a href="East%20Anglian%20League">South East Anglian League</a> between 1903 and 1906, they joined the <a href="Southern%20Amateur%20Football%20League">Southern Amateur League</a> in 1907 and, with results improving steadily, became champions in the <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20in%20English%20football">1921–22</a> season. The club won the league a further three times, in <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20in%20English%20football">1929–30</a>, <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20in%20English%20football">1932–33</a> and <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34</a>, before becoming founder members of the <a href="Eastern%20Counties%20Football%20League">Eastern Counties Football League</a> at the end of the <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20in%20English%20football">1934–35</a> season. A year later, the club turned professional and joined the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>, which they won in its first season and finished third in the next.
Ipswich were elected to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> on 30 May 1938, and played in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> until the end of the <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20in%20English%20football">1953–54</a> season, when they won the title and <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>.
Promotion and First Division success (1954–1963).
The club were immediately relegated back to the Third Division South the following year at the end of a poor season, but made better progress after <a href="Scott%20Duncan%20%28footballer%29">Scott Duncan</a> was replaced as team manager by <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> in August 1955. The club won the Third Division South title again in <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57</a>, and returned to the higher division. This time, Ipswich established themselves in the Second Division, and as the division champions, won promotion to the top level of English football, the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a>.
In the top flight for the first time, Ipswich became champions of the Football League at the first attempt in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20in%20English%20football">1961–62</a>. As English league champions, they qualified for the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20European%20Cup">1962–63 European Cup</a>, defeating Maltese side <a href="Floriana%20F.C.">Floriana</a> 14–1 on aggregate before losing to <a href="A.C.%20Milan">AC Milan</a>. Ramsey left the club in April 1963 to take charge of the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a>. Under his leadership the England team won the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a>. He received a <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a> for "services to football" in 1967.
Decline and revival after Ramsey (1963–1969).
Ramsey was replaced by <a href="Jackie%20Milburn">Jackie Milburn</a>, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch plummeted. Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich slipped down to the Second Division in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20in%20English%20football">1964</a>, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games – one of the worst-ever defensive records in English senior football. Milburn quit after just one full season and was replaced by <a href="Bill%20McGarry%20%28footballer%29">Bill McGarry</a> in 1964. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion along with his assistant <a href="Sammy%20Chung">Sammy Chung</a> in the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20in%20English%20football">1967–68</a> season, winning the division by a single point ahead of <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>. McGarry left to manage <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a> and was replaced by <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a> in January 1969.
The Bobby Robson era (1969–1982).
Robson led Ipswich to two major trophies and several seasons in top flight European football. The successful period began in 1973 when the club won the <a href="Texaco%20Cup">Texaco Cup</a> and finished fourth in the league, qualifying for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> for the first time. In the 1974–75 season they reached the semi-finals of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time, losing to West Ham United after a replay, and finished third in the league. By the late 1970s, Robson had built a strong side with talent in every department, introducing the Dutch pair <a href="Arnold%20M%C3%BChren">Arnold Mühren</a> and <a href="Frans%20Thijssen">Frans Thijssen</a> to add flair to a team that featured British internationals including <a href="John%20Wark">John Wark</a>, <a href="Terry%20Butcher">Terry Butcher</a> and <a href="Paul%20Mariner">Paul Mariner</a>, although the Ipswich squad perhaps lacked the depth of established big clubs like <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Ipswich regularly featured in the top five of the league and in the UEFA Cup. At their peak in the <a href="1979-80%20in%20English%20football">1979–80 season</a>, they beat <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> 6–0 in a league game at Portman Road, a game where United goalkeeper <a href="Gary%20Bailey">Gary Bailey</a> also saved three penalties. The defeat cost United two points – the margin which eventually separated them and champions Liverpool. Major success came in <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final%201978">1978</a> when Ipswich beat <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> to win their only <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> trophy. The triumph was followed by almost winning the triple in 1980-81. Ipswich led the top division for most of the season and were on course to win a second league title plus FA Cup and European honours. However, injuries and fixture congestion (a squad of thirteen players played over sixty matches) took its toll and Ipswich ultimately came runners up to Aston Villa (a side they had beaten home and away in the league and in the FA Cup) and were semi-finalists in the FA Cup. Ipswich did win the UEFA Cup, however, in 1981 with a 5–4 victory over AZ Alkmaar in the two-legged final. The run to the final included a 4–1 win at <a href="AS%20Saint-%C3%89tienne">St Etienne</a>, captained by <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a>. The club also finished as league runners-up in 1981 and 1982.
Robson's success with Ipswich attracted the attention of many bigger clubs, and he was linked with the <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> job when <a href="Dave%20Sexton">Dave Sexton</a> was sacked in May 1981, but the job went to <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a> instead. <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> lured Robson away from Portman Road a year later, when he accepted their offer to manage the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a> in July 1982.
Relegation after Robson and promotion under Lyall (1982–1994).
Robson's successor at Ipswich was his assistant manager <a href="Bobby%20Ferguson%20%28footballer%20born%201938%29">Bobby Ferguson</a>. Under Ferguson, Town finished mid-table twice, but worsening performances meant that they began to struggle in the top division. The recent construction of an expensive new stand at Portman Road limited the club's budget, despite the money gaining from sales of key players including Thijssen and Wark.
Ipswich were finally relegated to the Second Division at the end of the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1985–86 season</a>. Butcher, the last remaining key player from the successful 1981 team, was sold to <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> that summer. Ferguson, who had remained in charge despite the relegation, left the club in May 1987 after his contract expired, following Ipswich's failure to return to the First Division. Ipswich Town were then managed by <a href="John%20Duncan%20%28footballer%29">John Duncan</a> for three years until he was replaced by former <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> boss <a href="John%20Lyall">John Lyall</a> in May 1990, with Ipswich still in the Second Division. Lyall guided Ipswich to the Second Division title and promotion to the new <a href="Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a>, ready for the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a> season. Suffering only two league defeats before the New Year, Ipswich started the season well and were fourth in the Premier League in January 1993, but a dip in form during the final weeks of the season saw them finish 16th. Poor form continued into the following season and Ipswich only avoided relegation that year when <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> suffered a 3–2 defeat at <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> on the final day of the season. Six months later, fortunes on the pitch had not improved, and Lyall was sacked in December 1994 with the club bottom of the Premiership.
Relegation and revival under George Burley (1994–2002).
Lyall's successor, <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a>, was unable to turn team performances around, and Ipswich were dealt a Premiership record defeat, 9–0, at <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, on their way to relegation. Back in the second tier of the league, Burley led the club to three consecutive promotion playoffs, but they were to endure defeats in all three semi-finals. Ipswich finally returned to the Premiership in 2000 after coming from behind to beat <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> 4–2 in the last <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> playoff final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. Ipswich performed well in the Premiership in their first season with Burley's side finishing in an impressive fifth place—being pipped by <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> on the last day of the season for a place in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>. Consolation was a UEFA Cup place and <a href="Premier%20League%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year">FA Premier League Manager of the Year</a> Award for Burley.
However, the team took only one win in their opening seventeen league games the following season leaving them bottom in December. Despite a good run of form in January and February, Burley could not save the club from relegation back to the Championship at the end of the season. The loss of income due to relegation also led to the club going into <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">financial administration</a>. There was the minor consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, this time via the <a href="UEFA%20Fair%20Play%20ranking">UEFA Fair Play ranking</a>, and Ipswich survived two ties before losing in the second round proper to Czech side <a href="FC%20Slovan%20Liberec">Slovan Liberec</a>. A slow start to the season, culminating in a 0–3 defeat at struggling <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a>, meant that Burley was sacked in October 2002 after nearly eight years as manager.
Years in the Championship (2002–2019).
First team coach <a href="Tony%20Mowbray">Tony Mowbray</a> was given four matches as caretaker manager, winning once, but he was ultimately replaced as manager by the former <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a>, <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> manager <a href="Joe%20Royle">Joe Royle</a>, who had played for local rival Norwich City. Royle inherited a side struggling near the Division One relegation zone, but revived fortunes such that the team narrowly failed to reach the playoffs. The <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> season saw the club come out of administration and continue to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League. They finished that season in fifth, but were defeated in the playoff semi-finals by <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>.
Narrowly missing automatic promotion in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">2004–05</a>, Royle again took Ipswich to the play-offs, but once more they lost to West Ham United in the semi-finals. <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06</a> saw Ipswich finish in 15th place—the club's lowest finish since 1966. Joe Royle resigned by mutual consent on 11 May 2006, and a month later, <a href="Jim%20Magilton">Jim Magilton</a> was officially announced as the new manager. In November 2007, the club were involved in takeover discussions with both businessman <a href="Marcus%20Evans">Marcus Evans</a> and former <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> director <a href="David%20Sullivan%20%28publisher%29">David Sullivan</a>. In December 2007, Evans completed his takeover of the club, purchasing an 87.5% stake in the club, investing around £44 million, which included the purchase of the club's existing £32 million debt. The club agreed a sponsorship deal with the Marcus Evans Group on 20 May 2008, lasting until 2018, the longest in the club's history.
After failing to reach the playoffs despite substantial investment, Magilton was sacked in April 2009, and new Chief Executive <a href="Simon%20Clegg">Simon Clegg</a> replaced him with former Manchester United player, <a href="Roy%20Keane">Roy Keane</a>. Keane's spell as manager came to an end after an unsuccessful 18 months, when he was sacked in January 2011, to be replaced briefly by <a href="Ian%20McParland">Ian McParland</a> in a caretaker role before <a href="Paul%20Jewell">Paul Jewell</a> took the reins on a permanent basis. A poor start to the 2012/13 season with Ipswich bottom of the Championship after winning only one of their first twelve games, led to Jewell leaving his position on 24 October 2012 by mutual consent.
He was replaced temporarily by <a href="Chris%20Hutchings">Chris Hutchings</a> for a single match in a caretaker role, before former Wolves boss <a href="Mick%20McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> was appointed full-time on 1 November 2012. McCarthy led Ipswich to avoid relegation, taking them from bottom of the league in November to finish in 14th position. The <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season%202013-14">following season</a> produced a 9th-place finish and in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a> a 6th place and play-off finish – though the club lost in the semi-finals to local rivals Norwich City 4–2 on aggregate. Ipswich ended the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2016–17 season</a> in 16th place, their lowest finish since the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Football%20League">1958–59 season</a>. McCarthy announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the 2017–18 season on 23 March 2018, though he ultimately left the role early with four games to go. He was replaced until the end of the season by <a href="Bryan%20Klug">Bryan Klug</a> as a caretaker manager and Ipswich finished the season in 12th.
On 30 May 2018, <a href="Paul%20Hurst">Paul Hurst</a> was announced as the new manager of the club on a three-year contract. However, after a poor start to the season and with the team bottom of the table, Hurst was sacked in October 2018 after less than five months in charge – making him the shortest serving manager in the club's history. He was replaced by former Norwich City manager <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a>, but he was unable to prevent relegation to League One at the end of the 2018–19 season, ending Ipswich's 63-year stay in the top two tiers of English football.
League One and return to the Championship (2019–present).
Lambert remained as manager following relegation to take charge of Ipswich's first season in the third tier since 1957. Ipswich finished the season in 11th place, the club's lowest finish since 1953. The standings were decided by points-per-game due to the season's suspension in March 2020 as a result of the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. After failing to mount a promotion challenge during the following season, Lambert left the club by mutual consent on 28 February 2021. Former Wigan boss <a href="Paul%20Cook%20%28footballer%29">Paul Cook</a> was appointed as his replacement three days later.
On 7 April 2021, the club announced that US investment group Gamechanger 20 Limited had purchased a majority stake in the club. The consortium was made up of Ohio-based investment group ORG, the "Three Lions Fund" (made up of three <a href="Phoenix%20Rising%20FC">Phoenix Rising FC</a> board members) and former owner Marcus Evans, who remained as a minority shareholder. Ipswich finished the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2020–21 season</a> in 9th place, three positions outside the <a href="2021%20English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-offs</a>. Expectations were high ahead of the following season, but following a series of disappointing results, Cook was sacked in December 2021. On 16 December 2021, <a href="Kieran%20McKenna">Kieran McKenna</a>, first-team coach at Manchester United, was appointed to replace Cook. Ipswich finished the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2021–22 season</a> in 11th place.
With McKenna's first full season in charge, the following season proved more successful. Following an undefeated streak of 18 league games, and breaking several club records, on 29 April 2023, Ipswich were promoted back to the Championship after defeating <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> 6–0. Ipswich finished the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a> in second place, with 98 points and scoring 101 league goals.
Crest and colours.
Crest.
Ipswich Town's shirts did not sport a crest until the mid-1960s, when they adopted a design based on the Ipswich coat of arms, featuring a gold <a href="Lion%20%28heraldry%29">lion rampant guardant</a> on a red background on the left half and three gold ramparts on a blue background on the right half. In 1972, the crest was redesigned as the result of a competition, won by the Treasurer of the Supporters Club, John Gammage. Each element of the new design was intended to represent the region.
 This crest was re-used on the home and goalkeeper kit during the 2020/21 season, in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Ipswich's UEFA Cup triumph. The crest was modified in 1995 after consultation with a Supporters Forum, with the turrets of the Wolsey Gate moved to the top of the crest, the yellow background changed to red, the Suffolk Punch given a more dominant physique and the F.C. expanded to "Football Club". Three stars were added to the sleeve of the team's away shirt for the 2004–05 season, and also to the home kit for the 2005–06 season. These stars were added to represent the three major <a href="%23Honours">trophies which Ipswich Town have won</a>; the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> and the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">old First Division</a>. The stars were relocated directly above the crest when the shirt was redesigned prior to the 2007–08 season, with them being moved again in 2022–23 to the back of the shirt.
Colours.
Ipswich Town's traditional home colours are blue shirts with white shorts and blue socks. One of Ipswich Town's nicknames is "The Blues", stemming from their traditional kit. The club's first registered colours were blue and white striped shirts with black shorts. All-blue shirts and white shorts were first worn in the 1936–37 season, following the clubs entry into the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern Football League</a> after turning professional. These have stood as the primary colours of the club's home kits ever since.
Since turning professional, Ipswich have used a number of away colours, including white, orange, red and black vertical stripes, claret and green, cream and black vertical stripes and dark blue and claret. In 2006, the club donated 500 orange and blue-and-white shirts to children in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>.
Kit suppliers and sponsors.
In 1981, Ipswich Town announced a sponsorship deal with Japanese-based electronics company <a href="Pioneer%20Corporation">Pioneer Corporation</a>, who became the first official sponsors of the club. Pioneer Corporation also sponsored the west stand of the club's Portman Road stadium up until 1999, formerly known as the West Stand. Pioneer would continue to sponsor the club's kits until 1985, when a new sponsorship deal was agreed with local Suffolk radio station <a href="Radio%20Orwell">Radio Orwell</a>. The radio station would only sponsor the club's kits for a single season before being replaced with pharmaceutical and horticultural chemical manufacturers <a href="Fisons">Fisons</a>. Fisons were the main sponsors of the club from the 1986–87 season through to the 1994–95 season, including the 1991–92 season when the club won the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> championship and gained promotion to the inaugural season of the newly founded <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. Since then Ipswich have had multiple kit sponsors, including Suffolk-based brewing company <a href="Greene%20King">Greene King</a> from 1995 to 2001, and the energy companies <a href="TXU%20Energi">TXU Energi</a> (2001–2003), <a href="Powergen">Powergen</a> (2003–2006) and <a href="E.ON">E.ON</a> (2006–2008). After the club's takeover by <a href="Marcus%20Evans">Marcus Evans</a> in 2007, Marcus Evans Group became the club's new primary sponsor and would go on to be the football club's main sponsor from 2008 until 2018. In January 2018, the club agreed a new three year sponsorship deal worth almost £2 million with British <a href="online%20casino">online casino</a> company Magical Vegas. In May 2020, Magical Vegas revealed that they had donated the final year of their shirt sponsor rights to <a href="Carers%20Trust">The Carers Trust</a> charity for the 2020–21 season. On 6 May 2021, the club announced that popular artist and longtime Ipswich fan <a href="Ed%20Sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> would be the club's new shirt sponsor for the 2021–22 season, a deal which was later extended to cover until the end of the 2023–24 season. On 14 June 2022, Ipswich announced that the club had signed a 4-year contract with Umbro to become the new kit manufacturers for both the Men’s and Women’s teams, marking the first time since 1995 that Ipswich's kits were made by Umbro.
Stadium.
Between 1878 and 1884, Ipswich Town played at two grounds in the town, <a href="Broomhill%20Park">Broomhill</a> and Brook's Hall, but in 1884, the club moved to <a href="Portman%20Road">Portman Road</a> and have played there ever since. At their new home, Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets, in 1890, but the more substantial elements of ground development did not begin until, in 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground.
The first stand, a wooden structure, was built on the Portman Road side of the pitch in 1905. In 1911 the roof was blown off, and the ground was later commandeered by the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> for the duration of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The club turned professional in 1936, and work began on the first bank of <a href="Terrace%20%28stadium%29">terracing</a> at the north end of the pitch. The following year, on the back of winning the Southern League, a similar terrace was built at the southern ’Churchmans’ end. All sides were terraced by 1954, and <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">floodlight</a>s were erected in 1959 for use in lower light conditions. The two-tier Portman Stand was built along the east side of the ground in place of the existing terraces in 1971, and the West Stand was extended in 1982 by the addition of a third tier. The rebuilt West Stand was renamed the Pioneer Stand as a result of the club's sponsorship by the electronics company <a href="Pioneer%20Corporation">Pioneer Corporation</a> and was converted to all-seating in 1990. In 1992, following the recommendations of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> in the wake of the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> three years earlier, the terraces in both the north and south stands were also converted to all-seating, creating the first complete all-seater stadium in the top flight of English football with a spectator capacity of 22,600.
Success that took place on the pitch led to further investment in the infrastructure, with the club spending over £22 million on redeveloping both North and South stands, resulting in a current capacity of 30,311, making it the largest-capacity football stadium in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>. In the past ten years, statues of both Sir Alf Ramsey and Sir Bobby Robson have been unveiled outside the stadium. The North Stand was renamed in honour of former manager <a href="Sir%20Bobby%20Robson">Sir Bobby Robson</a> in September 2009. On 31 March 2012, in conjunction with celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Ipswich Town winning the First Division, the South Stand was renamed in honour of Ipswich and England's former manager <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a>. Portman Road now features two stands named after their two most successful managers in the club's history, as well as being England's two most successful managers. On 10 July 2012, the West Stand, formerly known as the "Pioneer Stand" and the "Britannia Stand", was renamed the "East of England Co-operative Stand" following a sponsorship deal with the <a href="East%20of%20England%20Co-operative%20Society">East of England Co-operative Society</a>. The Co-op's sponsorship lasted until 2021, when it was not renewed and returned to be simply the West Stand. The East Stand of Portman Road, formerly known as the "Portman Stand", is called the "<a href="Cobbold%20family">Cobbold</a> Stand", named after the former owners of the club. The playing surface at Portman Road is highly regarded and has been voted best pitch in the league on a number of occasions. The former groundsman, Alan Ferguson, received a number of accolades, including both Premiership and Championship Groundsman of the Year. The stadium has also hosted many England youth international matches, and one senior <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> <a href="Exhibition%20game%23Association%20football">friendly</a> international match, against <a href="Croatia%20national%20football%20team">Croatia</a> in 2003.
Supporters.
A recent nickname for Town is "The Tractor Boys", which was coined during the club's brief period in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> from <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a> to <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">2001–02</a>, when the team regularly competed against more fashionable clubs. The nickname is an example of <a href="Self-deprecation">self-deprecating humour</a> referring to Suffolk's agricultural heritage. The origins of the nickname are not certain, but the first generally accepted use of the nickname was created whilst playing at Leeds United in 2000–2001: Ipswich were winning the game 2–1 and the Leeds fans started chanting, "We're being beaten by a bunch of tractor drivers". Barracking by supporters of more established Premiership clubs during Town's spell in the Premiership lent the ironic chant "1–0 to the Tractor Boys" increased potency and publicity, and the nickname is commonly used by the media. Former Town manager Jim Magilton commented in the local press that he disliked the nickname and said that it conjured up "images of carrot-crunching yokels", while players such as <a href="Matt%20Holland">Matt Holland</a> accepted the chant with good humour.
Ipswich have a global fan base, with the official Ipswich Town Supporters Club having supporters branches across the world. The club has a particularly strong affiliation with German club <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>, with Fortuna fans making an annual visit to <a href="Portman%20Road%20Stadium">Portman Road</a> since 2006. Ipswich fans also organise visits to the <a href="Merkur%20Spiel-Arena">Merkur Spiel-Arena</a> in Düsseldorf to support Fortuna at their home matches. The two clubs have previously organised a pre-season <a href="Exhibition%20game%23Association%20football">friendly</a> match in Düsseldorf in 2015, which was the first match to be played between the two teams.
Rivalries.
The club's main rivals are <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>. When the two teams meet it is known as the <a href="East%20Anglian%20derby">East Anglian derby</a>, or, informally, as the "Old Farm derby", a comic reference to the "<a href="Old%20Firm">Old Firm</a> Derby" played between Scottish teams <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> and <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> and the <a href="Agriculture%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">prominence of agriculture in East Anglia</a>. The series began in the early 20th century, when both clubs were amateur organisations. The first derby was held between the two clubs on 15 November 1902, with the first derby between the two professional clubs taking place in 1939. Locally, much is made of the informal title "<a href="Pride%20of%20Anglia">Pride of Anglia</a>". Fans claim the title for either winning the East Anglian Derby, finishing highest in the league, having the better current league position and having the more successful club history.
Records and statistics.
<a href="Mick%20Mills">Mick Mills</a> holds the record for Ipswich league appearances, having played 741 first-team matches between 1966 and 1982. The club's top league goalscorer is <a href="Ray%20Crawford%20%28footballer%29">Ray Crawford</a>, who scored 203 goals between 1958 and 1969, while <a href="Ted%20Phillips%20%28footballer%29">Ted Phillips</a> holds the record for the most league goals scored in a season, 41 in the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57</a> season in <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a>. <a href="Allan%20Hunter%20%28footballer%29">Allan Hunter</a> won the most international caps whilst a player at the club, making 47 appearances for <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland</a> during his time at Ipswich.
The club's widest victory margins in the league have been their 7–0 wins against <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in 1964, against <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1974 and against <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in the First Division in 1976. Their heaviest defeats in the league were 10–1 against <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in 1963 and 9–0 against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in 1995.
Ipswich's record home attendance is 38,010 for a sixth round <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> match against <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a> on 8 March 1975. With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future.
The highest transfer fee received for an Ipswich player is £8.1 million as part of a deal worth in excess of £12 million from <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> for <a href="Connor%20Wickham">Connor Wickham</a> in June 2011, while the most spent by the club on a player was £4.75 million for <a href="Matteo%20Sereni">Matteo Sereni</a> from <a href="U.C.%20Sampdoria">Sampdoria</a> in July 2001, following the club's qualification for the UEFA Cup.
<a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a> is the club's longest serving manager in terms of games managed, managing Ipswich for 709 matches between 1969 and 1982. <a href="Scott%20Duncan%20%28footballer%29">Scott Duncan</a> is the club's longest serving manager in terms of time spent as manager at the club, managing the club for 6,487 days between 1937 and 1955.
Ipswich still maintain an <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20in%20European%20football">undefeated home record in European competition</a>. This record began in 1962, when the club first qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>. For 45 years, Ipswich held the record for the longest unbeaten run of games at home in European competition, with a run of 31 home matches undefeated. Due to the team's absence from such tournaments in recent years this record has since been broken by Dutch club <a href="AZ%20%28football%20club%29">AZ Alkmaar</a>, but remains a record for British clubs.

Wigan Athletic F.C.

 Wigan Athletic Football Club () is an English professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Wigan">Wigan</a>, <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England. The team competes in the <a href="EFL%20League%20One">EFL League One</a>, the third level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>.
Founded in 1932, they have played at the 25,138-seat <a href="DW%20Stadium">DW Stadium</a> since 1999, before which they played at <a href="Springfield%20Park%20%28Wigan%29">Springfield Park</a>. Their colours are blue and white stripes, although all-blue shirts have been common throughout the club's history. The club regards <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers">Bolton Wanderers</a> as its primary derby rival. Wigan competed in the <a href="Cheshire%20County%20League">Cheshire County League</a> for the first nine seasons of the club's existence, winning three league titles before being placed in the <a href="Lancashire%20Combination">Lancashire Combination</a> in 1947. It spent 14 years in the Lancashire Combination and secured four league titles during this time. It spent 1961 to 1968 back in the Cheshire County League, picking up another league title in 1964–65. Invited to become a founder member of the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> in 1968, the club won two league titles and also reached the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a> final in <a href="1973%20FA%20Trophy%20final">1973</a>. Wigan was elected to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1978 and was promoted out of the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> in 1981–82. The club won the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Associate Members' Cup</a> in <a href="1985%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup%20final">1985</a>, but was relegated back into the fourth tier in 1993. It won the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> title in 1996–97, the Football League Trophy in <a href="1999%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20final">1999</a> and the Second Division in 2002–03, before securing promotion out of the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> in 2004–05.
Wigan was the beaten finalist in the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> in <a href="2006%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2006</a> and won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in 2013, beating <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in the <a href="2013%20FA%20Cup%20final">final</a>. However, the club was relegated later that year, bringing its eight-season stay in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> to an end. The FA Cup success did, though, gain it a place in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> group stages the following season. Relegated from the Championship in 2015, the club won the League One title in 2015–16 and repeated this feat in 2017–18 after another relegation. On 1 July 2020, less than a month after a change of ownership, it was placed into <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> and was relegated from the Championship due to the subsequent points deduction. After narrowly avoiding relegation to League Two in 2020–21 under new ownership, Wigan won the League One title for a fourth time in 2021–22, but a year later were again relegated from the Championship following two further points deductions. Additional deductions of points were made in May 2023, meaning the club would start the 2023–24 League One season with minus eight points.
History.
Non-League football: 1932–1978.
Wigan Athletic was formed in 1932, following the winding-up of <a href="Wigan%20Borough%20F.C.">Wigan Borough</a> the year before. The establishment of Wigan Athletic was the sixth attempt to create a stable football club in the town following the demise of Wigan A.F.C., <a href="Wigan%20County%20F.C.">Wigan County</a>, <a href="Wigan%20United%20A.F.C.">Wigan United</a>, <a href="Wigan%20Town%20A.F.C.">Wigan Town</a> and Wigan Borough. The town's die-hard football enthusiasts planned the rebirth of a town team, and a public meeting was held at the Queen's Hall presided over by the then Mayor of Wigan, Councillor W.A. Hipwood, and Callum Roper, who called on the town to keep up its reputation for producing fine sportsmen by keeping intact an Association Football team as well as the Rugby League team. A committee was elected and a new club was formed, Wigan Athletic. <a href="Springfield%20Park%20%28Wigan%29">Springfield Park</a>, the former home of Wigan Borough, was purchased by the club for £2,850 from the owners of the Woodhouse Lane dog track. Despite their initial application being turned down, Wigan Athletic were elected into the <a href="Cheshire%20County%20League">Cheshire County League</a> following the resignation of <a href="Manchester%20Central%20F.C.">Manchester Central</a>. The club had also made the first of many attempts to be admitted into the <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a>, but failed to receive a single vote. On 27 August 1932, Wigan Athletic played their first-ever league game against <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale Reserves</a>. The team played in red and white shirts with black shorts.
Wigan Athletic won its first honours in the 1933–34 season, finishing top of the Cheshire League, despite being based in neighbouring <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. In the following season the club won a second league championship and also entered the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time, defeating <a href="Carlisle%20United%20F.C.">Carlisle United</a> 6–1 in the first round – a cup record for the biggest victory by a non-League club over a League club. In the 1935–36 season, the club won its third consecutive Cheshire League title and the <a href="Lancashire%20FA%20Challenge%20Trophy">Lancashire Junior Cup</a>.
After the Second World War, Wigan Athletic adopted their present-day blue and white colours. The club struggled to assemble a competitive side and finished bottom of the league in 1946–47 season. Despite their pre-war success, the club failed to gain re-election and was replaced by <a href="Winsford%20United%20F.C.">Winsford United</a>. The club joined the <a href="Lancashire%20Combination">Lancashire Combination</a>, winning the league in their first season. In 1950, Wigan Athletic came close to election to <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, narrowly losing out to <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a> and <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town">Shrewsbury Town</a>. The club would frequently apply for election to the Football League over the next 28 years before finally being accepted.
In the 1953–54 season, Wigan played an FA Cup match against <a href="Hereford%20United%20F.C.">Hereford United</a> in front of a crowd of 27,526 – a club record and also a record attendance for a match between two non-League teams at a non-League ground. In the next round of the cup, Wigan Athletic was drawn against <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> side <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. Wigan Athletic held their top-flight opponents to a 2–2 draw at <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a>, but went on to lose the replay 3–2. In 1961, the club moved back to the Cheshire League.
In the 1964–65 season, Wigan Athletic won its first Cheshire League title since returning to the league, with top goalscorer Harry Lyon scoring 66 times. He remains the club's greatest goalscorer of all time. Wigan Athletic won four cup titles in the 1966–67 season (Lancashire Floodlit Cup winner, Liverpool Non League Senior Cup winner, Northern Floodlit League winner, Northern Floodlit League Cup winner) and was also Cheshire County League runner-up.
In 1968, Wigan Athletic was a founder member of the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a>. In winning the league title in 1970–71, the leading goalscorer, with 42 goals including seven hat-tricks, was <a href="Geoff%20Davies%20%28footballer%29">Geoff Davies</a>, who scored 28 goals in the following 1971–72 season. The team played at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> for the first time in the <a href="1973%20FA%20Trophy%20final">1973 FA Trophy final</a>, where they lost 2–1 to <a href="Scarborough%20F.C.">Scarborough</a>. After 34 failed election attempts, including one controversial but headline-making application in 1972 to join the <a href="Scottish%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Scottish League Second Division</a>, Wigan Athletic was elected to the Football League in 1978.
Early League years: 1978–1995.
Wigan Athletic finished in second place in the <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> in the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Northern%20Premier%20League">1977–78 season</a>, behind winners <a href="Boston%20United%20F.C.">Boston United</a>. But as Boston's ground and facilities did not meet <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> criteria for a League club, whereas <a href="Springfield%20Park%20%28Wigan%29">Springfield Park</a> did, Wigan Athletic were put forward for <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">election</a> to the league. There was no automatic promotion to the Football League until 1987, and at that time a club had to be 'voted out' of the League to allow a non-League team to be promoted in their place. At the end of the 1977–78 season, <a href="Southport%20F.C.">Southport</a> finished next to the bottom of the <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Four">old Fourth Division</a>, and faced near neighbours Wigan Athletic for their place in the league. The first round of voting was tied, with both clubs receiving 26 votes. After a tense re-vote which Wigan won 29–20, Southport lost their place in the Fourth Division and Wigan Athletic became an English League club on 2 June 1978.
In the club's first season of league football, Wigan Athletic finished in sixth place, just six points off promotion and playing in front of an average crowd of 6,701. Two more top-half finishes came in the following seasons, though a relatively weak 1980–81 season saw the dismissal of long-serving manager <a href="Ian%20McNeill">Ian McNeill</a> shortly before the end of the season. They gained their first Football League promotion under the management of former <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> player <a href="Larry%20Lloyd">Larry Lloyd</a> in 1981–82, when a points tally of 91 saw them join the former Division Three for the first time, beginning a 10-year spell in English football's third tier. The club struggled in their first season in Division Three, which led to Lloyd's sacking in early 1983, at which point Bobby Charlton, a director at the time, took over as temporary manager before being replaced by <a href="Harry%20McNally">Harry McNally</a>. Under McNally's management, the club stabilised in Division Three and secured a pair of mid-table finishes, but a dreadful 1984–85 season cost him his job, with <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere</a> manager <a href="Bryan%20Hamilton">Bryan Hamilton</a> stepping into the breach. Under Hamilton's management, the club's performances went to the next level and they won their first silverware as a league club that season with the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Freight Rover Trophy</a>. They were beaten in the Northern final of the same competition the following season by <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. More importantly, Hamilton achieved Division Three survival, which had looked an impossible task earlier that season.
The 1985–86 season saw a marked improvement in the club's league form, eventually finishing in fourth position, a then-club record high which would stand for 17 years until 2002–03. Wigan Athletic finished the season just one point outside the promotion places in the final season before the Football League introduced the <a href="Football%20League%20play-offs">play-off system</a> for promotion and relegation. However, Hamilton's feats attracted the attention of First Division <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> and he left to become their manager in the summer of 1986. His assistant, <a href="Ray%20Mathias">Ray Mathias</a>, who had followed him from Tranmere, stepped up to the Wigan Athletic manager's job. Wigan Athletic managed an identical fourth-place finish in the 1986–87 season, but this time were rewarded with the chance to compete for the final promotion place in the new play-off system. (In the first two years of the play-off system, teams finishing third, fourth and fifth joined the team finishing 20th in the division above to play-off for the promotion place; this was changed to the teams finishing third, fourth, fifth and sixth from the 1988–89 season). The Latics lost at the two-legged semi-final stage to <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon</a>, who went on to win the final promotion place.
The fourth-place finishes of the 1985–86 and 1986–87 seasons proved to be the high points of Wigan Athletic's first stint in Division 3. For the next five years, they finished mid-table, flirting with relegation in 1988–89 (at which time Mathias was sacked and the previous manager Bryan Hamilton returned) and 1989–90, until they were relegated for the first time in the club's league history in 1992–93. Wigan Athletic finished in 23rd place, amid tumbling attendances which had fallen from averages of 3,000–4,000 in Wigan Athletic's Division 3 years to just 2,593 in 1992–93. Hamilton resigned shortly before the club were relegated, and was replaced by <a href="Kenny%20Swain">Kenny Swain</a>. A year later, with the club back in the fourth tier of the English League, the Latics finished fourth from bottom, in 19th place. While there was no relegation that season due to the lack of a promotable club in the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a>, this remains the club's lowest-ever finish. The following season would prove to be arguably even worse, as Swain was sacked early in the campaign following a horrific start, and former player <a href="Graham%20Barrow">Graham Barrow</a> took over as manager. Despite the club being rooted to the bottom of the table until the start of December, the second half of the campaign saw a major upturn in form, and they finished well clear of the relegation zone in 15th place. Attendances fell to a lowest-ever Wigan Athletic League average of 1,845 by 1995.
Rising through the league: 1995–2005.
In February 1995, local millionaire and owner of <a href="JJB%20Sports">JJB Sports</a>, <a href="Dave%20Whelan">Dave Whelan</a> purchased the club. Through Whelan's business connections in Spain he attracted three Spaniards to the club – <a href="Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Roberto Martínez</a>, <a href="Isidro%20D%C3%ADaz%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201972%29">Isidro Díaz</a>, and <a href="Jesus%20Seba">Jesus Seba</a> – who became known as the Three Amigos. The trio became the on-pitch symbols of Whelan's ambitious plan to take Wigan Athletic into the Premier League. The Three Amigos were joined at the club by <a href="John%20Deehan">John Deehan</a>, who replaced Barrow as manager during the 1995–96 season following a 6–2 home defeat to <a href="Mansfield%20Town%20F.C.">Mansfield Town</a>. Deehan took the Latics within two points of a play-off place in his first season; the club had in fact been in the final automatic promotion spot with four games remaining, but lost them all and so failed to even make the playoffs. The following year Wigan Athletic became Division Three champions on the last day of the season, <a href="Graeme%20Jones">Graeme Jones</a> scoring a club record 31 league goals in the process. In most seasons they would have been runners-up, but a temporary rule change which saw goals scored take precedence over goal difference allowed them to finish above runners-up <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, who had the same number of points and a better goal difference.
Following a mid-table finish in Division Two the following season, Deehan quit to become <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a>'s assistant at <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>. He was succeeded by <a href="Ray%20Mathias">Ray Mathias</a>, who returned for his third stint as Wigan Athletic manager. Mathias' team won the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> in 1999, beating <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> 1–0 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. The same season the Latics reached the Division Two play-offs, losing 2–1 on aggregate to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Mathias was sacked, and replaced by <a href="John%20Benson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201942%29">John Benson</a>. He led the team to the top of Division Two in his first six months, but they were only able to qualify for the play-offs. In the last <a href="Football%20League%20One%20play-offs">Division Two play-off final</a> played at the old <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, Wigan lost 3–2 after extra time to <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a>.
Benson moved 'upstairs' to the new post of director of football in the summer of 2000, when former <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> manager <a href="Bruce%20Rioch">Bruce Rioch</a> took the manager's job for the 2000–01 season. Rioch was hampered by severe injury problems and after a difficult and often unimpressive first half of the season left the club in February 2001. He was temporarily replaced by club stalwart <a href="Colin%20Greenall">Colin Greenall</a>, before the surprise appointment of <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> for the final eight games of the season. His arrival brought renewed vigour to Wigan Athletic performances, but the club ultimately lost in the play-offs again, this time against <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>, and Bruce left for <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>.
In the summer of 2001, the former Latics forward <a href="Paul%20Jewell">Paul Jewell</a> took over as manager following an unsuccessful spell at <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>. His first season in charge saw mixed results and an embarrassing defeat to non-League <a href="Canvey%20Island%20F.C.">Canvey Island</a> in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> first round, although the club eventually finished in mid-table. Jewell's second season in charge was far more successful. Wigan Athletic went on a run to the quarter-finals of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>, beating <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> opponents <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Brom</a>, <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> and <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> en route. Wigan Athletic won the Division Two championship in 2002–03 with a points total of 100, powered by the goals of then-record £1.2 million signing <a href="Nathan%20Ellington">Nathan Ellington</a>, with a run of 10 consecutive wins along the way. The club lost only four times all season, and Wigan Athletic secured promotion to the second tier of the <a href="The%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> for the first time in their history.
After losing their first <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Division One</a> game, Wigan Athletic confounded expectations to go unbeaten for the next 17 games and topped the division by November 2003. A weak finish saw Wigan Athletic win only three of their last 10 games to finish seventh in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League">Division One</a> – a last-minute goal by <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham</a>'s <a href="Brian%20Deane">Brian Deane</a> in the final game of the season saw the Latics drop out of the play-off places in favour of eventual play-off winners <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>.
Hoping to build on the previous season's disappointing finish, the Latics went one better than <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League">2003–04</a> by remaining unbeaten for the first 17 games of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Football%20League">2004–05</a> season. Along with <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> and <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich</a>, the Latics remained in the promotion hunt all season. By the last day of the season, Sunderland had already won the title and Wigan needed at least a draw against <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> – who themselves needed to win to finish in sixth place – to beat Ipswich to the last automatic promotion spot. A 3–1 victory at the <a href="DW%20Stadium">JJB Stadium</a> earned Wigan Athletic promotion to the top division of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a> for the first time in their 73-year history.
Premier League years and FA Cup victory: 2005–2013.
The club's first Premier League game was a sell-out at the JJB Stadium against holders <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, a 1–0 defeat after an injury-time winner by <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Crespo">Hernán Crespo</a>. A successful run followed, and by November, Wigan were second in the league. Good league form was coupled with an equally strong performance in the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a>, with Wigan reaching their first ever major cup final after defeating <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> on <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals</a> in the semi-final. In the <a href="2006%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">final</a>, Wigan were defeated 4–0 by neighbours <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Wigan Athletic eventually finished the season in 10th place, which remains the club's highest ever league placing. Defender <a href="Pascal%20Chimbonda">Pascal Chimbonda</a> was also included in the 2005–06 PFA Team of the Season, capping off his season by being picked for the <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> squad for the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>.
During the close season, Wigan sold many players who had starred in their first season in the Premier League, such as <a href="Jimmy%20Bullard">Jimmy Bullard</a>, <a href="Jason%20Roberts%20%28footballer%29">Jason Roberts</a> and <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Henchoz">Stéphane Henchoz</a>, while bringing in replacements including <a href="Emile%20Heskey">Emile Heskey</a>, <a href="Denny%20Landzaat">Denny Landzaat</a>, <a href="Chris%20Kirkland">Chris Kirkland</a> and <a href="Antonio%20Valencia">Antonio Valencia</a>. After a mid-table start to the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Premier%20League">2006–07 season</a>, Wigan had eight consecutive losses from mid-December, but was 15th in early March. On the final day of the season, Wigan got a 2–1 away win against <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, which kept them up at the expense of their opponents. The following day, <a href="Paul%20Jewell">Paul Jewell</a> unexpectedly resigned as manager; his assistant <a href="Chris%20Hutchings">Chris Hutchings</a> was appointed as his replacement.
Wigan's third Premier League campaign saw changes in the squad, with <a href="Titus%20Bramble">Titus Bramble</a>, <a href="Mario%20Melchiot">Mario Melchiot</a>, <a href="Jason%20Koumas">Jason Koumas</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Bent">Marcus Bent</a> among the players brought in, and Melchiot was installed as the new club captain. The 2007–08 season began well for Wigan, with <a href="Emile%20Heskey">Emile Heskey</a> recalled to the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England squad</a>, as the first Wigan player to represent England whilst a full member of the club. However, he broke his foot immediately after his England call-up and was out injured for six weeks. The club's league position subsequently worsened, and on the back of a run of six consecutive defeats, Wigan fell into the relegation zone. Whelan took the decision to sack Hutchings on 5 November 2007, after 12 games in charge, reinstating Bruce, who saved the club from relegation.
In the summer of 2008, Bruce signed <a href="Lee%20Cattermole">Lee Cattermole</a> from Middlesbrough for £3.5 million, and Egyptian striker <a href="Amr%20Zaki">Amr Zaki</a> sign on an initial one-year loan. Zaki had scored 10 Premier League goals by February 2009, as Wigan reached seventh place in the table with 34 points from 25 games. January saw the departure of two key first team members, <a href="Wilson%20Palacios">Wilson Palacios</a> and <a href="Emile%20Heskey">Emile Heskey</a>, to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham</a> and <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> respectively. Despite these changes, Wigan finished the season in 11th place with 45 points, their second-best finish ever in the Premier League. On 3 June, Bruce left Wigan for the second time to take over the vacant manager position at <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>. July saw the departure of another key first team member <a href="Antonio%20Valencia">Antonio Valencia</a> to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Before the 2009–10 season got underway, Cattermole left for Sunderland.
Wigan appointed <a href="Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Roberto Martínez</a>, then manager of <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a>, as manager prior to the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Premier%20League">2009–10 Premier League</a> season. He previously played for Wigan from 1995 to 2001. On 26 September, they claimed their first three points against a "Big 4" team after beating Chelsea 3–1, with goals from <a href="Titus%20Bramble">Titus Bramble</a>, <a href="Hugo%20Rodallega">Hugo Rodallega</a> and <a href="Paul%20Scharner">Paul Scharner</a>. A late surge that included a 1–0 win over Liverpool and a 3–2 win over Arsenal – the latter of which saw Wigan recover from two goals down with ten minutes remaining to win in injury time – saw the team once more survive relegation. Most notably, having never defeated any of the traditional "<a href="Premier%20League%23%26quot%3BBig%20Four%26quot%3B%20dominance%20%282000%E2%80%9310%29">Big Four</a>" in the league until their win over Chelsea (and with only one win over any of them in cup competitions), Wigan ended the season having defeated three of them at home. Despite this high, the season also saw two humiliating 8 goal defeats, firstly a 9–1 thrashing at <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham</a> in November, and finally an 8–0 defeat to Chelsea on the final day of the season, a match which saw their opponents crowned Premier League champions.
In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Premier%20League">2010–11</a> season, Wigan fell to the bottom of the league by the end of February, following a 4–0 defeat to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. However, despite remaining in the bottom three for the majority of the season, they managed to retain their Premier League status on the last day of the season, defeating <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> at the <a href="Britannia%20Stadium">Britannia Stadium</a> after a goal from <a href="Hugo%20Rodallega">Hugo Rodallega</a>. On 7 May 2012, they simultaneously secured their Premier League status and relegated Blackburn Rovers with a 1–0 victory at <a href="Ewood%20Park">Ewood Park</a>.
In 2013, after beating <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> in the quarter-final and <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> in the semi-final, Wigan reached the <a href="FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> for the first time in their history. In <a href="2013%20FA%20Cup%20final">the final</a>, played at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, Wigan beat <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> 1–0, with a goal by <a href="Ben%20Watson%20%28footballer%20born%20July%201985%29">Ben Watson</a> scored in injury time.
Wigan's first ever major trophy also gave the club a place in the group stage of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>. Following their 4–1 defeat to Arsenal three days later, Wigan Athletic ended their eight-year spell in the Premier League and became the first team to be relegated and win the FA Cup in the same season. On 5 June it was announced that Martínez had left Wigan and had signed for <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> on a four-year deal.
End of the Whelan era: 2013–2018.
<a href="Owen%20Coyle">Owen Coyle</a> became the new manager of Wigan Athletic when Martínez left for <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. The team lost to Manchester United in the <a href="2013%20FA%20Community%20Shield">Community Shield</a>. Coyle left by mutual agreement on 2 December 2013 after a poor start to the season, and was replaced by <a href="Uwe%20R%C3%B6sler">Uwe Rösler</a>. On 12 December in his first match, Wigan were eliminated from the Europa League group stage after defeat to <a href="NK%20Maribor">Maribor</a>. On 9 March 2014 Wigan beat <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> to reach the semi-final of the FA Cup at Wembley for the second successive year, where they played <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, and lost 4–2 on penalties after normal time and <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a> resulted in a 1–1 draw. After finishing 5th in the Championship, Wigan lost their play-off semi-final to <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers">Queens Park Rangers</a>.
Rösler was sacked in November 2014 with the club in the relegation places, and was replaced by <a href="Malky%20Mackay">Malky Mackay</a>. Whelan resigned as chairman on 3 March 2015, remaining as owner but handing over the chairmanship to his grandson <a href="David%20Sharpe%20%28football%20club%20chairman%29">David Sharpe</a>. The following month, with Wigan in danger of relegation to <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a>, Mackay was sacked and replaced by former Wigan captain <a href="Gary%20Caldwell">Gary Caldwell</a>, yet the team ended the season with relegation. The squad changed drastically, including the signings of <a href="Will%20Grigg">Will Grigg</a> from <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> and <a href="Reece%20James%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201993%29">Reece James</a> from <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a>. The side lost only once in 23 matches in the second half of the season and won the division, with Grigg the league's top scorer with 25 goals.
In October 2016, following a poor start to the season, Caldwell was sacked as manager and replaced by Manchester United coach <a href="Warren%20Joyce">Warren Joyce</a>. Results did not improve under Joyce, who was sacked in March 2017. Wigan were subsequently relegated back to League One in April and interim manager <a href="Graham%20Barrow">Graham Barrow</a> left, ending a 15-year association with the club. <a href="Paul%20Cook%20%28footballer%29">Paul Cook</a>, who had just won <a href="Football%20League%20Two">League Two</a> with <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>, was appointed Wigan manager in June 2017.
In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20EFL%20League%20One">2017–18 League One season</a>, Wigan finished top winning promotion back to the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a>. Their promotion was sealed by a 4–0 win against <a href="Fleetwood%20Town%20F.C.">Fleetwood Town</a>. In the <a href="2017-18%20FA%20Cup">2017–18 FA Cup</a>, Wigan beat <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in the fifth round at home, winning 1–0 after Will Grigg scored in the 79th minute. In the quarter-finals, they were knocked out by <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> in a 2–0 loss. At the end of the season it was announced that the Whelan family had agreed a deal to sell the club, stadium and training facilities to the Hong Kong-based International Entertainment Corporation (IEC) in a £22m deal. On 2 November 2018, IEC received shareholder approval to complete the acquisition of the football club, ending 23 years of Whelan family ownership.
In the 2018–19 season, Wigan finished 18th in the Championship with 52 points, well clear of the relegation zone.
Administration, financial instability, and new ownership: 2020–present.
On 4 June 2020, IEC sold the majority of Wigan Athletic shareholdings to Hong Kong-based Next Leader Fund; the sale was formally ratified and approved by the shareholders of IEC, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the EFL. On 1 July 2020, the club – standing 14th in the Championship, eight points clear of relegation, in a season delayed due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">COVID-19 pandemic</a> – announced it had gone into <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> as Next Leader Fund had refused to invest promised money. The insolvency left Wigan facing a 12-point deduction; the sanction would be applied at the end of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.%20season">2019–20 season</a> if the club finished outside the bottom three after 46 games. <a href="Wigan%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Wigan</a> MP <a href="Lisa%20Nandy">Lisa Nandy</a> and <a href="Mayor%20of%20Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester mayor</a> <a href="Andy%20Burnham">Andy Burnham</a> wrote a joint letter to Parry calling for an investigation into the club's takeover. Players had not been paid and there was talk of club staff being made redundant and of players being offered for sale, they said. Wigan's supporters club also called for an investigation and for financial support from the EFL; supporters, backed by Nandy, later launched an online petition to try to trigger a parliamentary debate around the EFL's owners' and directors' test.
On 7 July, 75 (approximately half) of the club's non-playing staff were made redundant by the administrators. 
Meanwhile, on 7 July 2020 the club had appealed against the 12-point deduction imposed by the EFL for entering administration. On 14 July, Wigan recorded their biggest League victory, beating <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> 8–0. This, combined with other results, meant Wigan would not finish in the relegation places, so the 12-point deduction would be applied at the end of the current season with the relegation confirmed on 4 August. 
On 17 August 2020, it was reported that Au Yeung Wai Kay, the club's owner, had, on 23 June, asked Begbies Traynor about putting it into administration before completing his takeover. Wigan supporters began a fund-raising effort, initially raising £500,000 to help secure the club's future, and then raising £200,000 more. 
Administrators had been confident a sale would be agreed by their deadline, but later revised their opinion.
By early March 2021, the administrators were in advanced talks with a consortium, Phoenix 2021 Ltd, led by <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a> businessmen Abdulrahman Al-Jasmi and <a href="Talal%20Al%20Hammad">Talal Mubarak al-Hammad</a>, which was confirmed officially on 30 March. In May, the former administrators repaid £171,000 raised by supporters to keep the club going when it first went into administration. 
The club finished the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.%20season">2020–21</a> season in 20th position, one point above the relegation places. Wigan Athletic won the League One title under <a href="Leam%20Richardson">Leam Richardson</a> in the following season, earning promotion back to the Championship after a final day 3–0 victory at <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.">Shrewsbury Town</a>.
On 7 March 2023, Wigan reported a £7.7m loss for the financial year to June 2022. Four days later, Wigan released a statement saying there would be a temporary delay in meeting wage obligations due to liquidity issues; the EFL was aware of the situation and on 20 March 2023, bottom-of-the-table Wigan were docked three points for failing to pay players, having had a previous EFL sanction for non-payment suspended. At the end of the 2022–23 season, they were relegated from the Championship.
In late May 2023, Wigan were hit with two further points deductions and would therefore start its next season with minus eight points. On 12 June, HMRC lodged a winding-up petition over unpaid tax. On 14 June 2023, Wigan-born billionaire and Wigan Warriors RLFC co-owner Mike Danson bought the club.
Stadium.
Wigan Athletic's stadium is the 25,138 capacity <a href="DW%20Stadium">DW Stadium</a>, part of the Robin Park complex in Wigan. It has been the club's home since the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a> season. Wigan Athletic owns the stadium, but leases the ground to <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> team <a href="Wigan%20Warriors">Wigan Warriors</a>. The stadium cost £30 million to construct. Previously, home games were played at <a href="Springfield%20Park%20%28Wigan%29">Springfield Park</a>, the former home of Wigan Borough, which was demolished in June 1999; it is now the site of a housing development. The record attendance at the DW Stadium (then known as the JJB Stadium) for Wigan Athletic is 25,133 for a game against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> on 11 May 2008 – the final match of the 2007–08 season.
The JJB Stadium was the fourth attempt at re-development/re-location for Wigan Athletic, the first coming in 1986 when then-chairman Bill Kenyon revealed plans for a 15,000 all-seater development at Springfield Park including a hotel and shopping facilities. The club was to play at the nearby Woodhouse Stadium (formerly Wigan Municipal Stadium – now demolished) while the building work took place. In 1990, Kenyon submitted his second scheme which would cost £3m, hold 12–15,000 fans and involved moving the pitch nearer to the car park. Neither efforts got past the planning stage. The next chairman, Stephen Gage, spent most of 1993 and 1994 trying to relocate the Latics to the then Robin Park Stadium (now demolished) until his plans were scuppered by Wigan Council when the local council announced plans for their own ground involving Wigan Warriors. Gage finally admitted defeat when he sold the Latics to Dave Whelan on 27 February 1995 for around £1m.
Plans for the JJB Stadium were first published in 1997. Contracts for the new stadium were signed in late 1997 and work began immediately. Originally the ground was to be built for both Wigan Athletic and <a href="Orrell%20R.U.F.C.">Orrell R.U.F.C.</a>, as grants were only available for multi-use stadia at that time. Wigan Warriors did not figure in the equation until Whelan bought the rugby league club some 12 months later after protracted negotiations with the directors of the rugby league club. The modern all-seater stadium was officially opened on 4 August 1999. Its inauguration was marked with a friendly between Wigan and neighbours Manchester United, who were then reigning European Champions, with <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> officially opening the stadium. However, Wigan Athletic hosted <a href="Morecambe%20F.C.">Morecambe</a> three days earlier on 1 August as a dress rehearsal for the official opening against Manchester United. The game was played during a violent electrical storm and torrential rain, even so, 4,020 supporters attended and the game ended in a goalless draw. The first competitive football match took place on 7 August 1999, with Wigan Athletic facing Scunthorpe United in a Division 2 match. <a href="Simon%20Haworth">Simon Haworth</a> scored twice, including the first competitive goal at the new stadium, as Athletic won 3–0.
On 7 March 2005 <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Police">Greater Manchester Police</a> announced that it would stop policing Wigan Athletic matches at the stadium from 2 April. This move left Wigan Athletic facing the prospect of playing their home games in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in an empty stadium, so they paid the money they owed to the police. The club appealed against the payments in court and won, with the claims expected to earn the club around £37,000.
On 25 March 2009 it was announced that Wigan Athletic would change the name of their stadium to The DW Stadium, after chairman Dave Whelan's commercial venture, DW Sports Fitness. For 2013–14 <a href="Europa%20League">Europa League</a> fixtures held at the stadium, the ground was known as The Wigan Athletic Stadium.
Supporters.
Wigan Athletic Official Supporters Club (formerly known as Wigan Athletic Supporters Travel Club) is the official supporters' association of Wigan Athletic Football Club. The supporters club are a non-profit organisation run by volunteers and meet before home matches in the South Stand Bar.
The Latics' most vocal supporters can be found in the East Stand of the DW Stadium which houses up to 8,206 fans The South Stand of the ground is the family stand.
A long-standing song sung by fans of the club is "<a href="You%20Are%20My%20Sunshine">You Are My Sunshine</a>". In more recent times, "<a href="I%27m%20a%20Believer">I'm a Believer</a>", the <a href="Hokey%20cokey">Hokey cokey</a>, "<a href="We%20Built%20This%20City">We Built This City</a>" and "<a href="Gold%20%28Spandau%20Ballet%20song%29">Gold</a>" are among some of the songs that have been adapted by Wigan supporters.
The club has one unofficial fanzine, The Mudhutter, which is released between 5 and 6 times during the season.
Resulting from a number of incidents at Latics matches where smoke bombs were used by fans (resulting in 17 banning orders as a result of one fixture), several club statements were issued and police presence was increased at some matches. Data from the UK Football Policing Unit found that Wigan Athletic along with Everton and Manchester United had the highest number of incidents involving pyrotechnics.
Wigan's return to the Championship saw an average away following of over 1,200. This figure did not include Europa League, Community Shield, League Cup and FA Cup fixtures, where on average supporters turned up in greater numbers.
In 2013, the club sold out their 25,000 allocation for the FA Cup final and sold 20,000 tickets for the FA Cup semi-final. A total of 5,500 was also sold for the FA Community Shield in the same year.
In 2014, hundreds of fans took part in a charity walk from Wigan to Bolton in aid of local charity Joseph's Goal. Joseph was Wigan's mascot in the 2013 FA Cup final, led out by captain <a href="Emmerson%20Boyce">Emmerson Boyce</a>.
On Boxing Day, over the years many fans have chosen to attend Wigan Athletic's match in fancy dress. This is particularly prominent with away fixtures on that day where the fans are known as the 'Banana Army'. However, on Boxing Day in 2014 a boycott of the club's fixture against Leeds United was ordered by some supporters due to the ticket prices for the match at Elland Road. Around 750 away fans attended the match.
During the 2014–15 season, a Fan Advisory Board (FAB) was set up by the club to allow supporters of Wigan Athletic to have a greater say on any issues they may have. The board meets every month to six weeks with the first meeting having taken place in November 2014.
Mascot.
In August 2019, the club announced that a giant pie, called Crusty, would serve as the team's new mascot for the 2019–2020 season. Crusty The Pie was chosen following a competition in which more than 90 primary schools were invited to submit ideas, with over half of the entries opting for a pie.
Rivalries.
Since Wigan Athletic's admission to the Football League in 1978, the club has built up several rivalries, mainly with <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>, the club's primary derby match.
One rivalry that has arisen in recent years has been that with <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, since the first time they met in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in 1998, the season in which City gained passage to the 1999 Division Two play-off final through the “Hand of Goat”. Wigan met City in the <a href="2013%20FA%20Cup%20final">2013 FA Cup final</a> and beat them 1–0. Since then, City have failed to beat Wigan in the competition; losing 2–1 at the Etihad in the 2013–14 FA Cup quarter-final and, in February 2018, losing 1–0 with third tier Wigan beating eventual Premier League champions City with a Will Grigg goal.
Wigan also have other local rivalries with <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>, <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a>, <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> and <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a>.
One of the club's longest and recently forgotten rivalries was with nearby Lancashire based club <a href="Chorley%20F.C.">Chorley</a>, although the two clubs have not played a league game since 1971 when they were in the Northern Premier League. The last time Wigan played Chorley was in the first round of the FA Cup in 2020, with non-League Chorley beating an administration-stricken Wigan 3–2 after extra-time.

Burnley F.C.

Burnley Football Club () is an English <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Burnley">Burnley</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, that competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the first tier of <a href="Football%20in%20England">English football</a>. Founded on 18 May 1882, the club was one of the first to become <a href="Professionalism%20in%20association%20football">professional</a> (in 1883) and subsequently put pressure on <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> to permit payments to players. The club entered the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time in <a href="1885%E2%80%9386%20FA%20Cup">1885–86</a> and was one of the 12 founder members of the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League">1888–89</a>. From the 1950s until the 1970s, under chairman <a href="Bob%20Lord%20%28football%20chairman%29">Bob Lord</a>, the club became renowned for its youth policy and <a href="Scout%20%28association%20football%29">scouting system</a>, and was one of the first to set up a purpose-built <a href="Training%20ground%20%28association%20football%29">training ground</a>.
Burnley have been <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">champions of England</a> twice, in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1920–21</a> and <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1959–60</a>, have won the FA Cup once, in <a href="1913%E2%80%9314%20FA%20Cup">1913–14</a>, and have won the <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a> twice, in <a href="1960%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">1960</a> and <a href="1973%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">1973</a>. They have been runners-up in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> twice, in <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Football%20League">1919–20</a> and <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Football%20League">1961–62</a>, and FA Cup runners-up twice, in <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20FA%20Cup">1946–47</a> and <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20FA%20Cup">1961–62</a>. Burnley are one of only five sides to have won <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">all four professional divisions of English football</a>, along with <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>, <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>, <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>. During the 1920–21 season, Burnley embarked on a 30-match unbeaten league run, setting an English record. When the team won the 1959–60 Football League, the town of Burnley—with 80,000 inhabitants—became one of the smallest to have an English first-tier champion.
The team have played home games at <a href="Turf%20Moor">Turf Moor</a> since 1883, after they had moved from their original premises at Calder Vale. The club colours of <a href="Wine%20%28color%29%23Claret">claret</a> and blue were adopted before the <a href="1910%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football">1910–11</a> season in tribute to the then Football League champions <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. The club is nicknamed "the Clarets" because of the dominant colour of its <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">home shirts</a>. Burnley's current emblem is based on the town's coat of arms. The team have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, with whom they contest the <a href="East%20Lancashire%20derby">East Lancashire Derby</a>.
History.
Beginnings and the first major honours (1882–1946).
The club was founded on 18 May 1882 by members of <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a> team Burnley Rovers, who voted for a shift to <a href="association%20football">association football</a>, since several other <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a>s in the area had changed their codes to football. The suffix "Rovers" was dropped a few days later. The side won their first silverware in 1883: the Dr Dean's Cup, a <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament">knockout competition</a> between amateur clubs in the Burnley area. By the end of the year, the club turned <a href="Professionalism%20in%20association%20football">professional</a> and signed many Scottish players. Burnley refused to join the <a href="The%20Football%20Association">Football Association</a> (FA) and its <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, since the association barred professional players. In 1884, Burnley led a group of 35 other clubs in the formation of the breakaway <a href="British%20Football%20Association">British Football Association</a> (BFA) to challenge the FA's supremacy. The FA changed its rule in 1885, allowing professionalism, and Burnley made their first appearance in the FA Cup in <a href="1885%E2%80%9386%20FA%20Cup">1885–86</a>. In October 1886, Burnley's <a href="Turf%20Moor">Turf Moor</a> became the first professional ground to be visited by a member of the <a href="British%20royal%20family">Royal Family</a>, when <a href="Prince%20Albert%20Victor%2C%20Duke%20of%20Clarence%20and%20Avondale">Prince Albert Victor</a> attended a <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly</a> between Burnley and <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. The club was among the twelve founders of the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1888–89</a> and one of the six based in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. In the second match, <a href="William%20Tait%20%28footballer%29">William Tait</a> became the first player to score a league <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>, when his three goals gave Burnley their inaugural win in the competition. In <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1889–90</a>, they claimed their first <a href="Lancashire%20Senior%20Cup">Lancashire Cup</a>, after beating local rivals <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers">Blackburn Rovers</a> in the final.
Burnley were <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> for the first time in <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20Football%20League">1896–97</a>. The team won the division the <a href="1897%E2%80%9398%20Football%20League">next season</a>; only two of thirty matches were lost before promotion was gained through a four-team <a href="Playoffs">play-off</a> series called <a href="Football%20League%20test%20matches">test matches</a>, although the last game against <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> club <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke</a> was controversial. The tie finished 0–0 as both needed only a <a href="Tie%20%28draw%29">draw</a> for a top flight place; it was later named "[t]he match without a shot at goal". Burnley were relegated again in <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20Football%20League">1899–1900</a> and found themselves at the centre of controversy when their <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a>, <a href="Jack%20Hillman">Jack Hillman</a>, attempted to bribe opponents <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in the last match of the season. It is possibly the earliest recorded case of <a href="match%20fixing">match fixing</a> in football. The side continued to play in the Second Division and even finished in bottom place in <a href="1902%E2%80%9303%20Football%20League">1902–03</a>—but were <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-elected</a>—as the club got into financial difficulties.
Harry Windle was named chairman in 1909, after which the club's finances turned around. The directors appointed <a href="John%20Haworth">John Haworth</a> as the new <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a> in 1910, who changed the club's colours from green to the <a href="Wine%20%28color%29%23Claret">claret</a> and blue of <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, the then First Division champions, as Haworth and the Burnley committee believed it might bring a change of fortune. In <a href="1912%E2%80%9313%20in%20English%20football">1912–13</a>, the side won promotion to the first tier; the following season, Burnley won their first major honour, beating <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the <a href="1914%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1914 FA Cup Final</a>. <a href="Bert%20Freeman">Bert Freeman</a> scored the only goal, as Burnley became the first club to defeat five top tier sides in one cup season. <a href="Tommy%20Boyle%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201886%29">Tommy Boyle</a> became the first <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> to receive the trophy from a reigning monarch, King <a href="George%20V">George V</a>. The team finished second to <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Football%20League">1919–20</a>, before winning their first ever First Division championship in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1920–21</a>. Burnley lost the opening three games but went unbeaten in the following 30 league matches, setting an English record. Nine seasons later, the team were relegated to the Second Division. They struggled in the second tier and avoided a further relegation in <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20Football%20League">1931–32</a> by two points. The years through to the outbreak of the Second World War were characterised by mid-table league finishes.
Progressive and golden era (1946–1976).
In the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Football%20League">first season</a> of post-war League football, Burnley gained promotion and reached the <a href="1947%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1947 FA Cup Final</a> but were defeated by <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a>. The team's defence was nicknamed "The Iron Curtain", since they only conceded 29 goals in 42 league matches. <a href="Alan%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201914%29">Alan Brown</a> was appointed manager in 1954, and <a href="Bob%20Lord%20%28football%20chairman%29">Bob Lord</a> chairman a year later. The club became one of the most progressive around under their tenures. Burnley were one of the first to set up a purpose-built <a href="Training%20ground%20%28association%20football%29">training ground</a>, at <a href="Gawthorpe%20Hall">Gawthorpe</a>, and they became renowned for their youth policy and <a href="Scout%20%28association%20football%29">scouting system</a>, which yielded many young talents. In 1958, former Burnley player <a href="Harry%20Potts">Harry Potts</a> was appointed manager. His squad mainly revolved around the duo of captain <a href="Jimmy%20Adamson">Jimmy Adamson</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20McIlroy">Jimmy McIlroy</a>, the team's <a href="playmaker">playmaker</a>. Potts often employed the then unfashionable <a href="4-4-2%20formation">4–4–2 formation</a> and he implemented a <a href="Total%20Football">Total Football</a> playing style.
Burnley clinched a second First Division title in <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1959–60</a>. They had not topped the table until the last match was played out. The squad cost only <a href="Pound%20sign">£</a>13,000 (equivalent to £ in 2024) in <a href="Transfer%20%28association%20football%29">transfer</a> fees—£8,000 on McIlroy in 1950 and £5,000 on <a href="Full%20back%20%28association%20football%29">left-back</a> <a href="Alex%20Elder">Alex Elder</a> in 1959. The other players came from their <a href="Burnley%20F.C.%20Academy">youth academy</a>. With 80,000 inhabitants, the town of Burnley became one of the smallest to have an English first tier champion. They travelled to the United States after the season ended to represent England in the <a href="International%20Soccer%20League">International Soccer League</a>, the first modern international American soccer tournament. The following season, Burnley played in <a href="UEFA%20competitions">European competition</a> for the first time in the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup">1960–61 European Cup</a>. They defeated former <a href="List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals">finalists</a> <a href="Stade%20de%20Reims">Reims</a> in the first round, but went out against <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> in the quarter-finals. The team finished the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1961–62 First Division</a> as runners-up to newcomers <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> after winning only one of the last ten matches, and had a run to the <a href="1962%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1962 FA Cup Final</a> but lost against <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. Adamson was named <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a>, however, with McIlroy as runner-up.
The <a href="Maximum%20wage%23Association%20football">maximum wage</a> in the Football League was abolished in 1961, which meant that clubs from small towns like Burnley could no longer compete financially with sides from bigger towns and cities. The controversial departure of McIlroy to Stoke City in 1963 and Adamson's retirement in 1964 also damaged the club's fortunes. Burnley retained their place in the First Division throughout the decade, however, finishing third in <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20in%20English%20football">1965–66</a> to qualify for the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1966–67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>. Potts was replaced by Adamson as manager in 1970. Adamson hailed his squad as the "Team of the Seventies", but he was unable to halt the slide as relegation followed in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Football%20League">1970–71</a>. Burnley won the Second Division title in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Football%20League">1972–73</a>, and were invited to play in the <a href="1973%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">1973 FA Charity Shield</a>, where they emerged as winners against <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. In 1975, the team were victims of one of the great FA Cup shocks of all time when <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon</a>, then in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>, won 1–0 at Turf Moor. Adamson left the club in January 1976, and relegation from the First Division followed later that year. During this period, a drop in home attendances combined with an enlarged debt forced Burnley to sell star players such as <a href="Martin%20Dobson">Martin Dobson</a> and <a href="Leighton%20James">Leighton James</a>, which caused a rapid decline.
Near oblivion and recovery (1976–2009).
The team were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for the first time in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1979–80</a>. Under the management of former Burnley player <a href="Brian%20Miller%20%28footballer%29">Brian Miller</a>, they returned to the second tier as champions in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1981–82</a>. However, this return was short-lived and lasted only one year. Managerial changes continued to be made in a search for success; Miller was replaced by <a href="Frank%20Casper">Frank Casper</a> in early 1983, he by <a href="John%20Bond%20%28footballer%29">John Bond</a> before the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1983–84</a> season and Bond himself by <a href="John%20Benson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201942%29">John Benson</a> a season later. Bond was the first manager since <a href="Frank%20Hill">Frank Hill</a> (1948–1954) without a previous playing career at the club. He was criticised by the fans for signing expensive players increasing Burnley's debt, and for selling the young talents <a href="Lee%20Dixon">Lee Dixon</a>, <a href="Brian%20Laws">Brian Laws</a> and <a href="Trevor%20Steven">Trevor Steven</a>. Benson was in charge when Burnley were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> for the first time at the end of the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1984–85</a> season. The team avoided relegation to the <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">Football Conference</a>, the highest level of <a href="non-League%20football">non-League football</a>, on the last day in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1986–87</a>, after they won against <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Orient</a> and their rivals drew or lost.
In 1988, Burnley played <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> in the <a href="1988%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup%20Final">Final</a> of the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Associate Members' Cup</a> but lost 2–0. The match was attended by 80,000 people, a record for a match between two sides from the fourth tier. The team won the Fourth Division in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1991–92</a> under manager <a href="Jimmy%20Mullen%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201952%29">Jimmy Mullen</a>. He had succeeded Casper in October 1991 and won his first nine league matches as manager. By winning the fourth tier, Burnley became only the second club to win <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">all four professional divisions of English football</a>, after Wolverhampton Wanderers. Burnley won the <a href="EFL%20League%20One%20play-offs">Second Division play-offs</a> in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1993–94</a> and gained promotion to the second tier. Relegation followed after one season, and in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1997–98</a> only a last-day victory over <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a> prevented relegation back into the fourth tier. Under manager <a href="Stan%20Ternent">Stan Ternent</a>, Burnley finished second in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000</a> and won promotion to the second tier.
In early 2002, financial problems caused by the collapse of <a href="ITV%20Digital">ITV Digital</a> brought the club close to <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>. Ternent was sacked in 2004, after he avoided relegation with a squad composed of several <a href="Loan%20%28sports%29">loaned players</a> and some players who were not entirely fit. The <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">2008–09</a> campaign, with <a href="Owen%20Coyle">Owen Coyle</a> in charge, ended with promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> were defeated in the <a href="2009%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">Championship play-off Final</a>, which meant a return to the top flight after 33 years. Burnley also reached the semi-final of the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> for the first time in over 25 years but were beaten on <a href="Two-legged%20tie">aggregate</a> by Tottenham in the last minutes of the second leg.
Premier League football and back in Europe (2009–present).
Promotion made the town of Burnley one of the smallest to host a Premier League club. The team started the season well and became the first newly promoted side in the competition to win their first four home games. However, Coyle left the club in January 2010 to manage local rivals Bolton Wanderers. He was replaced by former Burnley player Brian Laws, but the team's form plummeted and they were relegated after a single season. <a href="Sean%20Dyche">Sean Dyche</a> was appointed manager in October 2012. In his first full season in charge, Dyche guided Burnley back to the Premier League in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a> on a tight budget and with a small squad. The team went down after one season but won the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> title on their return in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">2015–16</a>, when they equaled their 2013–14 tally of 93 points, and ended the season with a run of 23 league games undefeated. In 2017, the club completed construction of Barnfield Training Centre—the replacement of Gawthorpe—with Dyche being involved in the training ground's design. Burnley finished seventh in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">2017–18</a>, which meant qualification for the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2018–19 UEFA Europa League</a> and a return to European football after 51 years. The team failed to reach the group stage, as they were eliminated in the play-off round by Greek club <a href="Olympiacos%20F.C.">Olympiacos</a>.
In December 2020, American investment company ALK Capital acquired an 84% stake in Burnley for £170 million. It was the first time the club was run by anyone other than local businessmen and Burnley supporters. In <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">2021–22</a>, Burnley were relegated back to the Championship after they lost on the final matchday and finished in 18th place. In June 2022, the Belgian <a href="Vincent%20Kompany">Vincent Kompany</a> was appointed Burnley's manager, becoming the first person from outside the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> to manage the club. During his first months in charge, he signed 16 players—mostly young and foreign—as he rebuilt the squad on a budget. Kompany also implemented a possession-based, attacking style of play. Burnley <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">secured promotion</a> back to the Premier League with seven matches remaining—a Championship record—before winning the Championship title following a 1–0 victory at local rivals Blackburn Rovers.
Club identity.
Kits and colours.
In the early years, Burnley used various <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a> designs and colours. Throughout the first eight years, there were various permutations of blue and white, the colours of the club's forerunners Burnley Rovers. Before the start of the <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">1890–91</a> season, the club adopted an all-blue shirt, but changed it to all-white mid-season. After several years of claret and amber stripes, for much of the mid-1890s a combination of black with amber was used, although the team wore a shirt with pink and white stripes during the <a href="1894%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1894–95</a> season. Between 1897 and 1900, the club used an all-red shirt and from 1900 until 1910 it wore an all-green jersey. In 1910, Burnley changed their colours to claret and blue, which they have had for most of their history, save for a spell in white shirts during the second half of the 1930s and the Second World War. The adoption of the claret and blue combination paid homage to Football League champions Aston Villa, who wore those colours. Burnley's committee and manager John Haworth believed it might bring a change of fortune. The club decided to re-register its colours as claret and blue in 1946, partly due to <a href="Letter%20to%20the%20editor">readers' letters</a> to the "<a href="Burnley%20Express">Burnley Express</a>".
Burnley's jerseys were manufactured by local companies until 1975, when <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> became the first to have its logo on the club's shirt. Since 1975, the team have had a variety of kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors. The club's first kit sponsor was POCO in 1982, while the mobile game "Golf Clash" became its first sleeve sponsor in 2017.
Crest.
Burnley's first use of a <a href="Crest%20%28sports%29">crest</a> was in December 1887, when they wore the <a href="Royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal arms</a> on the shirt. Prince Albert Victor had watched the team play against Bolton Wanderers at Turf Moor in October 1886—the first visit to a professional football ground by a member of the royal family. To commemorate the visit, the club received a set of white jerseys featured with a blue sash and embellished with the royal coat of arms. The crest was regularly worn on the shirts until 1895, when it disappeared. During the 1914 FA Cup Final, watched by King George V, it featured again on the kits. From 1914, the team played in unadorned shirts, although they wore the coat of arms of Burnley during the <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20FA%20Cup%23Semi-Finals">1934–35 FA Cup semi-final</a> and the 1947 FA Cup Final. After winning the First Division in 1960, Burnley were allowed to wear the town's crest on their shirts. From 1969 to 1975, the team bore the letters "BFC" running downwards from left to right. In 1975, the club adopted a horizontal "BFC" <a href="Monogram">cypher</a> lettered in gold. Burnley used a designed badge with elements from the town and the club on their home shirts from 1979, before they adopted a simple horizontal "B.F.C." in 1983, lettered in white. In 1987, the club reinstated the crest used from 1979 to 1983. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1959–60 First Division title win in 2009, Burnley reintroduced the logo used from 1960 to 1969. The following season, its Latin motto "Pretiumque et Causa Laboris" (English: "The prize and the cause of [our] labour") was replaced with the inscription "Burnley Football Club". In 2023, Burnley coloured the elements in white and placed them on a claret shield.
The club's current badge is based on the town's coat of arms. The stork at the top of the crest refers to the Starkie family, who were prominent in the Burnley area. In its mouth it holds a <a href="Lacy%20knot">Lacy knot</a>, of the <a href="de%20Lacy">de Lacy</a> family, who held Burnley in the Middle Ages. The stork stands on a hill and cotton plants—which represents the town's cotton heritage. Beneath, the hand represents the town's motto "Hold to the Truth", derived from the <a href="Towneley%20family">Towneley family</a>. The two bees refer to the town's hard work ethic, while the lion represents royalty. The <a href="Chevron%20%28insignia%29">chevron</a> is a reference to the <a href="River%20Brun">River Brun</a>, which runs through the town.
Stadium.
The team have played their home games at Turf Moor since February 1883, which replaced their original premises at Calder Vale. The Turf Moor site has been used for sport since at least 1843, when <a href="Burnley%20Cricket%20Club">Burnley Cricket Club</a> moved to the area. In 1883, they invited Burnley to a field adjacent to the cricket pitch. Both clubs have remained there since, and only Lancashire rivals <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> have continuously occupied their stadium—<a href="Deepdale">Deepdale</a>—for longer.
The ground originally consisted of only a pitch and the initial grandstand was not built until 1885. In 1888, the first league match at Turf Moor saw Burnley emerge as 4–1 winners over Bolton Wanderers, <a href="Fred%20Poland">Fred Poland</a> netting the first league goal at the stadium. Turf Moor's capacity was increased to 50,000 under the chairman Harry Windle during the 1910s. The ground hosted its only <a href="FA%20Cup%20semi-finals">FA Cup semi-final</a> in 1922, between <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> and <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a>, and five years later it hosted its only full international match, between <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> and <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a> for the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20British%20Home%20Championship">British Home Championship</a>. From the end of the Second World War until the mid-1960s, crowds in the stadium averaged in the 20,000–35,000 range, and Burnley averaged a club-record attendance of 33,621 in the 1947–48 First Division. The attendance record for a single match was already set in 1924 against Huddersfield Town in an FA Cup third round tie, when 54,775 spectators attended. In 1960, in an FA Cup fifth round <a href="Replay%20%28sports%29">replay</a> game against <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a>, there was an official attendance of 52,850. Some of the gates were broken down, however, and many uncounted fans poured into the ground.
Turf Moor consists of four stands: the North Stand (formerly the Longside), the Jimmy McIlroy Stand (formerly the Bee Hole End), the Bob Lord Stand, and the Cricket Field Stand for home and away fans. The current capacity is 21,944 all-seated. Turf Moor's field had a slope until 1974, when the pitch was raised to minimise it. During the mid-1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when the Longside and Bee Hole End terraces were replaced by all-seater stands as a result of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>. In 2019, the club built two corner stands for disabled home supporters between the Jimmy McIlroy and both the North and Bob Lord Stands to meet the Accessible Stadium Guide regulations.
Supporters and rivalries.
Supporters.
Burnley's supporters are mainly drawn from East Lancashire and <a href="West%20Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>. The club is one of the best supported sides in English football <a href="per%20capita">per capita</a>, with average attendances of 20,000 in the Premier League in a town of approximately 73,000 inhabitants. Burnley have numerous <a href="Supporters%27%20groups">supporters' clubs</a> across the United Kingdom and overseas. The club's fans have had a long-standing friendship with supporters of the Dutch team <a href="Helmond%20Sport">Helmond Sport</a> since the 1990s. Several Burnley and Helmond fans regularly make an overseas journey to visit each other's matches. For 2022–23 and 2023–24, Helmond Sport adopted a claret and blue <a href="Away%20colours">away kit</a> in tribute to Burnley.
A frequently sung <a href="Football%20chant">chant</a> since the early 1970s is "No Nay Never", an adaptation of the song "<a href="The%20Wild%20Rover">The Wild Rover</a>", which has lyrics to offend main rivals Blackburn Rovers. In the early 1980s, a <a href="Football%20hooliganism">hooligan firm</a> known as the <a href="Suicide%20Squad%20%28hooligan%20firm%29">Suicide Squad</a> emerged from within Burnley's fanbase. The group later featured on the 2006 hooligan documentary series "<a href="The%20Real%20Football%20Factories">The Real Football Factories</a>". In 2011, 12 members were sentenced to jail for a total of 32 years, after a high-profile incident with Blackburn Rovers supporters in 2009. The firm disbanded after the verdict.
Notable Burnley fans have included football pioneer <a href="Jimmy%20Hogan">Jimmy Hogan</a>, who was a regular attendee at Turf Moor; journalist <a href="Alastair%20Campbell">Alastair Campbell</a>, who has been regularly involved in events with the club; and cricketer <a href="James%20Anderson%20%28cricketer%29">James Anderson</a>, who also worked in Burnley's ticket office on a part-time basis. <a href="Charles%20III">King Charles III</a> is also a supporter of the club. In 2019, Burnley fan Scott Cunliffe was honoured by the <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> with the #EqualGame Award "for his work as a role model highlighting diversity, inclusion and accessibility in football"; he ran to every away Premier League ground during Burnley's <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Burnley%20F.C.%20season">2018–19</a> campaign and raised more than £55,000 for Premier League clubs' community trusts and community projects in Burnley.
A popular drink served at home matches since the First World War is "Béné & Hot"—the French liqueur <a href="B%C3%A9n%C3%A9dictine">Bénédictine</a> topped up with hot water. The <a href="East%20Lancashire%20Regiment">East Lancashire Regiment</a> soldiers acquired a taste for the drink while stationed at the birthplace of the beverage in <a href="F%C3%A9camp">Fécamp</a>, <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, during the war. They drank it with hot water to keep warm in the trenches, and the surviving soldiers later returned to the East Lancashire area with the liqueur. In excess of 30 bottles are sold at each home game, which makes the club one of the world's biggest sellers of Bénédictine; Turf Moor is the only British football ground to sell it.
Rivalries.
Burnley's main rivals are Blackburn Rovers, with whom they contest the <a href="East%20Lancashire%20derby">East Lancashire derby</a>, named after the region both clubs hail from. Games between these sides from <a href="mill%20town">mill town</a>s are also known under the name "Cotton Mills derby". Both are founder members of the Football League and have won the First Division and the FA Cup. The two clubs are separated by only and besides the geographical proximity, they also have a long-standing history of rivalry; the earliest competitive clash was a Football League match in 1888. Four years earlier, however, they had met for the first time in a friendly, "with considerable pride at stake". Burnley hold the better head-to-head record, as the side have won 44 games to Blackburn's 41. Burnley's closest geographic rivals are actually <a href="Accrington%20Stanley%20F.C.">Accrington Stanley</a>, but as they have never competed at the same level—although defunct club <a href="Accrington%20F.C.">Accrington</a> did—there is no significant rivalry between them.
Other rivalries include those with nearby clubs <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a>, <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>. Burnley also share a <a href="Roses%20rivalry">Roses rivalry</a> with West Yorkshire sides <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a> and <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>. The team contested heated matches with <a href="Halifax%20Town%20A.F.C.">Halifax Town</a>, <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a>, <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a> and <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> in the 1980s and 1990s during their time in the lower leagues, although feelings of animosity were mainly one-sided; according to the <a href="Football%20Fans%20Census">Football Fans Census</a> in 2003, Halifax and Stockport supporters considered Burnley to be their main rivals.

Managers.
Burnley-born <a href="Harry%20Bradshaw%20%28football%20manager%29">Harry Bradshaw</a> was Burnley's first manager—he was appointed in August 1894—and was the first to win a league title with the club, taking them to the top of the Second Division at the end of the <a href="1897%E2%80%9398%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">1897–98</a> season. John Haworth was the first manager in the club's history to win a major honour, the <a href="1913%E2%80%9314%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup in 1914</a>; under Haworth, Burnley also became <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">champions of England</a> for the first time in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20Football%20League">1920–21</a>. Harry Potts led the club to its second First Division title during the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20Football%20League">1959–60</a> campaign. Jimmy Adamson (<a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Football%20League%23Second%20Division">1972–73 Second Division</a>), Brian Miller (<a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Football%20League%23Third%20Division">1981–82 Third Division</a>), Jimmy Mullen (<a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Football%20League%23Fourth%20Division">1991–92 Fourth Division</a>), Sean Dyche (<a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Football%20League%20Championship">2015–16 Football League Championship</a>), and Vincent Kompany (<a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20EFL%20Championship">2022–23 EFL Championship</a>) also led Burnley to league titles.
Owners.
In 1897, the club incorporated as a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a>. From their establishment until 2020, Burnley were run by local businessmen and supporters. In December 2020, Velocity Sports Partners (VSP), the sports investment arm of American management firm ALK Capital, acquired an 84% stake in Burnley for £170 million. Alan Pace, <a href="Partner%20%28business%20rank%29">managing partner</a> of ALK Capital, subsequently replaced Mike Garlick as the club's chairman. ALK borrowed much of the takeover money, and the loan debts were transferred to the club. As a result of this <a href="Leveraged%20buyout">leveraged takeover</a>, Burnley went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of around £100 million, at <a href="interest%20rate">interest rate</a>s of about eight per cent. However, in January 2023, Burnley were one of only two Championship clubs to score a "good" rating on Fair Game's "sustainability index", which included calculations of financial stability.
In May 2023, <a href="J.%20J.%20Watt">J. J. Watt</a>, a retired <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> in <a href="American%20football">American football</a>'s <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>, and his wife, former <a href="United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States women's national soccer team</a> international <a href="Kealia%20Watt">Kealia Watt</a>, were announced as new minority investors. In August 2023, <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> group <a href="Dude%20Perfect">Dude Perfect</a> also became minority investors in the club.

The first Burnley player to play in a full international match was <a href="Jack%20Yates%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201861%29">John Yates</a>, who took to the field for England against <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Ireland</a> in March 1889. He scored a hat-trick but was never called up again. In January 1957, 17-year-old <a href="Ian%20Lawson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201939%29">Ian Lawson</a> netted a record four goals on his debut against <a href="Chesterfield%20F.C.">Chesterfield</a> in the FA Cup third round.

The largest defeat is an 11–0 loss to <a href="Darwen%20Old%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Darwen Old Wanderers</a> in the 1885–86 FA Cup first round, when Burnley fielded their <a href="Reserve%20team">reserve side</a>, as most professionals were still prohibited entry due to rules of the FA that season. The team's longest unbeaten run in the league was between 6 September 1920 and 25 March 1921, to which they remained unbeaten for 30 games on their way to the First Division title. It stood as the longest stretch without defeat in a single English professional league season until Arsenal bettered it in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2003–04</a>.
The club's highest home attendance is 54,775, for an FA Cup third round match against Huddersfield Town on 23 February 1924; Burnley's record home attendance in the league is 52,869, for a First Division game against Blackpool on 11 October 1947.

Crystal Palace F.C.

Crystal Palace Football Club, commonly referred to as Palace, is a professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Selhurst">Selhurst</a> in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Croydon">Borough of Croydon</a>, <a href="South%20London">South London</a>, England, which competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the highest level of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a>. Although formally created as a professional outfit in 1905 at the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace Exhibition building</a>, the club's origins can be traced as far back as 1861. The club were elected to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1920, and have overall mainly competed in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, Palace have only dropped below the second tier once for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. 
Palace enjoyed a successful period in the top flight in the late 1980s and early 1990s, achieving their highest ever league finish of third place in the old <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, now known as the Premier League, in the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Football%20League">1990–91</a> season. They were unfortunate to miss out on qualification for the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> at the end of that season due to the limited number of European places available to English clubs after the lifting of the <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> ban caused by the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>. It was also during this period that the club became <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">founder members</a> of the Premier League. Palace have been <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> finalists twice in their history, and have also won two <a href="List%20of%20winners%20of%20English%20Football%20League%20Championship%20and%20predecessors">EFL Championships</a> and a record four Championship <a href="English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-off</a> finals. 
The club used the <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre%23Football">FA Cup final</a> stadium situated inside the grounds of the Palace for their home games between 1905 and 1915, when they were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. In 1924, they moved to their current home at <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a>. 
The club's <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a> colours were claret and blue until 1973, when they changed to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a>, and also share strong rivalries with fellow <a href="South%20London%20derby">South London</a> clubs <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> and <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>.
History.
The Crystal Palace Company (1854–1905).
In 1854, the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace Exhibition building</a> had been relocated from <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park, London</a> and rebuilt in an area of South London next to <a href="Sydenham%20Hill">Sydenham Hill</a>. This area was renamed <a href="Crystal%20Palace%2C%20London">Crystal Palace</a> which included the <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20Park">Crystal Palace Park</a> that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. The Crystal Palace Company who owned the exhibition building founded the Crystal Palace Club in 1857 to play cricket before turning their attention to football. It had been lobbied by existing members of the cricket club to provide a continuation of sporting activities during the winter months. The company formed an amateur <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.%20%281861%29">Crystal Palace</a> football club in 1861. Many of its original players were members of the cricket club, and they shared the same pitch within the Crystal Palace Park.
The amateur club became one of the original founder members of the <a href="Football%20Association">Football Association</a> in 1863, and competed in the first ever <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> competition in <a href="1871%E2%80%9372%20FA%20Cup">1871–72</a>, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the <a href="Royal%20Engineers%20A.F.C.">Royal Engineers</a>. They played in the FA Cup over the next four seasons, but disappeared from historical records after a match against <a href="Barnes%20Football%20Club">Barnes F.C.</a> on 18 December 1875. In 1895, the Football Association found a new permanent venue for the <a href="FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> at the <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre%23Football">sports stadium</a> situated inside the Palace grounds. Some years later the Crystal Palace Company, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form a new professional football club to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area.
Birth of the professional club and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1905–1920).
The professional Crystal Palace football club was formed on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> assistant secretary <a href="Edmund%20Goodman">Edmund Goodman</a>. The club applied for election to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a>, but were rejected and instead found itself in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> Second Division for the <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20Southern%20Football%20League">1905–06</a> season. Palace were successful in their inaugural season achieving promotion to the Southern League First Division, crowned as champions. They also played in the mid-week <a href="United%20League%20%28football%29">United League</a>, finishing runners-up to <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>, and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3–0 away to <a href="New%20Brompton%20F.C.">New Brompton</a>.
Palace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%200%E2%80%931%20Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.%20%281907%29">1907 shock First Round victory</a> over <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> in the FA Cup. The outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> led to the <a href="British%20Admiralty">Admiralty</a> requisitioning the Crystal Palace and its grounds, which meant the club was forced to leave and they moved to the home of nearby West Norwood F.C. at <a href="Herne%20Hill%20Velodrome">Herne Hill Velodrome</a>. Three years later they moved again to <a href="Croydon%20Common%20Athletic%20Ground">the Nest</a> following the demise of <a href="Croydon%20Common%20F.C.">Croydon Common F.C.</a>
1913 FA Cup final bombing.
The Palace stadium was almost destroyed in an attempted <a href="terrorist">terrorist</a> bombing of the <a href="1913%20FA%20Cup%20final">1913 FA Cup final</a>, when the <a href="suffragettes">suffragettes</a> of the <a href="Women%27s%20Social%20and%20Political%20Union">Women's Social and Political Union</a>, plotted to blow up the stands. This was part of the <a href="suffragette%20bombing%20and%20arson%20campaign">suffragette bombing and arson campaign</a>, in which the suffragettes carried out a series of politically motivated bombing and arson attacks nationwide, as part of their campaign for <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>.
Into the Football League (1920–1958).
The club became founder members of the new <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Football League Third Division</a> in the <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20Football%20League">1920–21</a> season, finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. This achievement meant they joined <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>, <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Small Heath</a>, <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, and <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a> as the only clubs at that time to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace then moved to a new stadium <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a> in 1924, where the club still play their home games today.
The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">The Wednesday</a>, with Palace losing 0–1 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a>. Before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Palace made good efforts at promotion, mostly finishing in the top half of the table and were runners-up on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two <a href="Wartime%20League">Wartime League</a>s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-election</a>.
Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958–1973).
The club remained in the Third Division South up until the end of the <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20in%20English%20football">1957–58</a> season, after which the league was restructured with clubs in the bottom half of the Third Division South merging with those in the bottom half of the Third Division North to form a new <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>. Palace had finished fourteenth – just below the cut – and therefore found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman <a href="Arthur%20Wait">Arthur Wait</a> appointed the ex-<a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham</a> manager <a href="Arthur%20Rowe">Arthur Rowe</a> in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a> season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> in the <a href="1962%20European%20Cup%20final">European Cup final</a>. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4–3. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. <a href="Dick%20Graham">Dick Graham</a> and then <a href="Bert%20Head">Bert Head</a> guided Palace to successive promotions in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20in%20English%20football">1963–64</a> and <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20in%20English%20football">1968–69</a>, taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>.
Palace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5–0 home win against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20in%20English%20football">1972–73</a> season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed <a href="Malcolm%20Allison">Malcolm Allison</a> as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.
Bouncing between the divisions (1973–1984).
After the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again and found themselves back in Division Three for the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75</a> season. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from "The Glaziers" to "The Eagles", and ended its association with claret and blue <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a> colours by changing to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20FA%20Cup">1975–76 FA Cup</a>, beating <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds</a> and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> along the way, but lost 0–2 in the semi-final at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a> to the eventual winners, <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. Allison resigned at the end of the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football">1975–76</a> season after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a>' management that Palace moved back up to the top flight with promotions in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77</a> and <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20in%20English%20football">1978–79</a>; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.
That team from 1979 was dubbed the "Team of the Eighties", because it included a number of very talented young players who had emerged from the youth team which won the <a href="FA%20Youth%20Cup">FA Youth Cup</a> in 1976–77 and 1977–78, and they were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20in%20English%20football">1979–80</a> season. However, financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that group of players, and this ultimately led to Palace being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20in%20English%20football">1980–81</a>, coinciding with <a href="Ron%20Noades">Ron Noades</a>'s takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier and Noades even appointed the ex-<a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton</a> manager <a href="Alan%20Mullery">Alan Mullery</a>, which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.
Steve Coppell years (1984–1993).
On 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> player <a href="Steve%20Coppell">Steve Coppell</a> who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and he rebuilt the club steadily over the next few years which resulted in the Eagles achieving promotion back to the top flight via the <a href="English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-offs</a> in <a href="1989%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23Second%20Division">1988–89</a>. Palace followed this up by reaching the <a href="1990%20FA%20Cup%20final">1990 FA Cup final</a>, drawing 3–3 with Manchester United after <a href="Extra%20time%20%28football%29">extra-time</a> in the first match, but losing the replay 0–1. The club were able to build on this success and the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Football%20League">1990–91</a> season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were unfortunate to miss out on a European place at the end of that season partly due to the <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> ban on English clubs caused by the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>. Though by that time the ban had been lifted, it resulted in England being unranked in the <a href="UEFA%20coefficient">UEFA coefficient</a> rankings used that season, which meant the English top flight was only entitled to one European place in the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, and this went to the runners-up Liverpool. The club also returned to <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> and won the <a href="Full%20Members%20Cup">Full Members Cup</a> beating <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> 4–1 after extra-time in the <a href="1991%20Full%20Members%27%20Cup%20Final">final</a>. During the following season star striker <a href="Ian%20Wright">Ian Wright</a> left the club to join <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. Palace finished tenth, and became a founding member of the new <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">1992–93</a>.
The club sold <a href="Mark%20Bright">Mark Bright</a> to Sheffield Wednesday, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and they struggled to score goals throughout the season. Palace were relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for the highest number of points for a relegated club. Coppell resigned and <a href="Alan%20Smith%20%28manager%29">Alan Smith</a>, his assistant at the club, took over as manager.
The yo-yo years (1993–1998).
Alan Smith's first season as manager saw Palace win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League. Their stay on this occasion proved both eventful and controversial. On 25 January 1995, Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park in which United forward <a href="Eric%20Cantona">Eric Cantona</a> was sent off. He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons, and retaliated with a flying kick. Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail, reduced to 120 hours <a href="community%20service">community service</a> on appeal. Simmons was immediately banned from Selhurst Park, and later found guilty on two charges of threatening Cantona. More was to follow in March, when Palace striker <a href="Chris%20Armstrong%20%28footballer%20born%201971%29">Chris Armstrong</a> was suspended by the FA for failing a drugs test. On the field, Smith guided the club to the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a>, but league form was inconsistent and Palace once again found themselves relegated, finishing fourth from bottom as the Premier League was reduced from 22 to 20 clubs.
Smith left the club and Steve Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, and through a combination of the first-team coaching of <a href="Ray%20Lewington">Ray Lewington</a> and latterly <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett's</a> managership, Palace reached the play-offs. They lost the <a href="1996%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">1996 First Division play-off final</a> in dramatic fashion when <a href="Steve%20Claridge">Steve Claridge</a> scored in the last minute of extra-time for <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> to win 2–1. The following season saw Coppell take charge as first-team manager when Bassett departed for <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in early 1997. The club reached the play-offs for the second year running and this time achieved promotion back to the Premier League, when they defeated <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> 1–0 in the <a href="1997%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">final</a> at Wembley.
Their stay in the Premier League was no more successful than the previous two, and in true <a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo club</a> fashion Palace were relegated back to the First Division at the end of the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a> season. The club also had a new owner when recruitment tycoon <a href="Mark%20Goldberg%20%28football%20manager%29">Mark Goldberg</a> completed his takeover in June 1998.
Financial crisis (1998–2010).
Terry Venables returned to Palace for a second spell as manager and the club competed in European competition during the summer when they played in the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a>. Palace then went into <a href="Administration%20%28insolvency%29">administration</a> in 1999, when owner Mark Goldberg was unable to sustain his financial backing of the club. Venables left and Steve Coppell took over again as manager. The club emerged from administration under the ownership of <a href="Simon%20Jordan">Simon Jordan</a>, and Coppell was replaced as manager by Alan Smith for a second time. Palace were almost relegated to the third tier in Jordan's first season, in <a href="2000-01%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a>. Smith was sacked in April and long-serving coach <a href="Steve%20Kember">Steve Kember</a> took over as caretaker manager and he managed to win the two remaining fixtures that would guarantee Palace survival, with <a href="Dougie%20Freedman">Dougie Freedman</a> scoring the winner in the 87th minute on the final day of the season, securing a 1–0 victory over <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a>. Former Manchester United captain <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> was appointed manager for the <a href="2001-02%20in%20English%20football">2001–02</a> season. A good start to the season gave Palace hope for a promotion challenge, but Bruce attempted to walk out on the club after just four months in charge following an approach from <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> to become their new manager. After a short spell on <a href="Garden%20leave">gardening leave</a>, Bruce was eventually allowed to join Birmingham, and was succeeded by <a href="Trevor%20Francis">Trevor Francis</a>, who had been his predecessor at the West Midlands club.
Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, but he was then sacked, and replaced by Steve Kember, who became permanent manager. The club won their opening three games of the <a href="2003-04%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> season under Kember, which put them at the top of the table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw Palace slip towards the relegation zone. Former Palace striker <a href="Iain%20Dowie">Iain Dowie</a> was appointed manager and guided the club to the <a href="2004%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a>, securing promotion with a 1–0 victory over <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham</a>. Again Palace could not maintain their place in the top tier and were relegated on the last day of the season after drawing at local rivals <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>.
Following that relegation, Simon Jordan was unable to put the club on a sound financial footing over the next few years, and in January 2010, Palace were once again placed in administration, this time by a creditor. Due to the Football League's regulations, the club were deducted ten points, and the administrators were forced to sell key players including <a href="Victor%20Moses">Victor Moses</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Fonte">José Fonte</a>. <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a> had also departed as manager in the early part of 2010. He had been appointed in 2007, replacing the former Palace favourite <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%20born%201953%29">Peter Taylor</a> who had a brief spell as manager. <a href="Paul%20Hart">Paul Hart</a> took over as caretaker manager for the final weeks of the season. Survival in <a href="EFL%20Championship">the Championship</a> was only secured on the final day of the season after a memorable 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday, which was itself relegated as a result.
During the close of that season, CPFC 2010, a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans, successfully negotiated the purchase of the club. They were led by <a href="Steve%20Parish%20%28businessman%29">Steve Parish</a>, the vocal representative for the consortium of four that also included Stephen Browett, <a href="Jeremy%20Hosking">Jeremy Hosking</a> and <a href="Martin%20Long%20%28businessman%29">Martin Long</a>. Crucially, the consortium also secured the freehold of Selhurst Park, and paid tribute to a fans' campaign which helped pressure <a href="Lloyds%20Banking%20Group">Lloyds Bank</a> into selling the ground back to the club.
Established back in the Premier League (2010–present).
The CPFC 2010 consortium swiftly installed <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a> as the new Palace manager. However a poor start to the following season saw the club hovering around the bottom of the table by December. On 1 January 2011, after a 0–3 defeat to <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>, Burley was sacked and his assistant Dougie Freedman named caretaker manager. Just over a week later Freedman was appointed manager on a full-time basis. Palace moved up the table and by securing a 1–1 draw at <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> on 30 April, the club was safe from relegation with one game of the season left. After another year and a half as manager, Freedman departed to manage <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> on 23 October 2012.
In November 2012, <a href="Ian%20Holloway">Ian Holloway</a> became the new Palace manager. He guided the club back to the Premier League after an eight-year absence by defeating Watford 1–0 in the Championship <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a> at the <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">new Wembley</a>, but resigned in October 2013. Following a brief spell under <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a>, and an unsuccessful second tenure for Neil Warnock, former Palace player <a href="Alan%20Pardew">Alan Pardew</a> was confirmed as the new manager in January 2015. In his first full season, Pardew led the club to the <a href="2016%20FA%20Cup%20final">2016 FA Cup final</a>, their first for 26 years. Palace met Manchester United who they had lost to in the 1990 final, and the Eagles suffered disappointment again losing 1–2 after extra-time. In December 2016, Pardew was sacked and replaced by <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a>, who kept the club in the Premier League, but resigned unexpectedly at the end of the season. On 26 June 2017, Palace appointed <a href="Frank%20de%20Boer">Frank de Boer</a> as their first ever permanent foreign manager. He was dismissed after only 77 days in charge, with the club having lost their first four league games at the start of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.%20season">2017–18</a> season while failing to score in any of them. Former England manager <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a> was appointed as the club's new manager the next day. Palace finished in eleventh-place in the Premier League in Hodgson's first season, twelfth in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.%20season">2018–19</a> season and fourteenth the following season.
On 18 May 2021, the club announced Hodgson would be leaving at the end of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.%20season">2020–21</a> season, upon the expiration of his contract, having achieved a second consecutive fourteenth-place finish in his last season at the club. On 4 July 2021, Palace appointed the former <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> captain <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a> as their new manager on a three-year contract. Despite guiding the club to an FA Cup semi-final and a twelfth-place league finish in his first season, Vieira was sacked the following season on 17 March 2023, after a winless run of 12 games left the club three points above the relegation zone.
On 21 March 2023, Hodgson was re-appointed Palace manager until the end of the season. He guided the club to safety, finishing comfortably in eleventh place at the end of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.%20season">2022–23</a> season. On 3 July, Hodgson was appointed permanent manager for a second time, though he stepped down from the role prematurely on 19 February 2024. He was replaced by Austrian manager <a href="Oliver%20Glasner">Oliver Glasner</a>.
Colours and crest.
The original amateur club wore blue and white hooped shirts with blue shorts, although there were variations on this, it is thought their first ever kit in 1861 was light blue and white halves. When the professional Crystal Palace club was created in 1905, its choice of colours were originally claret and blue shirts paired with white shorts and socks tending to be claret. This was a result of the important role in the club's formation played by <a href="Edmund%20Goodman">Edmund Goodman</a>, an <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> employee who later became Palace manager. The club kept to this formula fairly consistently until 1938, when they decided to abandon the claret and blue and adopt white shirts and black shorts with matching socks. They returned to claret and blue from 1949 to 1954, but in 1955 the club reverted to white and black, using claret and blue trim.
There were variations on this theme until 1963, when the club adopted the away strip of yellow shirts as its home colours. In 1964, the club changed to an all-white strip modelled on <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> whom Palace had played recently in a friendly, before they returned to claret and blue jerseys with white shorts in 1966. The club continued with variations on this theme up until <a href="Malcolm%20Allison">Malcolm Allison's</a> arrival as manager in 1973. Allison overhauled the club's image, adopting red and blue vertical stripes for colours and kit, inspired by <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>. Palace have played in variations of red and blue ever since, bar the centenary season of 2005 which saw them wear a version of their 1971–72 claret, blue and white kit.
The club was relatively late in establishing a crest. Although the initials were embroidered on the shirt from the 1935–36 season, a crest featuring the façade of The Crystal Palace did not appear until 1955. This crest disappeared from the shirt in 1964, and the team's name appeared embroidered on shirts, between 1967 and 1972. A round badge was then adopted in 1972, with the club's initials and nickname the "Glaziers" before Allison changed this too. The club's nickname became the "Eagles", inspired by Portuguese club <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>, with the badge showing the image of an eagle holding a ball. This emblem remained until 1987 when the club married the eagle with the Crystal Palace façade, and although updated in 1996 and again in 2012, the crest retains these features. In June 2022, the club changed the year of its crest from 1905 to 1861, reflecting when the <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.%20%281861%29">original Crystal Palace Football Club</a> was established.
From mid-2010 to 2020, the club made use of an <a href="American%20bald%20eagle">American bald eagle</a>, called Kayla, as the club <a href="mascot">mascot</a>, with the bird flying from one end of the stadium to the other at every home game. The bird died in June 2020.

Stadium.
In 1905, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre%23Football">FA Cup final</a> venue situated inside the grounds of The Crystal Palace, wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. They formed a new professional Crystal Palace football club to play at the stadium. When the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> broke out, the Palace and grounds were seized by the armed forces, and in 1915 the club were forced to move by the <a href="British%20Admiralty">Admiralty</a>. They found a temporary base at the <a href="Herne%20Hill%20Velodrome">Herne Hill Velodrome</a>. Although other clubs offered the use of their grounds to Palace, the club felt it best to remain as close to their natural catchment area as possible. When <a href="Croydon%20Common%20F.C.">Croydon Common F.C.</a> were wound up in 1917, the club took over their old stadium located at <a href="Croydon%20Common%20Athletic%20Ground">the Nest</a>. In 1919, they began the purchase of the land on which they would eventually build <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a>, their current home.
The renowned stadium architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> was employed to draw up plans, and the construction of Selhurst Park was completed in time for the <a href="1924-25%20in%20English%20football">1924–25</a> season. The stadium remained relatively unchanged, with only the introduction of floodlights and some maintenance improvements until 1969, when the Arthur Wait Stand was built. The Main Stand became all-seater in 1979 and more work followed in the early 1980s when the Whitehorse Lane End was redeveloped to allow for a <a href="Sainsbury%27s">Sainsbury's</a> supermarket, club offices and a club shop. The Arthur Wait Stand became all-seater in 1990, and in 1994 the Holmesdale Terrace was replaced with a new two tier stand. Selhurst Park's record attendance was set in 1979, with an official total of 51,482. After all the redevelopments to the ground and safety requirements due to the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>, the ground's current capacity is 25,486. In 2011, proposals were put forward to move the club back to their original home at the Crystal Palace National Stadium, but after the club gained promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 2013, there has been a renewed focus on redeveloping Selhurst Park into a 40,000 seater stadium.
Revised plans for a new 13,500-seater Main Stand (extending overall stadium capacity to 34,000) were approved at a Croydon Council meeting on 19 April 2018.
Supporters.
Crystal Palace have a fan base predominantly from the local area which draws on <a href="South%20London">South London</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, and <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. Their original home at The Crystal Palace was on the boundary with Kent, while Selhurst Park was within Surrey's borders until the <a href="London%20Government%20Act%201963">London Government Act 1963</a> saw <a href="Greater%20London">Greater London</a> encompass <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a>. The club's passionate support at home games emanates from the Holmesdale Road Stand, in which the ultras group the <a href="Holmesdale%20Fanatics">Holmesdale Fanatics</a> have been based since 2005.
The fans have established at least two other supporters groups. The Palace Independent Supporters' Association was set up to raise supporter concerns with the club, while the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust was originally established to enable fans to purchase the club during the <a href="Administration%20%28insolvency%29">administration</a> of 2000 and remained in existence up to the end of 2023.
A number of <a href="fanzines">fanzines</a> have been produced by the supporters over the years. "Eagle Eye" was launched in 1987 and ran until 1994, with a number of contributors producing the replacement "Palace Echo" in 1995, which continued until 2007. "The Eastern Eagles", "So Glad You're Mine" and "One More Point" were also published by fans in the 1990s. When "One More Point" ceased publication, "Five Year Plan" was launched in its place, and maintains an online presence. Supporters also engage in debate on two <a href="internet%20forum">internet forum</a>s, The BBS and Holmesdale.net which the club use as channels to communicate with the fans.
Because Crystal Palace are a London club, they compete against a number of other local clubs for the attention of supporters, but it does have a recognisably large catchment area of 900,000. When the new owners took control in 2010, they sought the fans' input into future decisions. They consulted on a new badge design, and when their chosen designs were rejected, the club instead opted for a design based on a fans' idea from an internet forum. The club have strengthened their ties with the local community, and through the Crystal Palace F.C. Foundation, they work with the local London Boroughs of Croydon, Bromley and Sutton to provide sports and educational programmes which they also hope will continue to develop their supporter and geographical base. The Foundation's work was recognised by the Football League in August 2009 with their Silver Standard Community Scheme Award.
The club also enjoys a sizeable celebrity support. <a href="Kevin%20Day">Kevin Day</a> and <a href="Jo%20Brand">Jo Brand</a> host an annual comedy night for <a href="Comic%20Relief">Comic Relief</a> and the Palace Academy, and fellow comedians <a href="Eddie%20Izzard">Eddie Izzard</a> and <a href="Mark%20Steel">Mark Steel</a> are also staunch Palace fans. The actor <a href="Neil%20Morrissey">Neil Morrissey</a> developed Palace Ale, a beer on sale in the ground, while fellow actor <a href="Bill%20Nighy">Bill Nighy</a> is patron of the Crystal Palace Children's Charity (CPSCC). Radio DJ <a href="David%20Jensen">David Jensen</a> is chairman of the Crystal Palace Vice Presidents Club, and acted as spokesman for the CPFC 2010 consortium during their takeover bid for the club. Actor, writer and producer <a href="John%20Salthouse">John Salthouse</a> was on the books of Palace as a player from 1968 to 1970 under the name of John Lewis, and was also a mascot for the club as a child. He incorporated the club into his role as Tony in <a href="Abigail%27s%20Party">Abigail's Party</a>. The television presenter <a href="Susanna%20Reid">Susanna Reid</a> revealed her love of Palace while taking part in "<a href="Strictly%20Come%20Dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a>", and visited Selhurst Park for inspiration.
Rivalries.
Due to their location in the capital, Crystal Palace are involved in a number of local derbies, mostly across <a href="South%20London%20derby">South London</a>. They enjoy rivalries with both <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> and former tenants <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>. The club have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a> which developed after Palace's relegation to the Third Division in 1974, reaching its height when the two teams were drawn together in the first round of the 1976–77 FA Cup. The tie went to two replays, but the second replay ended in controversy after referee <a href="Ron%20Challis">Ron Challis</a> ordered a successful Brighton penalty to be retaken because of reported encroachment by a Brighton player - other sources also claim that this was due to contact from a Crystal Palace player. The retake was saved, Palace won the tie 1–0 and a fierce rivalry was born.
Ownership.
The Crystal Palace Company formed both the amateur and professional clubs. The first chairman of the professional Crystal Palace club was <a href="Sydney%20Bourne">Sydney Bourne</a> who was found by club secretary <a href="Edmund%20Goodman">Edmund Goodman</a> after he had examined records of FA Cup final ticket purchasers. Goodman noted his name as one that had bought a number of tickets every year, and so met with Bourne and found him very agreeable to the idea of the new club. Bourne was invited onto the board of directors and elected chairman at the club's first ever meeting. He remained chairman until his death in 1930.
After Bourne's death, there were a number of short-term chairmanship appointments: Louis Bellatti (1930–1935), R.S. Flew (1935), Carey Burnett (1935–36), E.T. Truett (1936–1939), before Percy Harper's reign (1939–1950). Local builder <a href="Arthur%20Wait">Arthur Wait</a> established a consortium of seven other businessmen to purchase the club in 1949, and took over from Harper in 1950, initially rotating the chairmanship. In 1958, Wait became the permanent chairman, lasting until 1972 when Raymond Bloye took over. Bloye's ownership lasted until 26 January 1981, when property developer <a href="Ron%20Noades">Ron Noades</a> and his consortium took control of the club. Noades eventually sold the club to <a href="Mark%20Goldberg%20%28football%20manager%29">Mark Goldberg</a> on 5 June 1998, becoming the second-longest serving Palace chairman behind Sydney Bourne. However, Noades did maintain ownership of <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a>, leasing it to the club to use. Goldberg's tenure of the club was not a success and Palace entered administration in March 1999. Although the fans established a group called the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust in a bid to gain control of the club, millionaire and lifelong fan <a href="Simon%20Jordan">Simon Jordan</a> negotiated a deal with creditors and the administrator, and a new company, CPFC 2000 took control. This company entered administration in January 2010, and it was not until June of that year that a takeover was completed by a consortium of four wealthy fans known as CPFC 2010.
CPFC 2010 was established by a consortium of four businessmen, <a href="Steve%20Parish%20%28businessman%29">Steve Parish</a>, <a href="Martin%20Long%20%28businessman%29">Martin Long</a>, Stephen Browett and <a href="Jeremy%20Hosking">Jeremy Hosking</a>, with each owning a 25% share of the company. The four successfully negotiated a takeover with the administrator Brendan Guilfoyle from the P&A Partnership and a <a href="company%20voluntary%20arrangement">company voluntary arrangement</a> was formally accepted by company creditors on 20 August 2010. The consortium also purchased back Selhurst Park from <a href="Lloyds%20Banking%20Group">Lloyds Bank</a> after a demonstration by fans put pressure on the bank to agree terms.
In December 2015, American investors <a href="Josh%20Harris%20%28businessman%29">Josh Harris</a> and <a href="David%20Blitzer">David Blitzer</a> each bought a 18% stake in the club as <a href="general%20partner">general partner</a>s for a total of £50 million. In August 2021, another American investor <a href="John%20Textor">John Textor</a> bought a 45% stake worth £87.5 million, with Parish remaining as chairman with full control of the club despite holding around 10% equity. Robert Franco and other investors own the remaining 9%.

The club's highest ever league finish so far is third place in the old Football League First Division, which is now called the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, achieved in the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Football%20League">1990–91</a> season. Palace hold the record for the most points for a relegated Premier League club with 49 (although that was in a 42-game season in <a href="1992-93%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a>). They are also the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League, even though they finished fourth from bottom, as it had been decided at the end of the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95</a> season, that the bottom four clubs would be relegated in order to accommodate the league being reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20FA%20Premier%20League">1995–96</a> season; Palace's points total that season of 45 is also the second-highest points total in Premier League history for a relegated club. Palace hold the record for the most play-off final wins (4) resulting in promotion to the top flight. Each of these play-off final wins occurred at a different location: Selhurst Park in 1989 (the first leg of the two-legged final was played at <a href="Ewood%20Park">Ewood Park</a> in <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a>), <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">old Wembley Stadium</a> in 1997, <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> in 2004, and <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">new Wembley</a> in 2013.

Aston Villa Football Club, commonly referred to as Villa, is a professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Aston">Aston</a>, <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="England">England</a>. The club, founded in 1874, competes in the , the top tier of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. The team have played at their home ground <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a> since <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20Aston%20Villa%20F.C.%20season">1897</a>. Aston Villa is one of the oldest and most successful clubs in England, having won the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Football League First Division</a> seven times, the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> seven times, the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> five times, and the <a href="European%20Cup">European Cup</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">European Super Cup</a> once.
Aston Villa has been a leading English club since the 1880s, when its team were pioneers of the modern passing game. This short, quick combination passing style was introduced by Scotsman <a href="George%20Ramsay%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201855%29">George Ramsay</a>, who was appointed as the world's first professional football manager in 1886. The club was influential in the sport's move to professionalism in 1885, and it was a Villa director, <a href="William%20McGregor%20%28football%29">William McGregor</a>, who founded the world's first Football League <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Aston%20Villa%20F.C.%20season">in 1888</a>.
George Ramsay's trophy haul of six League Championships and six FA Cups established Aston Villa as the most successful club in England, a position it held from the 1890s until the 1970s. Villa scored 128 goals in <a href="1930-31%20avfc">season 1930–31</a>, which remains the all-time top-flight record, however the club began its first decline in the mid-1930s; the 1940s and 1950s were generally a period of mediocrity followed by a steep decline in the 1960s which culminated in a takeover of the club by <a href="Doug%20Ellis">Doug Ellis</a> in 1968 and Villa's first and only relegation to the third tier of English football in 1969–70. Villa returned to the elite from the mid-1970s under manager <a href="Ron%20Saunders">Ron Saunders</a>, who led the club to a seventh top-flight league title in 1980–81. They became only the fourth English club to win the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>, in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20European%20Cup">1981–82</a>, followed by the <a href="European%20Super%20Cup">European Super Cup</a> in <a href="1982%20European%20Super%20Cup">1982</a>.
Aston Villa was a founding member of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Aston%20Villa%20F.C.%20season">in 1992</a>, one of just three clubs to have been founding members of both the Football League and the Premier League. The club regularly qualified for European football in the 1990s, but following a period in which the club struggled to compete with the high levels of spending of the leading clubs, Doug Ellis sold his stake in the club to American billionaire <a href="Randy%20Lerner">Randy Lerner</a>, whose ownership of the club ended with Villa's first and only relegation from the Premier League in season 2015–16. The club returned to the Premier League in 2019.
During its history Villa has spent 110 seasons in the top-flight, the second highest of any club, and provided 76 England internationals, also the second highest of any club. Aston Villa is currently ranked 5th in the all-time English top flight table, since its creation in <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Football%20League">1888</a> and is the <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20England%20by%20competitive%20honours%20won">seventh most successful club</a> in English football by competitive honours.

History.
Formation and rise to prominence (1874−1886).
Aston Villa Football Club were formed <a href="1873-74%20in%20English%20football">in March 1874</a>, by members of the Villa Cross <a href="John%20Wesley">Wesleyan</a> Chapel in <a href="Handsworth%2C%20West%20Midlands">Handsworth</a> which is now part of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood, who were members of the chapel's cricket team looking for a way to stay fit during the winter months. Due to the lack of local football teams Aston Villa's first match was against the local <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Aston%20Brook">Aston Brook St Mary's</a> <a href="Rugby%20football">Rugby</a> team. As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules. Villa won their first game 1–0.
The infant club's fortunes changed forever when a young Scotsman called <a href="George%20Ramsay%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201855%29">George Ramsay</a> stumbled across the Villa players' practice match in <a href="Aston%20Park%2C%20Birmingham">Aston Park</a> in 1876. He was asked to make up the numbers and they were amazed by his skills, they had never seen such a display of close ball control before. When the game was over, the Villa players surrounded him and invited him to join the club and become their captain. Word spread about how fine a player Ramsay was, spectators began turning up to watch the little man nicknamed ‘Scotty’. He also took charge of training, Ramsay later described the newly formed club's approach to the game as 'a dash at the man and a big kick at the ball'. Ramsay was influenced by the Scottish club, <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20FC">Queen's Park</a>, who pioneered what became known as 'combination football' in his native <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, the intricate passing game he introduced was a revolutionary move for an English club in the late 1870s.
Villa began to establish themselves as one of the best teams in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the <a href="Birmingham%20Senior%20Cup">Birmingham Senior Cup</a> <a href="1879%E2%80%9380%20AVFC%20season">in 1880</a>. The club would go on to lift the trophy 9 times in the next 12 seasons.
Victorian and Edwardian golden age (1886–1914).
Following the professionalisation of football in 1885, the club decided that it needed a full-time paid manager. The following advert was placed in the <a href="Birmingham%20Gazette">Birmingham Daily Gazette</a> newspaper in June 1886:
 Villa received 150 applicants for the role, but with his strong association with the club George Ramsay was the overwhelming choice of the membership. Thus on 26 June 1886, Aston Villa appointed what has been described as the world's first professional football manager. 
The following season Aston Villa rose to national prominence, as the first Midlands team to win the FA Cup in 1887. Villa's captain, the powerful Scottish centre-forward <a href="Archie%20Hunter">Archie Hunter</a> became one of the game's first household names, being the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup. Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1888 with one of the club's directors, <a href="William%20McGregor%20%28football%29">William McGregor</a> being the league's founder. Following the professionalisation of football in 1885, clubs needed regular income to pay their players' wages. Frequently <a href="Exhibition%20match">friendlies</a> were cancelled due to opponents' FA Cup or <a href="county%20cup">county cup</a> matches or clubs simply failed to honour a fixture in favour of a more lucrative match elsewhere. McGregor took action after seeing Villa matches cancelled, to the increasing frustration of the club's fans, on five consecutive Saturdays. In March 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>, <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> and <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion">West Bromwich Albion</a>, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. Following two meetings between representatives of the leading clubs, the world's first Football League season began in September 1888 with 12 member clubs from the Midlands and north of England: <a href="Accrington%20Stanley">Accrington</a>, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, <a href="Burnley%20FC">Burnley</a>, <a href="Derby%20County">Derby County</a>, <a href="Everton%20FC">Everton</a>, <a href="Notts%20County">Notts County</a>, Preston North End, <a href="Stoke%20City">Stoke</a>, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers.
Despite Villa founding the league, by 1893 they had yet to win it. Villa Committee Member <a href="Frederick%20Rinder">Frederick Rinder</a> was the instigator of a club meeting at Barwick Street in February 1893 that removed the committee running the club at the time. All fourteen committee members resigned and were replaced by a committee of five led by Rinder after he gave a rousing speech criticising the board's tolerance of ill discipline and players' drinking. On the pitch, manager <a href="George%20Ramsay%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201855%29">George Ramsay</a> was moulding a team that became renowned for its short, quick combination passing which saw Villa win its first league title in <a href="1893-94%20Football%20League">1893–94</a>; the season after that the club won its second FA Cup in <a href="1895%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1894-95</a>. This was followed by back-to-back League titles in <a href="1895-96%20Football%20League">1895–96</a> and <a href="1896-97%20Football%20League">1896–97</a>.
Aston Villa emerged as the most successful English club of the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>, winning no fewer than five League titles and three FA Cups by the end of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s reign in 1901. Villa's captain during this era was Birmingham-born forward <a href="John%20Devey">John Devey</a>, who enjoyed a successful partnership with the lightning-fast winger <a href="Charlie%20Athersmith">Charlie Athersmith</a> and marshalling Villa's defence was the tough-tackling Scotsman <a href="James%20Cowan%20%28footballer%29">James Cowan</a>, who had an unrivalled sense of timing and anticipation. <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20Aston%20Villa%20F.C.%20season">In 1897</a>, the year Villa won <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">The Double</a>, they moved into their present home, the Aston Lower Grounds. Supporters coined the name "Villa Park"; no official declaration listed the ground as <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a>.
Success continued into the <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian era</a>, with Villa lifting the FA Cup for the fourth time in <a href="1905%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1904–05</a>, and a sixth league title in <a href="1909%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League">1909–10</a>. A further FA Cup triumph was achieved on the eve of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1913, with the club narrowly missing out on winning a second <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">Double</a>, finishing runners-up in the league. Star-players during this era included <a href="Howard%20Spencer">Howard Spencer</a>, the cultured defender who captained both Villa and England, and the prolific strike force of <a href="Joe%20Bache">Joe Bache</a> and <a href="Harry%20Hampton%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201885%29">Harry Hampton</a> who between them scored 382 goals in claret and blue.
Relative decline and first relegation (1920–1939).
In January 1920, <a href="Billy%20Walker%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201897%29">Billy Walker</a> scored twice on his Villa debut in a 2–1 FA Cup first-round win over <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers">QPR</a>; the club won the FA Cup for the sixth time that season and Walker went on to establish himself as Villa's star player of the 1920s, scoring a record 244 goals in 531 appearances, captaining Villa and <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>. <a href="George%20Ramsay%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201855%29">George Ramsay</a> retired in 1926, at the age of 71, his replacement <a href="W.%20J.%20Smith">Billy Smith</a> was unable to continue Ramsay's success, in reality several other football clubs had caught up with Aston Villa, most notably <a href="Arsenal%20FC">Arsenal</a>, who the club finished runners-up to in the league in <a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20Football%20League">1930–31</a> and <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20Football%20League">1932–33</a>. Despite missing out on the league title, Villa Park crowds were entertained by attacking football, the 128 goals scored in 1930–31, remains the all-time top-flight record to the present day. A remarkable 49 of the league goals that season were scored by centre-forward <a href="Tom%20%27Pongo%27%20Waring">Tom 'Pongo' Waring</a>, with another 30 goals from winger <a href="Eric%20Houghton">Eric Houghton</a>.
The club appointed <a href="Jimmy%20McMullan">Jimmy McMullan</a> as manager in 1934, however, the move proved disastrous, resulting in Villa's first ever relegation in 1935–36 after 48 years in the top flight. Villa struggled largely due to a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal's</a> <a href="Ted%20Drake">Ted Drake</a> in an <a href="Aston%20Villa%201%E2%80%937%20Arsenal%20%2814%20December%201935%29">infamous 1–7 defeat</a> at Villa Park. The club made seven signings and spent a staggering sum for the time of £35,500 trying to retain top-flight status at all costs, but were unable to buy their way out of trouble. Aston Villa, at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, was relegated in 1936 for the first time in its history.
Following relegation to the Second Division, the Villa board brought back the ageing former club chairman <a href="Frederick%20Rinder">Fred Rinder</a>, who said on his return "Villa have been a great club, are still a great club, and always will be a great club". He was vocal in his criticism of the board for its "almost total neglect of the reserve team, instead relying on paying big fees for ready made players". He believed that this change in policy from scouting and developing young homegrown talent led to a decline in the club's culture and style of play, which alongside a tolerance of ill-discipline in the players led to Villa's relegation. Rinder's first act was to travel to Austria to recruit the progressive coach <a href="Jimmy%20Hogan">Jimmy Hogan</a> as manager. Within two seasons, Hogan had guided Villa back to the top flight as Second Division champions playing attractive free-flowing football. Hogan outlined his philosophy: "I am a teacher and lover of constructive football with every pass, every kick, every movement an object." He used to tell his players that "football was like a <a href="Viennese%20waltz">Viennese waltz</a>, a rhapsody. one-two-three, one-two-three, pass-move-pass, pass-move-pass.". Unfortunately, the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> ended Hogan's project to restore Aston Villa to the top of the English game.
Mediocrity and discontent (1945–1961).
Like all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end. Bumper crowds flocked to Villa Park following the war, 76,588 people attended the FA Cup quarter-final between Villa and <a href="Derby%20County">Derby County</a> in March 1946, which is the all-time record attendance at Villa Park. The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player <a href="Alex%20Massie%20%28footballer%29">Alex Massie</a> for the remainder of the 1940s. Star players of this era included the one-club man <a href="Harry%20Parkes%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201920%29">Harry Parkes</a>, the Welsh centre forward <a href="Trevor%20Ford">Trevor Ford</a> and inside-forward <a href="Johnny%20Dixon%20%28footballer%29">Johnny Dixon</a>, however the club only achieved mid-table finishes throughout the forties and fifties, never finishing higher than 6th place in the league. The board came in for increasing criticism during this time, with the 1953 AGM described by the <a href="Sports%20Argus">Sports Argus</a> as "the longest and liveliest Villa meeting". Shareholders and supporters criticised the club's lack of youth development, recruitment and training methods. When <a href="Danny%20Blanchflower">Danny Blanchflower</a> put in a transfer request in 1954 he said that "the club had grown fat and lazy on its old traditions and the decay was eating at the once solid foundations".
Despite narrowly avoiding relegation the season before, Aston Villa's first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956–57 season when another former Villa player, <a href="Eric%20Houghton">Eric Houghton</a> led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the 'Busby Babes' of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> 2–1 with Northern Irish winger <a href="Peter%20McParland">Peter McParland</a> scoring both goals. The team continued to struggle for consistency in the league though, which led to Eric Houghton being sacked in December 1958. His replacement <a href="Joe%20Mercer">Joe Mercer</a> could not prevent the club being relegated for only the second time in their history in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Football%20League">1958-59</a>. However, under the stewardship of Mercer, Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions with a talented young side which became known as 'Mercer's Minors'. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> with England centre-forward <a href="Gerry%20Hitchens">Gerry Hitchens</a> scoring an impressive 42 goals in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Football%20League">1960-61</a>.
Deep malaise and revival (1961–1974).
Hitchens' goals brought him to the attention of Italian club <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a>, who offered him a large financial incentive to sign. He was sold for £85,000 in summer of 1961, his replacement, <a href="Derek%20Dougan">Derek Dougan</a> was not a success and Villa slid backwards. Mercer's forced retirement from the club in July 1964, following a stress-induced stroke, signalled a period of deep turmoil and malaise. The most successful club in England had failed to keep pace with changes in the modern game; three of the five-man board of directors were over 70 years old, the club had neglected its scouting network and coaching structure and the club's finances were in a parlous state. This led to the club selling its top striker <a href="Tony%20Hateley">Tony Hateley</a> to <a href="Chelsea%20FC">Chelsea</a> for £100,000 in October 1966, without his goals Villa were relegated for the third time in its history, under manager <a href="Dick%20Taylor%20%28football%20manager%29">Dick Taylor</a> in 1967. The board even sold the club's training ground outside Villa Park for housing, leaving the team in the position of training on borrowed training pitches of local factory teams.
The following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished 16th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked <a href="Tommy%20Cummings">Tommy Cummings</a> (the manager brought in to replace Taylor), and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans. After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who brought in <a href="Doug%20Ellis">Doug Ellis</a> as chairman in December 1968. Ellis later recalled that "you could write your name in the dust, window frames were rotting, the smell of failure and imminent financial ruin hung in the air"; one of their first acts was to raise £205,835 in a share issue which cleared the club's debts. Doug Ellis's first managerial appointment was the outspoken Scottish manager <a href="Tommy%20Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a>, who after initial success, was sacked after 13 months in charge with the club at the foot of Second Division. His replacement was former club captain and reserve team manager <a href="Vic%20Crowe">Vic Crowe</a>, who could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time in its history at the end of the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20in%20English%20football">1969–70</a> season.
The following season Villa surprised everyone by beating <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a> in the two-legged semi-final to reach the <a href="1971%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1971 League Cup Final</a>, in which the team played well but were defeated by two late <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> goals. There was a renewed sense of optimism at Villa Park as the club was promoted to the Second Division as champions with average attendances of 30,000 and a record 70 points in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20in%20English%20football">1971–72 season</a>. Off the pitch, the board purchased the new 20-acre <a href="Bodymoor%20Heath%20Training%20Ground">Bodymoor Heath Training Ground</a> in December 1971, with a view to improving the club's youth development and coaching facilities.
Back among the elite (1974–1992).
Following a 14th-place finish in the Second Division, Crowe was replaced in August 1974 by <a href="Ron%20Saunders">Ron Saunders</a>. He was a fitness fanatic, whose brand of no-nonsense man-management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, by the end of season 1974–75, he had taken Aston Villa back into the First Division and into Europe. One player who had been a mainstay of the Villa team throughout the rollercoaster of relegations and subsequent revival was fan-favourite <a href="Charlie%20Aitken%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201942%29">Charlie Aitkin</a>, who made 659 appearances at <a href="left%20back">left back</a> for the club between 1959 and 1976, making him Villa's all-time record appearance holder.
Aston Villa were back among the elite as Saunders continued to mould a winning team, finishing 4th in the league and winning a further League Cup in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77</a>, with the formidable strike partnership of <a href="Brian%20Little">Brian Little</a> and <a href="Andy%20Gray%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201955%29">Andy Gray</a>, who became the first player to win both the <a href="PFA%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Young Player of the Year</a> and <a href="PFA%20Players%27%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Players' Player of the Year</a> in the same season.
The 1970s was an era of boardroom unrest at Villa Park. Ron Saunders had a strained relationship with <a href="Doug%20Ellis">Doug Ellis</a>, resenting Doug's perceived interference in football matters. Over time Ellis became an isolated figure on the board, as the other directors sided with Saunders. He was ousted as chairman in 1975 to make way for <a href="Sir%20William%20Dugdale%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Sir William Dugdale</a>. He remained on the board until 1979, when he left the club after a protracted power struggle with majority shareholder <a href="Ron%20Bendall">Ron Bendall</a>. With Ellis gone, Saunders became all-powerful as manager.
Villa achieved a seventh top-flight league title in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20in%20English%20football">1980–81</a>, with players such as <a href="Gordon%20Cowans">Gordon Cowans</a>, <a href="Tony%20Morley">Tony Morley</a> and captain <a href="Dennis%20Mortimer">Dennis Mortimer</a> leading the club to its first top-flight title in 71 years. Remarkably, they did so using just 14 players, with seven players being ever-presents. Villa's Birmingham-born forward <a href="Gary%20Shaw%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201961%29">Gary Shaw</a> was named 1980-1981 <a href="PFA%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Young Player of the Year</a>.
To the surprise of commentators and fans, Ron Saunders quit halfway through the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20in%20English%20football">1981–82</a> season, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. Saunders had expressed his exasperation with the board at the lack of funds available to him to strengthen the team and fell out with the chairman Ron Bendall over the terms of his contract. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager <a href="Tony%20Barton%20%28footballer%29">Tony Barton</a> who guided the club to a 1–0 victory over <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the <a href="1982%20European%20Cup%20Final">European Cup final</a> in <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> courtesy of a <a href="Peter%20Withe">Peter Withe</a> goal in the 67th minute. Ten minutes into the final, Villa's first choice goalkeeper, <a href="Jimmy%20Rimmer">Jimmy Rimmer</a>, was injured and young substitute keeper <a href="Nigel%20Spink">Nigel Spink</a> was called into action, having only made one previous appearance in the first team. Spink performed superbly, keeping a clean sheet, and helping Villa become only the fourth English club to lift the European Cup. 
The following season the defence of the European Cup ended in a quarter-final defeat to <a href="Juventus">Juventus</a>, but Villa won the <a href="1982%20European%20Super%20Cup">European Super Cup</a>, beating <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> 3–1 on aggregate. This marked a pinnacle though and Villa's fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s. Doug Ellis returned as chairman and majority shareholder in November 1982. The club was saddled with significant debts and questions had been raised by the police regarding fraudulent financial activity surrounding the building of the North Stand at Villa Park from 1980 to 1982. The cost of the work was £1.3 million. An internal investigation found that £700,000 of the £1.3 million worth of bills were unaccounted for. A later report by accountants <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a> found that there were "serious breaches of recommended codes of practice and poor site supervision". Ellis immediately set about trying to reduce the club's overheads. He informed the players that they needed to take pay cuts and told the manager Tony Barton that there was a need to reduce the playing staff. Saunders' team was broken up and not adequately replaced, culminating in the club being relegated in 1987, just five years after Villa had been crowned European champions.
However, Villa bounced back quickly, achieving promotion the following year under <a href="Graham%20Taylor%20%28footballer%29">Graham Taylor</a> and a runners-up position in the top-flight in the 1989–90 season with a fine side that included <a href="Paul%20McGrath%20%28footballer%29">Paul McGrath</a>, <a href="Tony%20Daley">Tony Daley</a> and <a href="David%20Platt%20%28footballer%29">David Platt</a>. Following this success, Graham Taylor accepted the offer to take over as England manager in 1990.
24 years in the Premier League (1992–2016).
Villa were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, one of just three clubs to have been founding members of both the Football League in 1888 and the Premier League, along with <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers">Blackburn Rovers</a> and <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. Villa finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season under the charismatic manager <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a>. His side lifted the League Cup in 1994, beating Manchester United 3–1 in the final, with goals from <a href="Dalian%20Atkinson">Dalian Atkinson</a> and <a href="Dean%20Saunders">Dean Saunders</a>, but the team struggled for form in the league and Atkinson was replaced by former Villa striker <a href="Brian%20Little">Brian Little</a> in November 1994. Little assembled a young side which included players as <a href="Gareth%20Southgate">Gareth Southgate</a>, <a href="Steve%20Staunton">Steve Staunton</a>, <a href="Ian%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201968%29">Ian Taylor</a> and <a href="Dwight%20Yorke">Dwight Yorke</a>, leading the club to a fifth League Cup triumph in 1996, beating <a href="Leeds%20United">Leeds United</a> 3–0 at Wembley. Villa finished fourth in the league that season, and fifth the season after.
Following a dip in form, Doug Ellis sacked Brian Little and replaced him with another former Villa player <a href="John%20Gregory%20%28footballer%29">John Gregory</a> in February 1998. One of his first matches in charge was the <a href="Uefa%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> quarter-final against <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, which Villa lost on away goals over two-legs. In the summer of 1998, Villa's star-player Dwight Yorke told Gregory he wanted to leave the club, to which Gregory was later attributed as saying that he "would have shot Yorke if he had had a gun in his office". He was transferred to Manchester United for £12.6 million in August 1998. Gregory managed four top-eight finishes in the league and took the club to an FA Cup final in 2000 with a side that included <a href="David%20James%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201970%29">David James</a>, <a href="Dion%20Dublin">Dion Dublin</a>, <a href="Paul%20Merson">Paul Merson</a> and <a href="Gareth%20Barry">Gareth Barry</a> but was unable to assemble a team capable of challenging for Champions League places. At the end of the season Villa's captain <a href="Gareth%20Southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> handed in a transfer request, claiming that "if I am to achieve in my career, it is time to move on." Gregory's frustration at the lack of investment in the team led to him publicly accusing the chairman Doug Ellis of being "stuck a time warp"; their relationship remained strained until Gregory resigned in January 2002.
Ellis appointed <a href="Graham%20Taylor">Graham Taylor</a> for a second spell in February 2002, but a 16th-place finish in the league led to his replacement with <a href="David%20O%27Leary">David O'Leary</a> in June 2003. After a sixth-place finish in his first season, Villa slid backwards to 10th and 16th-place finishes under O'Leary, culminating in him leaving in the summer of 2006. 
After 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder (approximately 38%), Doug Ellis finally decided to sell his stake in Aston Villa due to ill-health at the age of 82. After much speculation it was announced the club was to be bought by American businessman <a href="Randy%20Lerner">Randy Lerner</a>, owner of <a href="National%20Football%20League">NFL</a> franchise the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>. The arrival of a new owner in Lerner and of manager <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a> marked the start of a new period of optimism at Villa Park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge, investment in state-of-the-art facilities at the <a href="Bodymoor%20Heath%20Training%20Ground">Bodymoor Heath Training Ground</a> and significant investment in the squad in the summer of 2007. The first Cup final of the Lerner era came in 2010 when Villa were beaten 2–1 in the <a href="2010%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup Final</a>.
Just five days before the opening day of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football">2010–11 season</a>, O'Neill resigned as manager, despite three consecutive 6th-place finishes, due to frustration in the lack of investment in the squad, following the sale of star players <a href="Gareth%20Barry">Gareth Barry</a>, <a href="James%20Milner">James Milner</a> and <a href="Ashley%20Young">Ashley Young</a>. His replacement <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Houllier">Gérard Houllier</a> stepped down due to ill-health in September 2011, to be replaced by <a href="Birmingham%20City">Birmingham City</a> manager <a href="Alex%20McLeish">Alex McLeish</a>, despite howls of protest from fans against his appointment. McLeish's contract was terminated at the end of the 2011–12 season after Villa finished in 16th place, and he was replaced by <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a>.
In February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of £53.9 million, and Lerner put the club up for sale three months later. With Lerner still on board, but unwilling to spend following the stock market crash of 2008, the club was uncompetitive for several seasons, culminating in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Aston%20Villa%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a>, when Lambert was sacked in February 2015 after the team managed just 12 goals in the first 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history. <a href="Tim%20Sherwood">Tim Sherwood</a> succeeded him, and steered the club away from relegation while also leading them to the <a href="2015%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2015 FA Cup Final</a>. However, the club sold two of its star players <a href="Christian%20Benteke">Christian Benteke</a> and captain <a href="Fabian%20Delph">Fabian Delph</a> in the summer transfer window and did not adequately replace them. Villa struggled in the 2015–16 season, and Sherwood was sacked following six consecutive defeats. He was replaced by <a href="R%C3%A9mi%20Garde">Rémi Garde</a>, who left after just five months with Villa lying bottom of the table; his reign included a club-record 19 game winless run. The club was relegated at the end of the season, ending their 29-year stay in the top flight.
Takeovers, Championship years and promotion (2016–present).
In June 2016, Chinese businessman <a href="Tony%20Xia">Tony Xia</a> bought the club for £76 million. Former Chelsea boss <a href="Roberto%20Di%20Matteo">Roberto Di Matteo</a> was appointed as the club's new manager, but was sacked after just 12 games following a poor start to the season. He was replaced by former Birmingham manager <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a>. Bruce led the team to finish fourth in the 2017–18 season, but lost in the <a href="2018%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2018 EFL Championship play-off final</a> to <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>.
After failing to secure promotion to the Premier League, Xia sought additional outside investment in the club. On 20 July 2018 it was announced that the <a href="V%20Sports">NSWE group</a>, a company owned by the Egyptian billionaire <a href="Nassef%20Sawiris">Nassef Sawiris</a> and the American billionaire <a href="Wes%20Edens">Wes Edens</a> were to invest in the football club. They purchased a controlling 55% stake in the club and Sawiris took over the role of club chairman, appointing <a href="Christian%20Purslow">Christian Purslow</a> as CEO.
In October 2018, Bruce was sacked after winning only once in a nine match stretch. He was replaced by <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> manager and boyhood Villa fan <a href="Dean%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201971%29">Dean Smith</a>, with former captain <a href="John%20Terry">John Terry</a> and <a href="Richard%20O%27Kelly">Richard O'Kelly</a> as his assistants. Under Smith performances and results improved, with the team finishing fifth and reaching the playoffs again—helped on by a club-record 10 league game winning streak. They reached the <a href="2019%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2019 EFL Championship play-off final</a> and defeated <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> 2–1 to gain promotion back to the Premier League after a three-year absence.
On the eve of Villa's Premier League return, <a href="Recon%20Group">Recon Group</a>'s minority share ownership was bought out by NSWE, meaning Xia no longer had any stake in the club. In Villa's first season back in the Premier League the team battled relegation for most of the season but managed to avoid it with a 17th-place finish, staying up on the final day. In Villa's second season back in the Premier League, Smith oversaw an 11th-place finish, but was unable to persuade star player and captain <a href="Jack%20Grealish">Jack Grealish</a> to remain at the club when Manchester City's British-record £100 million bid triggered his release clause. Following a poor start to the 2021–22 season, which saw seven losses in the club's opening 11 games, Dean Smith was dismissed.
Aston Villa appointed former <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and England captain <a href="Steven%20Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> as head coach on 11 November 2021. After a poor start to the 2022–23 season, in which Villa won just twice and scored only seven goals in their opening 11 games, Gerrard was sacked in October 2022, and replaced by four-time <a href="Europa%20League">Europa League</a>-winning Spanish manager <a href="Unai%20Emery">Unai Emery</a>. He led Villa to 7th place and qualification for the <a href="Europa%20Conference%20League">Europa Conference League</a> in his first season.
Colours and badge.
The club colours are a claret shirt with sky blue sleeves, white shorts with claret and blue trim, and sky blue socks with claret and white trim. They were the original wearers of the claret and blue. Villa's colours at the outset were royal blue caps and stockings, royal blue and scarlet "striped" (in the context of the time, hooped) jerseys, and white knickerbockers, one of the club rules including a provision that "no member can take part in a match without wearing the above uniform". For a few years after that (1877–79) the team wore several different kits from all white, blue and black, red and blue to plain green. By 1880, black jerseys with a <a href="Royal%20Banner%20of%20Scotland">Scottish Lion Rampant</a> embroidered on the chest were introduced by Villa's Scottish leaders <a href="William%20McGregor%20%28football%29">William McGregor</a> and <a href="George%20Ramsay%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201855%29">George Ramsay</a>. This remained the first choice strip for six years. On Monday, 8 November 1886, an entry in the club's official minute book states:
The chocolate colour later became claret. Nobody is quite sure why claret and blue became the club's adopted colours. Several other football teams adopted their distinctive colours including <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>, <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>, <a href="Scunthorpe%20United">Scunthorpe United</a> and Turkish club <a href="Trabzonspor">Trabzonspor</a>. <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20FC">Crystal Palace</a> also played in Villa's colours until the 1970s.
A new badge was revealed in May 2007, for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08</a> season and beyond. The new badge includes a <a href="Star%20%28football%20badge%29">star</a> to represent the European Cup win in 1982, and has a light blue background behind Villa's 'lion rampant'. The traditional motto "Prepared" remains in the badge, and the name Aston Villa has been shortened to AVFC, FC having been omitted from the previous badge. The lion is now unified as opposed to fragmented lions of the past. <a href="Randy%20Lerner">Randy Lerner</a> petitioned fans to help with the design of the new badge.
On 6 April 2016, the club confirmed that it would be using a new badge from the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League">2016–17 season</a> after consulting fan groups for suggestions. The lion in the new badge has claws added to it, and the word "Prepared" was removed to increase the size of the lion and club initials in the badge. In November 2022, following a fan-led vote, the club announced it would adopt a new badge for the following season. The new badge's usage was later clarified to be exclusive to on-field kits and training wear by club president of business operations, Chris Heck, with the existing badge continuing to be utilized as the primary in all other channels.
Kit manufacturers and sponsors.
Tables of kit suppliers and shirt sponsors appear below:
Aston Villa's kit was produced by local manufacturers until 1974, when <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> became the first kit supplier to have its logo on a Villa shirt. Aston Villa's first shirt sponsor was Davenports Breweries in the 1982–83 season. Aston Villa forwent commercial kit sponsorship for the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons; instead advertising the charity <a href="Acorns%20Children%27s%20Hospice">Acorns Children's Hospice</a>, the first deal of its kind in Premier League history. The partnership continued until 2010 when a commercial sponsor replaced Acorns, with the hospice becoming the club's Official Charity Partner. A shirt sleeve sponsor was used for the first time in the 2019–20 season with BR88 being displayed. 
Stadium.
Aston Villa's current home venue is Villa Park; the team previously played at Aston Park (1874–1876) and <a href="Wellington%20Road%20%28Perry%20Barr%29">Wellington Road</a> (1876–1897). Villa Park is the largest football stadium in the English Midlands, and the eighth largest stadium in England. It has hosted 16 England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899, and the most recent in 2005. Thus, it was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries. Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi-final history, having hosted 55 semi-finals. In 2022, the club announced plans to rebuild the North Stand and part of the Trinity Road stand, which will take the maximum capacity over 50,000.
The current training ground is located at <a href="Bodymoor%20Heath%20Training%20Ground">Bodymoor Heath</a> near <a href="Kingsbury%2C%20Warwickshire">Kingsbury</a> in north <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, the site for which was purchased by former chairman Doug Ellis in the early 1970s from a local farmer. Although Bodymoor Heath was state-of-the-art in the 1970s, by the late 1990s the facilities had started to look dated. In November 2005, Ellis and Aston Villa plc announced a state of the art <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>13 million redevelopment of Bodymoor in two phases. The new training ground was officially unveiled on 6 May 2007, by then manager <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a>, then team captain <a href="Gareth%20Barry">Gareth Barry</a> and 1982 European Cup winning team captain <a href="Dennis%20Mortimer">Dennis Mortimer</a>, with the Aston Villa squad moving in for the 2007–08 season.
It was announced on 6 August 2014, that Villa Park would appear in the <a href="FIFA%20%28video%20game%20series%29">FIFA video game</a> from "<a href="FIFA%2015">FIFA 15</a>", with all other Premier League stadiums also fully licensed from this game onwards.
Ownership.
The first shares in the club were issued towards the end of the 19th century as a result of legislation that was intended to codify the growing numbers of professional teams and players in the Association Football leagues. FA teams were required to distribute shares to investors as a way of facilitating trading among the teams without implicating the FA itself. This trading continued for much of the 20th century until Ellis started buying up many of the shares in the 1960s. He was chairman and substantial shareholder of "Aston Villa F.C." from 1968 to 1975 and the majority shareholder from 1982 to 2006. The club were <a href="Initial%20public%20offering">floated</a> on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> (LSE) in 1996, and the share price fluctuated in the ten years after the flotation. In 2006 it was announced that several consortia and individuals were considering bids for Aston Villa.
On 14 August 2006, it was confirmed that <a href="Randy%20Lerner">Randy Lerner</a>, then owner of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>'s <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, had reached an agreement of £62.6 million with Aston Villa for a takeover of the club. Lerner took full control on 18 September with Ellis and his board replaced with a new board by Lerner on 19 September 2006. Lerner appointed himself chairman of the club with <a href="Charles%20Krulak">Charles Krulak</a> as a non-executive director and Ellis awarded the honorary position of Chairman Emeritus. Lerner put the club up for sale in May 2014, valuing it at an estimated £200 million.
On 18 May 2016, Randy Lerner agreed the sale of Aston Villa to <a href="Recon%20Group">Recon Group</a>, owned by Chinese businessman <a href="Tony%20Xia">Tony Xia</a>. The sale was completed on 14 June 2016 for a reported £76 million after being approved by the Football League, with the club becoming part of Recon Group's Sport, Leisure and Tourism division. Recon Group were selected to take over Aston Villa following a selection process by the club.
After failing to secure promotion to the Premier League in the 2017–18 season speculation about financial difficulties at the club began to mount. This prompted the Xia to seek additional investment. On 20 July 2018 it was announced that the NSWE group, an Egyptian company owned by the Egyptian billionaire <a href="Nassef%20Sawiris">Nassef Sawiris</a> and the American billionaire <a href="Wes%20Edens">Wes Edens</a> were to invest in the football club. They purchased a controlling 55% stake in the club and Sawiris took over the role of club chairman. On 9 August 2019, on the eve of Villa's Premier League return, documents from <a href="Companies%20House">Companies House</a> revealed that Recon Group's minority share ownership had been bought out, and Xia no longer had any stake in the club.
Social responsibility.
Aston Villa has a unique relationship with the <a href="Acorns%20Children%27s%20Hospice">Acorns Children's Hospice</a> charity that is groundbreaking in English football. In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated the front of its kit shirts, usually reserved for high-paying sponsorships, to Acorns Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional visibility and more funds. Outside of the shirt sponsorship the club has paid for hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations.
In September 2010, Aston Villa launched an initiative at Villa Park called Villa Midlands Food (VMF) where the club will spend two years training students with Aston Villa hospitality and events in association with Birmingham City Council. The club opened a restaurant in the Trinity Road Stand staffed with 12 students recruited from within a 10-mile (16 km) radius of Villa Park with most of the food served in the restaurant sourced locally.
Aston Villa Foundation.
In 2016, Aston Villa created a <a href="Registered%20Charity">registered charity</a>, the Aston Villa Foundation. The aim of the charity is to deliver the social responsibility work of Aston Villa. Working alongside key local and national stakeholders, the Foundation delivers projects such as football in the community, disability, health and wellbeing, education, interventions and community relations.
In May 2021, <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Prince William, Duke of Cambridge</a> met with members of the Foundation at Aston Villa's <a href="Bodymoor%20Heath%20Training%20Ground">Bodymoor Heath Training Ground</a>. This was following the Foundation providing 1000 hot meals a week to local organisations during the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom</a> as well as allowing a local <a href="NHS%20trust">NHS Trust</a> to make use of <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park's</a> facilities.
Supporters and rivalries.
Aston Villa have a large fanbase and draw support from all over the <a href="English%20Midlands">Midlands</a> and beyond, with supporters' clubs all across the world. Former Villa chief executive Richard Fitzgerald has stated that the ethnicity of the supporters is currently 98% white. When Randy Lerner's regime took over at Villa Park, they aimed to improve the support from ethnic minorities. A number of organisations have been set up to support the local community, including Aston Pride. A Villa in the Community programme has also been set up to encourage support among young people in the region. The new owners have also initiated several surveys aimed at gaining the opinions of Villa fans and to involve them in the decision-making process. Meetings also occur every three months where supporters are invited by ballot and are invited to ask questions to the board. In 2011, the club supported a supporter-based initiative for an official anthem to boost the atmosphere at Villa Park. The song "The Bells Are Ringing" is to be played before games.
Like many English football clubs, Aston Villa has had several <a href="Football%20hooliganism">hooligan firms</a> associated with it: Villa Youth, Steamers, <a href="Aston%20Villa%20Hardcore">Villa Hardcore</a> and the C-Crew, the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s. As can be seen across the whole of English football, the hooligan groups have now been marginalised. In 2004, several Villa firms were involved in a fight with <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">QPR</a> fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died. The main groupings of supporters can now be found in a number of domestic and international supporters' clubs. This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections. There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement. The supporter group <a href="My%20Old%20Man%20Said">My Old Man Said</a> formed to stand up for Villa supporters' rights, as a direct result of Villa supporters' protest against the club's appointment of <a href="Alex%20McLeish">Alex McLeish</a>. The club's supporters also publish <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s such as "Heroes and Villains" and "The Holy Trinity".
Aston Villa's arch-rivals are Birmingham City, with games between the two clubs known as the <a href="Second%20City%20Derby">Second City Derby</a>. Historically though, <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> have arguably been Villa's greatest rivals, a view highlighted in a fan survey, conducted in 2003. The two teams contested three FA Cup finals in the late 19th century. Villa also enjoy less heated local rivalries with <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a>. Through the relegation of West Brom and Birmingham City, to the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Football League Championship</a>, in the <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%202005%E2%80%9306">2005–06</a> season, at the start of <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%202006%E2%80%9307">2006–07</a> Premiership season, Villa were the only Midlands club in that League. The nearest opposing team Villa faced during that season was <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, who played away in South Yorkshire. For the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Premier%20League">2010–11 season</a>, West Bromwich Albion were promoted and joined Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Birmingham City in the Premier League. This marked the first time that the "West Midlands' Big Four" clubs were in the Premier League at the same time, and the first time together in the top flight since the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20in%20English%20football">1983–84 season</a>. Birmingham were relegated at the end of the 2010–11 season, ending this period.
The rivalry with Birmingham City was renewed in 2016–17 when Aston Villa suffered relegation from the Premier League. They were joined by West Brom two years later, but Villa won promotion back to the Premier League in 2019.
Statistics.
Season 2023-24 is Aston Villa's 110th season in the top tier of English football. The only club to have spent longer in the top flight are <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>, with 121 seasons, making Aston Villa versus Everton the most-played fixture in English top-flight football. Aston Villa were relegated from the top tier of English football in 2016, having played in every Premier League season since its establishment in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">1992–93</a>, but were promoted back in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20EFL%20Championship">2018–19</a>. They are ninth in the <a href="All-time%20FA%20Premier%20League%20table">All-time FA Premier League table</a>, and have the fifth highest total of major honours (20) won by an English club.

Villa forward <a href="Archie%20Hunter">Archie Hunter</a> became the first player to score in every round of the FA Cup in Villa's victorious 1887 campaign. Villa's longest unbeaten home run in the FA Cup spanned 13 years and 19 games, from 1888 to 1901.
Aston Villa are one of six English teams to have won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>. They did so on 26 May 1982 in <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, beating <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 1–0 thanks to <a href="Peter%20Withe">Peter Withe</a>'s goal.

Bradford City Association Football Club is an English professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, <a href="West%20Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>. The team competes in <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a>, the fourth tier of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>, and is managed by <a href="Graham%20Alexander">Graham Alexander</a>.
The club was founded in 1903 and immediately elected into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a>. Promotion to the top tier followed as they won the 1907–08 Second Division title and then they went on to win the <a href="1911%20FA%20Cup%20final">1911 FA Cup final</a>, which remains the club's only major honour. They were relegated in 1922 and again in 1927, before winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a> title in 1928–29. Another relegation in 1937 did allow the club to go on to win the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North%20Cup">Third Division North Cup</a> in 1939, however a further relegation followed in 1962 to leave the club in the newly created <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>. They secured promotions back into the third tier in 1969 and 1977, but were relegated in 1972 and 1978. They found success in the 1980s under the stewardship of first <a href="Roy%20McFarland">Roy McFarland</a> and then <a href="Trevor%20Cherry">Trevor Cherry</a>, winning promotion in 1981–82 and following this up with the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> title in 1984–85, though they were relegated out of the Second Division in 1990.
Bradford were promoted back into the second tier via the play-offs in <a href="1996%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20final">1996</a>, before securing another promotion in 1998–99 to reach the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, marking a return to the top-flight after a 77-year absence. They entered Europe and reached the semi-finals of the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a> in 2000–01 but ended the campaign with relegation from the Premier League. A succession of financial crises followed as the club entered <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> twice in two years and further relegations followed in 2004 and 2007 to leave the club back in the fourth tier. They found success under the management of <a href="Phil%20Parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> by reaching the <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2013 League Cup final</a> and then going on to win that year's <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20Two%20play-off%20final">League Two play-off final</a> but were relegated from <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> in 2019.

History.
Bradford City were formed in 1903 as a result of a series of meetings called by James Whyte, a sub-editor of the "Bradford Observer", with <a href="The%20Football%20Association">Football Association</a> representatives and officials at <a href="Manningham%20F.C.">Manningham F.C.</a>, a <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> side. The <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> saw the invitation as a chance to promote association football in the rugby league-dominated county of the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>. It duly elected the new club into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, in place of <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a>. Four days later, at the 23rd annual meeting of Manningham FC, the committee decided to change codes from rugby league to association football. Bradford City Association Football Club were formed without having played a game, taking over Manningham's colours of claret and amber, and their <a href="Valley%20Parade">Valley Parade</a> ground.
<a href="Robert%20Campbell%20%28football%20manager%29">Robert Campbell</a> was appointed the club's first manager and with the help of the new committee, he assembled a playing squad at the cost of <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>917 10<a href="shilling">s</a> 0<a href="penny">d</a>. City's first game was a 2–0 defeat at <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> on 1 September 1903, six days before their first home game attracted 11,000 fans. The club finished 10th in their first season. <a href="Peter%20O%27Rourke%20%28footballer%29">Peter O'Rourke</a> took over as manager in November 1905, and he led City to the Second Division title in <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">1907–08</a> and with it <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>. Having narrowly avoided relegation in their first season in the top flight, City recorded their highest finish of 5th in <a href="1910%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football">1910–11</a>. The same season they won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, when a goal from captain <a href="Jimmy%20Speirs">Jimmy Speirs</a> won the <a href="1911%20FA%20Cup%20final">final</a> replay against <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. City's defence of the cup, which included the first <a href="Bradford%20derby">Bradford derby</a> against <a href="Bradford%20Park%20Avenue%20A.F.C.">Bradford Park Avenue</a>, was stopped by <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> after a run of 12 consecutive clean sheets.
City remained in the top flight in the period up to the First World War and for three seasons afterwards, but were relegated in <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20in%20English%20football">1921–22</a> along with <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Back in the Second Division, attendances dropped and City struggled for form, with five consecutive finishes in the bottom half of the table. They suffered a second relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division (North)</a> in <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20in%20English%20football">1926–27</a>. Two seasons later, O'Rourke, who had initially retired in 1921 following the death of his son, returned and guided City to promotion with a record haul of 128 goals. O'Rourke left for a second time after one more season, and although City spent a total of eight seasons back in the Second Division, they rarely looked like earning promotion back to the top flight. Instead in <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20in%20English%20football">1936–37</a>, the club were relegated back to the Third Division (North). City won their third piece of silverware two seasons later, when they lifted the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North%20Cup">Third Division North Challenge Cup</a>, but they were unable to defend the trophy because competitive football was suspended for the Second World War.
After the war, City went through two managers in the first two seasons, and were consistently in the bottom half of the Third Division (North) table until <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20in%20English%20football">1955–56</a>. After three successive top half finishes, City were placed in the new national <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a>. Bradford spent just three seasons in the Third Division, but during their relegation season in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a>, they upset First Division side Manchester United in the inaugural season of the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>. With 34 goals from <a href="David%20Layne">David Layne</a>, City nearly earned promotion the following season <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20in%20English%20football">1961–62</a>, but did also suffer a record 9–1 defeat to <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a>. Layne left for <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, and without him City finished second from bottom of the league and had to apply for re-election. Bradford City just failed to win promotion in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20in%20English%20football">1963–64</a>, winning more games than any other team in the division that season, twenty five, with <a href="Rodney%20Green%20%28footballer%29">Rodney Green</a> top scoring with 29 league goals. There followed three difficult seasons during which time manager <a href="Grenville%20Hair">Grenville Hair</a> died following a heart attack in training, City returned to the Third Division after getting promoted in <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20in%20English%20football">1968–69</a>. City's stay in the Third Division lasted just three years, when they finished bottom in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20in%20English%20football">1971–72</a>. Promotion via fourth spot was won again in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77</a> but it was instantly followed by a relegation season.
City failed to win promotion for three successive seasons, until the board appointed former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> <a href="centre%20back">centre back</a> <a href="Roy%20McFarland">Roy McFarland</a> as manager in May 1981. McFarland won promotion in his first season, but was poached by his former club <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> just six months later. City won compensation from Derby and installed another England international <a href="Trevor%20Cherry">Trevor Cherry</a> as McFarland's replacement. Cherry, with former teammate <a href="Terry%20Yorath">Terry Yorath</a> as his assistant manager, failed to win for two months, but eventually the pair guided City to safety from relegation. During the summer, however, the club chairman Bob Martin had to call in the <a href="official%20receiver">official receiver</a>s. The club was saved by former chairman <a href="Stafford%20Heginbotham">Stafford Heginbotham</a> and former board member Jack Tordoff, but to ensure the club could start the new season, prize asset, striker <a href="Bobby%20Campbell%20%28Northern%20Irish%20footballer%29">Bobby Campbell</a> was sold to Derby. City struggled but so did Campbell, and when he returned, the club went on a record run of ten successive victories. Although they missed out on promotion, City won the league the following season <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85</a>, to return to the second tier of the Football League. However, City's triumph was overshadowed when the main stand at Valley Parade <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">caught fire</a> during the final game of the season, killing 56 people.
City played games away from Valley Parade for 19 months. But just ten days after the new £2.6 million ground was opened, Cherry was sacked. His replacement, <a href="Terry%20Dolan%20%28footballer%29">Terry Dolan</a>, steered City away from possible relegation, before he mounted a promotion challenge the following season. City went top of the table in September 1987, but fell away during Christmas and missed out on promotion on the final day of the season. Instead, they entered the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship%20play-offs">play-offs</a> but were defeated in the semi-finals by <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>. Two years later City were relegated back to the Third Division. For three seasons, City finished mid-table in the third tier, which was renamed Division Two following the formation of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992.
In January 1994, <a href="Geoffrey%20Richmond">Geoffrey Richmond</a> came from <a href="Scarborough%20F.C.">Scarborough</a> to take over as chairman, and promised to guide City to the Premier League within five years. He cleared the debts and after four months sacked manager <a href="Frank%20Stapleton">Frank Stapleton</a> to appoint his own manager, <a href="Lennie%20Lawrence">Lennie Lawrence</a>. Lawrence left after little more than a year to join <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> but his successor, <a href="Chris%20Kamara">Chris Kamara</a>, took City to the <a href="Football%20League%20One%20play-offs">play-offs</a> and their first game at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. They defeated <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> 2–0 in the <a href="1996%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20final">final</a> to earn promotion to Division One. City avoided relegation the following season by winning their last two league games, 1–0 against <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> and then beating <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> 3–0 on the final day of the season, but Kamara was sacked in January 1998. <a href="Paul%20Jewell">Paul Jewell</a> took over, initially on a temporary basis, before he was given a permanent contract. He bought the club's first £1 million signings and guided the club to the Premier League — the first time they had been in the top flight for 77 years — with a second-place finish. The following season, Jewell continued to defy the critics, who labelled his team "<a href="Dad%27s%20Army">Dad's Army</a>", by avoiding relegation again on the last day with a 1–0 victory over <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, with a goal from <a href="David%20Wetherall">David Wetherall</a>.
However, Jewell left shortly afterwards. His assistant <a href="Chris%20Hutchings">Chris Hutchings</a> was promoted to the manager's position, and despite a series of new expensive signings, he was sacked by November 2000, with City second from bottom of the league. <a href="Jim%20Jefferies%20%28footballer%29">Jim Jefferies</a> took over but could not save the club from relegation. At the end of the first season back in Division One, City were placed in <a href="administration%20%28insolvency%29">administration</a> with debts of nearly £13 million. Two years later, the club suffered a second spell in administration and a second relegation. Two top-half finishes followed, but the club were relegated for a third time in seven seasons in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07</a> meaning the following season would be their first in the bottom tier for 26 seasons. Former player <a href="Stuart%20McCall">Stuart McCall</a> was appointed the new manager, and although he said anything less than promotion would be a failure, he finally led the team to a 10th-place finish. McCall eventually left Bradford City on 8 February 2010 following a board meeting after a run of poor results.
In September 2011, the club became linked with American amateur side <a href="SC%20United%20Bantams">SC United Bantams</a>.
In January 2013, City became the first club from the fourth tier of English football since <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a> in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Football%20League%20Cup">1962</a> to reach the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> final, and the first fourth tier club ever to reach a major Wembley Cup final. They defeated three <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> sides en route to the final – <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> 4–2 on penalties in the fourth round, <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 3–2 on penalties in the quarter-finals and <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> 4–3 on aggregate over the two legs of the semi-final. They met Premier League side <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a> in the <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a> but lost 5–0.
The run to the final is thought to have been worth at least £1.3 million to the club, with joint chairman Mark Lawn stating that the final itself could be worth an additional £1 million, taking the club's total earnings to £2.3 million during their <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Football%20League%20Cup">cup campaign</a>. On 18 May 2013, the club returned to <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a> where they defeated <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a> 3–0 in the League Two <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20Two%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a> to secure a place in <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> for 2013–14.
On 24 January 2015, Bradford City caused an upset by beating Premiership leaders <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> 4–2 away in the FA Cup. The victory sent Bradford through to the fifth round for the first time in eighteen years. They beat <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, another Premier League club, 2–0 at home in the next round on 15 February 2015. In the quarter-finals, the Bantams faced <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> at home, in a game that ended in a goalless draw. The replay was played on 16 March 2015 at the Madejski Stadium, where Reading won 3–0.
The club was relegated to League Two at the end of the 2018–19 season.
In December 2021, the club was approached by American investors known as WAGMI United (who use cryptocurrency and NFTs) about a possible buyout. The offer was rejected.
On 24 February 2022, <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a> was appointed manager of the club on a contract until the summer of 2024. He was sacked on 4 October 2023, with player <a href="Kevin%20McDonald%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201988%29">Kevin McDonald</a> becoming player-caretaker manager. Later that month, assistant manager <a href="Mark%20Trueman">Mark Trueman</a> replaced McDonald as caretaker manager.
Colours and club crest.
Bradford City is the only professional football club in England to wear claret and amber. The club colours were inherited from <a href="Manningham%20FC">Manningham FC</a>, when the club converted to football upon Bradford City's foundation in 1903. However, whereas Manningham played in hoops, the new football club adopted claret and amber stripes. Manningham RFC adopted the colours in 1884 before the move to Valley Parade in 1886. Having originally worn black shirts with white shorts, the club's first game in claret and amber was against Hull on 20 September 1884, at Carlisle Road.
The reason Manningham chose claret and amber is not documented but the colours were the same as those of <a href="West%20Yorkshire%20Regiment">The Prince of Wales's Own West Yorkshire Regiment</a>, which was based at Belle Vue Barracks on nearby Manningham Lane. Both Manningham, from 1886, and Bradford City, from 1903 to 1908, used the barracks as changing and club rooms.
Bradford City has worn claret and amber, with either white or black, since it was founded. Since the fire in 1985, the club has used black on the kit as a memorial to the 56 supporters who died. The club's away shirt has traditionally been white and to a lesser extent also blue, but there has been a profusion of other colours and designs particularly in more recent years. The away kit for the 2008–09 season was all white. For the 2009–10 season, the away kit was all black with a thin claret and amber stripe down the centre-left.
City scarves have also sold in large numbers in recent years to fans of "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>", because the colours are the same as Harry's house scarf at <a href="Hogwarts">Hogwarts School</a>.
A number of other clubs across the world wear claret and amber. They include Scottish club <a href="Motherwell%20F.C.">Motherwell</a>, who originally wore blue and white until they wore claret and amber for the first time on 23 August 1913, against Celtic. It is erroneously believed that Motherwell chose the claret and amber colours because they were the racing colours of Lord Hamilton; it is more likely that Motherwell were influenced by Bradford City's English FA cup win in 1911.
The club's crest combines a series of logos from over the years. In 1974, City adopted a contemporary style crest incorporating the club's initials, with a B-C logo. At the time, the new logo maintained the previous nickname of the Paraders. By December 1981, the club relaunched the Bantams as the official identity with a bantam on the new crest. The crest maintains the club colours and also includes the words The Bantams.
Nickname.
Bradford City have had a number of nicknames during their history. In their early years, they were referred to as the Robins or Wasps, taking over the nickname of Manningham FC, as a result of Manningham's claret and amber hoops. Other nicknames have been the Citizens or Paraders, but the club is better known as the Bantams.
Stadium.
<a href="Valley%20Parade">Valley Parade</a> was the site of a <a href="quarry">quarry</a> on the hillside below <a href="Manningham%2C%20Bradford">Manningham, Bradford</a>, owned by Midland Railway Company, in 1886, when Manningham RFC bought one-third of the land and leased the remainder, because they had been forced to find a new home. They spent <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>1,400 erecting a ground with a capacity of 20,000, club facilities and levelling the land. When Bradford City were formed in 1903, they took over the ground at Valley Parade, which was also at this time the headquarters of <a href="West%20Riding%20Artillery">The 2nd West Riding Brigade Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force)</a>, playing their first home game on 5 September 1903 against <a href="Gainsborough%20Trinity%20F.C.">Gainsborough Trinity</a>, drawing a crowd of 11,000. Five years later, the club won promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, and so commissioned football architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> to redevelop the ground. The capacity was increased to 40,000 by December 1908 with a 5,300-seater main stand, a <a href="terrace%20%28stadium%29">terraced</a> paddock in front, a <a href="Spion%20Kop%20%28stadia%29">Spion Kop</a>, and an 8,000-capacity Midland Road stand. Its first game against <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> on Christmas Day attracted a crowd of 36,000. On 11 March 1911, Valley Parade attracted its highest attendance 39,146, for an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> game between Bradford City and <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> during Bradford's <a href="1911%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup winning run</a>.
Until 1952, by which time Bradford City had bought the remaining two-thirds of the ground to own it outright, the ground remained virtually unchanged. However, twice during the next decade, the club's Midland Road stand had to be demolished. Club officials first closed part of the stand in 1952, as a result of the <a href="Burnden%20Park%20disaster">Burnden Park disaster</a> six years earlier. Its frame was sold to <a href="Berwick%20Rangers%20F.C.">Berwick Rangers</a> and a replacement stand built in 1954. Six years later, the new stand was itself demolished, and Valley Parade remained a three-sided ground until 1966, when the pitch was moved, and a new stand built.
On 11 May 1985, Valley Parade was the scene of a <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">fatal fire</a>, during which 56 supporters were killed and at least 265 were injured. The game was the final match of the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85</a> season, before which City were presented with the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> championship trophy. The fire destroyed the wooden main stand in just nine minutes. The club played its home games at <a href="Odsal%20Stadium">Odsal Stadium</a>, a rugby league ground in Bradford, <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a>, Leeds, and <a href="Leeds%20Road%2C%20Huddersfield">Leeds Road</a>, the former home of Huddersfield Town, until December 1986, while Valley Parade was redeveloped. The club spent £2.6 million building a new main stand and improving the Kop and reopened the new ground on 14 December 1986 for an exhibition match against an England international XI.
In 1991, the Bradford end of the ground was the next to be redeveloped and was converted into a two-tier stand with a scoreboard. In 1996, following City's promotion to <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a>, club chairman <a href="Geoffrey%20Richmond">Geoffrey Richmond</a> announced the construction of a 4,500 seater stand on the Midland Road side. Ahead of promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premiership</a> in 1999, Richmond spent another £6.5 million to convert the Kop into a two-tier 7,500-seat capacity stand. A corner stand between the Kop and main stand was opened in December 2000, taking the capacity to 20,000 for the first time since 1970. The following summer, the main stand was also converted into a two-tier stand, taking the capacity to 25,136. Further projects were planned until the club went into <a href="administration%20%28insolvency%29">administration</a> in May 2002 so none have taken place. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb's pension fund for £5 million, with the club's offices, the shop and car park sold to London-based Development Securities for £2.5 million, but these (club offices, shop and car park) were bought back by the club's joint chairmen in the summer of 2011. The club's annual rent and maintenance costs to Gibb's pension fund is £1.2m, and so as of February 2009, the club is considering a return to Odsal. The club and Bradford Bulls would share the new £50m complex, which would also feature <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, cycling and <a href="sport%20of%20athletics">athletics</a> facilities. Valley Parade has had several other names under sponsorship naming deals. In July 2016 it became the Northern Commercials Stadium, and in July 2019 it became the <a href="Utilita%20Energy">Utilita Energy</a> Stadium. This partnership came to an end in July 2022. The <a href="University%20of%20Bradford">University of Bradford</a> subsequently became title sponsor of Valley Parade.
Supporters.
The club spearheaded an initiative in 2007 to slash the price of watching professional football for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08</a> season. As a result, season tickets to watch Bradford City were the cheapest in England at £138, the equivalent of £6 per match. When the offer finished, the club confirmed the amount of season tickets sold was 12,019. The scheme enabled the club to top the average league attendances for <a href="Football%20League%20Two">Football League Two</a> during the 2007–08 season, attracting more than three times more than any other club. The club won the Perform Best Fan Marketing campaign category in <a href="The%20Football%20League%20Awards">The Football League Awards</a> for the scheme and earned them an invitation to the <a href="Houses%20of%20Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a>. The club aimed to attract 20,000 fans for the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09</a> by offering a free season ticket to anyone buying a season ticket as long as 9,000 adults sign up, but they fell 704 short of the target. Joint-chairman Mark Lawn announced in November 2008 that season tickets in the Bradford End for the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10</a> season would be available for just £99 and £138 for the rest of the ground if bought in December 2008.
For the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20in%20English%20football">2015–16</a> season, the club announced its latest season ticket scheme aimed at continuing to make football affordable for fans. Season ticket prices were set at £149 for adults, senior citizens and students, while admission for under-11s was free when purchased with an adult ticket. An initial campaign target of 15,000 was set. On 6 July, the club announced a record-breaking 18,000 tickets had been sold following a successful campaign. The campaign was repeated for the <a href="2016-17%20Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2016–17 season</a>, where the club sold in excess of 17,000 tickets.
Bradford City have one official <a href="mascot">mascot</a>, Billy Bantam.
Bradford City announced 'Own The Moment' 2022–23 season ticket sales of 14,190 in September 2022. The figure was a League Two record for the club. It surpassed the previous fourth-tier season-ticket sales record of 13,614 in 2019–20.
On 4 March 2023, Bradford City set a new attendance record for Football League Two at a 2–0 victory against <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a>, with an attendance of 20,383, including 345 away fans. The Bantams then broke this record again in a home fixture on 8 May 2023 against <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a>, with 22,576 supporters in attendance, including 1,902 Leyton Orient fans.

Coventry City F.C.

Coventry City Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a>, England. The team currently play in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>, the second level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>.
Coventry City formed as Singers F.C. in 1883 following a general meeting of the Singer Gentleman's club. They adopted their current name in 1898 and joined the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> in 1908, before being selected into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1919. Relegated in 1925, they returned to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> as champions of the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> and <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South%20Cup">Third Division South Cup</a> winners in 1935–36. Relegated in 1952, they won promotion in the inaugural <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> season in 1958–59. Coventry reached the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> after winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> title in 1963–64 and the Second Division title in 1966– 67 under the management of <a href="Jimmy%20Hill">Jimmy Hill</a>. In the 1970–71 season, the team competed in the European <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>, reaching the second round. Despite beating <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 2–1 in the home leg, they had lost 6–1 in the first leg in Germany, and thus were eliminated.
Coventry's only period in the top division to date lasted 34 consecutive years between 1967 and 2001, and the club were inaugural members of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992. They won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in 1987, the club's only major trophy, when they beat <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 3–2. They experienced further relegations in 2012 and 2017, though did manage to win the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">EFL Trophy</a> in <a href="2017%20EFL%20Trophy%20Final">2017</a>.
Coventry returned to Wembley in <a href="2018%20EFL%20League%20Two%20play-off%20Final">2018</a>, beating <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> in the <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> play-off final. Manager <a href="Mark%20Robins">Mark Robins</a> built on this success guiding the Sky Blues to eighth in League One the next season and then led the club to promotion back to the EFL Championship as <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> champions in 2020. In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Coventry%20City%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a>, Coventry secured a play-off place in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>, before losing the play-off final to <a href="Luton%20Town">Luton Town</a> on penalties. 
For 106 years, from 1899 to 2005, Coventry City played at <a href="Highfield%20Road">Highfield Road</a>. The 32,609-capacity <a href="Coventry%20Building%20Society%20Arena">Coventry Arena</a> was opened in August 2005 to replace Highfield Road, but the club has struggled with the new stadium lease since moving.
History.
Early years (1883–1919).
Coventry City was founded in 1883 as Singers F.C., following a meeting between <a href="William%20Stanley%20%28football%20manager%29">William Stanley</a> and seven colleagues from the <a href="Singer%20Motors">Singer Cycle Company</a> at the Lord Aylesford Inn in <a href="Hillfields">Hillfields</a>. It was one of several 19th century clubs linked to Coventry's bicycle factories, and the company founder <a href="George%20Singer%20%28cycle%20manufacturer%29">George Singer</a> was its first president. Singers joined the <a href="Birmingham%20County%20Football%20Association">Birmingham County Football Association</a> in 1884 and played around forty games in their first four years at Dowells Field in the <a href="Stoke%2C%20Coventry">Stoke</a> area. In early seasons they lacked a regular playing staff and sometimes lacked equipment such as goal nets. In 1887, the club moved to the larger Stoke Road Ground, which had rudimentary stands, and they charged an entrance fee for the first time. The following five seasons were very successful, culminating in back-to-back Birmingham Junior Cup titles in 1891 and 1892.
Singers turned professional in 1892 and joined the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League">Birmingham & District League</a> in 1894, competing against strong <a href="Reserve%20team">reserve sides</a> from established regional teams such as <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. Coventry residents not connected to the cycle company began supporting the club, and it was renamed Coventry City in 1898. <a href="Highfield%20Road">Highfield Road</a> opened in 1899, but its construction caused a financial crisis and subsequent salary disputes with the players. The club endured several poor seasons on the field, having to re-apply for membership of the league three times in the space of five years. In 1901, Coventry suffered their worst ever defeat with an 11–2 loss against Worcester-based Berwick Rangers in the qualifying round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. The club became a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a> in July 1907 and the team was more successful the following season, reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time before being eliminated by <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>.
In 1908, Coventry joined the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>, at the time the third-strongest English division. In their second season, Coventry reached the FA Cup quarter final, beating top-flight teams <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston</a> and <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> before losing to Everton. Another two successful seasons followed but in 1914 the club was relegated, amid renewed financial problems. Its economic health worsened as attendances dropped sharply, and the club was in danger of dissolution. It was saved in part by the abandonment of competitive football in mid-1915 due to <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The club's debts were then paid off by benefactor David Cooke in 1917. During the war, they played some friendly matches against local clubs and joined a temporary wartime division for <a href="1918%E2%80%9319%20in%20English%20football">1918–19</a>.
League football and the "Old Five" (1919–1945).
In 1919, Coventry submitted a successful application to join the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> and were placed into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> for the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20 season</a>, the first played after the war. In preparation for league football, the club invested in new players and increased Highfield Road's capacity to 40,000. They avoided finishing last in 1919–20 when they won their final game against <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>, but this result was later found to be <a href="Match%20fixing">rigged</a>, the club receiving a heavy fine in 1923. In <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20in%20English%20football">1924–25</a>, after their sixth successive relegation battle, Coventry finished bottom of the table and dropped into the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a>. A year later they were asked by the League to switch to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a>, to keep the sizes of the divisions even. Their poor form continued, and in <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20in%20English%20football">1927–28</a> they narrowly avoided having to seek <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-election</a>. Supporters rioted after the final game that season, some calling for the club to be wound up and a <a href="Phoenix%20club%20%28sports%29">phoenix club</a> established in its place. In 1928, the club's worst ever attendance was recorded with a gate of 2,059 for a match against <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>.
In addition to poor form on the field, the club ran into financial difficulties by the end of the 1920s, having to rely on fundraisers by supporters and a cash injection by Cooke, who had become club president. A committee of enquiry in 1928 concluded that the club was being mismanaged, leading to resignation of chairman W. Carpenter and his replacement by <a href="Walter%20Brandish">Walter Brandish</a>. The club's form began to improve under the new board, and the appointment of <a href="Harry%20Storer%20Jr.">Harry Storer</a> as manager in 1931 brought in an era of success at the club. Coventry scored a total of 108 goals in the <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20in%20English%20football">1931–32 season</a>, gaining the nickname "The Old Five" as a result of scoring five or more in many games. New signing <a href="Clarrie%20Bourton">Clarrie Bourton</a>'s individual tally of 49 goals was the Football League record for that season, and his overall total of 50 remains the club record. Two further 100-goal seasons followed, the first time in the league that a team had achieved three in a row, and Coventry recorded their largest ever league victory in April 1934, 9–0 against <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a>. Despite scoring heavily, Coventry missed out on promotion every season until <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20in%20English%20football">1935–36</a>, when they finished as Third Division North champions.
The club continued their good form in the second tier, finishing eighth, fourth and fourth again between 1936 and 1939. They also constructed a new main stand and purchased the freehold of Highfield Road, utilising a loan of £20,000 from local motor-industry entrepreneur <a href="John%20Siddeley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Kenilworth">John Siddeley</a>. In <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20in%20English%20football">1937–38</a> they met with Midlands rivals Aston Villa the first time in league football, securing with a win and a draw in the two meetings as well as a higher-placed finish than the Birmingham club. In September 1939, the league season was aborted after three games due to the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Many supporters at the time blamed the war for robbing the team of a probable imminent promotion to the First Division, although several top players including Bourton had been sold by 1939, and attendances had begun to fall. Coventry continued playing some friendly games until November 1940, when the <a href="Coventry%20Blitz">Coventry Blitz</a> damaged the stadium and brought all football in the city to a halt. Friendly matches resumed again in 1942, as parts of Highfield Road had been rebuilt, and the team joined the Midland Regional League.
Rise to the First Division, Europe, and FA Cup victory (1945–1987).
Storer left Coventry for <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> after the war, and many of the 1939 squad had retired by 1945. New manager <a href="Dick%20Bayliss">Dick Bayliss</a> assembled a squad with a mixture of pre-war players and newcomers, but his tenure was cut short when he died after being stranded in a snow storm in 1947. Replacement <a href="Billy%20Frith">Billy Frith</a> was dismissed following a poor start to 1948–49 and the club persuaded Storer to return from Birmingham. In <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20in%20English%20football">1950–51</a>, Coventry led the Second Division table at Christmas, but a poor run ended their promotion hopes and the following season they were relegated. They spent the next six seasons in the Third Division South, with seven different managers, but were never in contention for promotion. The average attendance at Highfield Road dropped sharply during this period, and several top players had to be sold amid financial difficulties. In 1958, the north and south divisions were replaced by <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">a single nationwide third</a> and <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">a new fourth</a>. Coventry were placed in the latter as a result of a bottom-half finish in <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20in%20English%20football">1957–58</a>. Three games into <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a>, the club occupied its lowest ever overall league position, 91st, but recovered to secure promotion back into the third tier.
The appointment of <a href="Derrick%20Robins">Derrick Robins</a> as chairman in 1958 and <a href="Jimmy%20Hill">Jimmy Hill</a> as manager in 1961, marked the start of the "Sky Blue revolution" at the club. Hill changed the club's kit colour and nickname, introduced the <a href="Sky%20Blue%20Song">Sky Blue Song</a>, and added pre-match entertainment. Backed by an injection of cash from Robins, Hill led Coventry to the Third and Second Division championships in 1964 and 1967 respectively, taking them to the top division for the first time. Coventry's record attendance was set in 1967, against fellow title-chasers <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>; the official gate was 51,455 although the club estimated that the figure was higher. In <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20in%20English%20football">1969–70</a>, under Hill's successor <a href="Noel%20Cantwell">Noel Cantwell</a>, the club finished sixth in the First Division, which remains their highest ever position. The top-six finish earned them a place in the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>, which ended in the second round with a 7–3 <a href="Two-legged%20tie">aggregate defeat</a> against <a href="F.C.%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. In the mid-1970s, the club faced renewed financial difficulty and sold several top players. A relegation battle followed in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77</a>, which culminated in <a href="Coventry%20City%202%E2%80%932%20Bristol%20City%20%281977%29">a controversial 2–2 draw</a> with <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> that saw both sides survive at the expense of Sunderland, playing out the final minutes without any attempt to score further goals. A season of success followed in 1977–78, as Coventry finished seventh, narrowly missing a European place. In 1980–81, Coventry reached their first major semi-final, losing to <a href="West%20Ham%20United">West Ham United</a> in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Football%20League%20Cup">the League Cup</a>.
Hill returned to the club as managing director in 1975, and was elevated to chairman in 1980. He initiated several transformations at the club, including the conversion of Highfield Road to England's first all-seat stadium in 1981, and the opening of a sports centre and training ground in <a href="Ryton-on-Dunsmore">Ryton-on-Dunsmore</a>. Hill attempted to rename the club "Coventry Talbot", after <a href="Talbot">their sponsors</a>, but this was rejected by the <a href="Football%20Association">Football Association</a>. To pay for the developments, the club sold top players including popular striker <a href="Tommy%20Hutchison">Tommy Hutchison</a>, and results suffered. Hill was forced out of the club in 1983 and <a href="Terrace%20%28stadium%29">terraces</a> reintroduced. Despite surviving relegation battles for four successive seasons, with three changes of manager, by 1986 the club had assembled a strong squad. Under duo <a href="George%20Curtis%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201939%29">George Curtis</a> and <a href="John%20Sillett">John Sillett</a>, they spent most of the following season in the top eight, and advanced to the <a href="1987%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1987 FA Cup Final</a>. In a match later described by Steven Pye of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"' as a "classic final", Coventry beat <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 3–2 at Wembley which, , is the club's only major trophy to date.
Recent history (1987–present).
Coventry's FA Cup defence ended with a <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20FA%20Cup%23Fourth%20round%20proper">fourth-round defeat</a> to <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>, followed a season later by one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history when they <a href="Sutton%20United%202%E2%80%931%20Coventry%20City%20%281989%29">lost 2–1</a> to non-league <a href="Sutton%20United%20F.C.">Sutton United</a> in the third round. They <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">finished seventh</a> in the league that season, however, their highest finish since 1978. A last-day escape <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Coventry%20City%20F.C.%20season">in 1991–92</a> earned Coventry a place in the newly-formed <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. <a href="Bryan%20Richardson">Bryan Richardson</a> took over as club chairman in summer 1993, making large sums of money available for players over subsequent years. With <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a> and then <a href="Gordon%20Strachan">Gordon Strachan</a> as manager, Coventry signed several high-profile players such as <a href="Dion%20Dublin">Dion Dublin</a>, <a href="Moustapha%20Hadji">Moustapha Hadji</a> and <a href="Robbie%20Keane">Robbie Keane</a>, but did not finish higher than 11th place for the remainder of their Premier League tenure.
In 1997, Richardson revealed the initial proposals for <a href="Coventry%20Building%20Society%20Arena">a new stadium</a> in the north of Coventry, at the time envisaged as having 40,000 seats and included in <a href="England%202006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20bid">England's unsuccessful bid for the 2006 World Cup</a>. The project was backed by <a href="Coventry%20City%20Council">Coventry City Council</a> and gained planning permission in 1998, but involved high costs, inducing the board to sell Highfield Road to a property developer and lease it back, before construction had started. On the field, Coventry were forced by the rising debts to sell their top players without replacement, and were finally relegated <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Coventry%20City%20F.C.%20season">in 2000–01</a>, ending 34 years of continuous tenure in the top flight.
In their <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Coventry%20City%20F.C.%20season">first season</a> back in <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">the second tier</a>, Coventry occupied 4th place with seven games remaining, but ultimately finished 11th, outside the <a href="English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-off</a> places. The new stadium opened in 2005, having been reduced in size and delayed several times; the club had previously sold its 50% share to the <a href="Alan%20Higgs">Alan Higgs</a> charity to repay debts. The club's financial situation remained poor, and by 2007 they faced the possibility of being forced out of business; this was averted when the club was bought by hedge fund owner Sisu Capital. Led by chairman <a href="Ray%20Ranson">Ray Ranson</a>, Coventry signed several promising youngsters in the early Sisu years, but they failed to achieve on-field success. Sisu began reducing investment from 2009 as debts mounted, leading eventually to Ranson's resignation in 2011. They were relegated to <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Coventry%20City%20F.C.%20season">in 2012</a>, and were forced to groundshare with <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a> for more than a year from 2013, following a rent dispute with the Ricoh Arena owners. The club also fell into liquidation, but were allowed to continue playing in League One under Sisu company Otium.
In <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Coventry%20City%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a>, Coventry were relegated to <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a>, but also <a href="2017%20EFL%20Trophy%20Final">won the EFL Trophy</a> in the same season, their first trophy for 30 years. The following season, their first in the fourth tier since 1959, they were promoted straight back, finishing sixth and beating <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> in <a href="2018%20EFL%20League%20Two%20play-off%20Final">the play-off final</a>. Two seasons later, they were promoted again, being awarded the League One championship via a points-per-game system after the season was curtailed due to <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. At the time of curtailment in March 2020, they led the table with 67 points from 34 games. They were exiled from the Ricoh Arena again from 2019 to 2021, playing their home games at <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20%28stadium%29">St Andrew's</a> in Birmingham, amid ongoing legal action by Sisu over the 2014 purchase of the stadium by rugby club <a href="Wasps%20R.F.C.">Wasps</a>, which concluded only in 2022 when the European Commission declined to hear an appeal.
The Sisu era at Coventry City ended in 2023, when local businessman Doug King purchased the club. King had also attempted to acquire the CBS Arena, after both Wasps and the stadium holding company had fallen into administration, but his bid came too late and the stadium was eventually sold to <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28businessman%29">Mike Ashley</a>. Coventry went on to finish fifth in the Championship at the end of the season, earning <a href="2023%20English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">a play-off place</a>. After beating Middlesbrough in the semi-final they played in the <a href="2023%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2023 EFL Championship play-off final</a> at Wembley, missing out on promotion to the Premier League after a 6–5 <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a> defeat against <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>.
Playing kit.
Colours.
Coventry's home shirts are either completely or predominantly sky blue. However, in past seasons, different 'home colours' were worn. For example, in 1889, the then Singers FC wore pink and blue halved shirts (mirroring the corporate colours of Singers Motors). Furthermore, in the 1890s, black and red were the club's colours. In the early 1920s, the club wore red and green (to reflect the colours of the city crest). Sky blue was first used by Coventry in 1898 and the theme was used until 1922. Variations of blue and white were then used until the 1960s and the beginning of the 'sky blue revolution'. The colour made its return in 1962 thanks to the then manager, Jimmy Hill. To mark the 125th year of the club, Coventry wore a special brown shirt in the last home game of the 2008–09 season against Watford, having first worn a chocolate brown away kit in 1978. This kit has been cited by some as the worst in English football history, but also has an iconic status with some fans.
In 2012, in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20FA%20Cup%23Third%20round%20proper">Third round</a> <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> tie versus Southampton, the team wore a commemorative blue and white striped kit, marking the 25th anniversary of the club winning the FA Cup in <a href="1987%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1987</a>. The strip was worn again in January 2013 for Coventry's <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20FA%20Cup%23Third%20round%20proper">3rd round</a> FA Cup fixture with Tottenham Hotspur, whom they beat in the 1987 final. In 2019, Coventry City announced a new third kit in black and white honouring the city's connection with <a href="2%20Tone%20Records">2 Tone Records</a> on the 40th anniversary of the record label.
Kit maker and sponsorship.
Since the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20EFL%20League%20One">2019–20</a> season, the kit is made by <a href="Hummel%20International">Hummel</a>. The home, away and third kit is sponsored by <a href="BoyleSports">BoyleSports</a>.
The first official kit manufacture deal came in 1974 when <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> signed a deal with the club. Coventry also had the first kit sponsorship deal in the football league, when Jimmy Hill, then Chairman of the club, negotiated a deal with <a href="Talbot%20%28automobile%29">Talbot</a>, who manufactured cars in the city.
Stadium.
106 years at Highfield Road.
Coventry City began playing at the <a href="Highfield%20Road">Highfield Road</a> stadium in 1899 within the Hillfields district of the city, although the club did not buy the freehold to the site until 1937.
In November 1940, the main stand which backed onto terraced houses in Mowbray Street was bombed by the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>. Heavy turnstiles from the ground and gas meters from houses in Mowbray Street were discovered in Gosford Park, some 500 metres away. Bombs also damaged the roof of the terrace at the city end of the ground and the pitch resulting in the ground being unusable for more than two years.
The record crowd at the ground was on 29 April 1967 when 51,452 watched the Second Division title decider against <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>. This was over 6,000 more than the previous record of 44,930 set against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C">Aston Villa</a> in 1938. Many people who were at the Wolves game suggest the attendance was higher, possibly over 55,000. Supporters climbed onto the roofs of the stands and up the floodlights.
In 1968, the main stand and the club’s offices suffered serious damage in a fire following a reserve game. The Second Division Championship trophy was destroyed in the fire and the club decided to demolish the stand and built its replacement within four months. Ten days after the fire the club hosted Manchester United and were able to use half the stand. The game attracted the club’s second highest attendance of all time (47,111).
In 1981, Highfield Road was converted into England's first-ever <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a> with a capacity of around 24,500, which many criticised as killing the atmosphere of the ground. Some seats were removed a few years later. It had been gradually upgraded since then, with the final phase of work being completed in the mid-1990s, including two fully enclosed corners, providing some much-needed modernity. On 30 April 2005, the final game played at the stadium was against Midlands rivals <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>; Coventry won 6–2. The stadium was subsequently demolished and replaced by a housing development.
Coventry Building Society Arena.
For the 2005–06 season, Coventry City moved to the new 32,609-capacity <a href="Coventry%20Building%20Society%20Arena">Coventry Building Society Arena</a> (then named the Ricoh Arena) after 106 years at Highfield Road. In 1998, the club had decided that it was time to relocate to a new stadium in the Rowleys Green area of the city, north of the city centre and close to junction 3 of the <a href="M6%20motorway">M6 motorway</a>. The original plan was for a state-of-the-art, 45,000-seater multipurpose stadium with removable pitch and retractable roof. It was due to be ready for the 2001–02 season and was touted to be one of the finest and most advanced stadiums in Europe. However, the club's subsequent relegation, financial problems, financier/contractor withdrawals, and England's failure to secure the 2006 World Cup competition led to a radical redesign. The resulting stadium was built to a standard bowl design with steep stands in line with several other new stadia built during that period. It has excellent acoustics and has been used to host several major rock concerts.
Despite initiating the project and being the principal attraction there, Coventry City's financial situation means that it no longer owned the stadium and must pay rent to use it; this appeared to raise concerns over the managing of the club's finances by previous club officials, because in 2001 the club was the fourth-longest serving club in the top flight of English football. The stadium naming rights were originally sold to <a href="Jaguar%20Cars">Jaguar Cars</a>, which has strong links with Coventry. Jaguar pulled out of the project on 16 December 2004 and a new major sponsor was needed. A £10 million deal, which included naming rights, was signed and electronics manufacturer <a href="Ricoh">Ricoh</a> became the new chief sponsor for the stadium. The project was funded largely by <a href="Coventry%20City%20Council">Coventry City Council</a> and the (Alan Edward) Higgs Charity (of which former CCFC and ACL director the late Sir <a href="Derek%20Higgs">Derek Higgs</a> was a trustee), and includes shopping facilities, a casino, exhibition halls and a concert venue.
At the beginning of the 2005–06 season, construction delays at the ground forced Coventry City to play their first three games of the season away and postpone their home games. On Saturday 20 August 2005, City hosted <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> in the first-ever game at the Ricoh Arena; Coventry won the game 3–0. On 28 July 2011, a statue of <a href="Jimmy%20Hill">Jimmy Hill</a> was installed at the main entrance to the Ricoh Arena, with Hill appearing in person to unveil it.
Sixfields.
On 3 May 2013, Coventry City put a contingency plan in place to play elsewhere for the 2013–14 season. It was argued by the club that this was due to ACL (Arena Coventry Limited), which managed the stadium, being unwilling to negotiate with the club to agree to a new lease. However, that led to the local newspaper, the "<a href="Coventry%20Telegraph">Coventry Telegraph</a>", starting a petition to stop Coventry City from playing outside of Coventry. It was sent to all 72 clubs in the Football League and Football League chairman <a href="Greg%20Clarke">Greg Clarke</a>. In May 2013, managing director Tim Fisher set a plan of building a new stadium within the city over the next three years, and ground-sharing whilst the new ground was being built. In June 2013, ACL made an offer that Coventry City F.C. could play at the Ricoh Arena rent free while the club was in administration.
It was believed that Coventry City might ground-share with <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> at the <a href="Bescot%20Stadium">Bescot Stadium</a> or attempt to stay at the Ricoh Arena, following the appointment of new owners. However, by July 2013, the <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> rumours were denied and the club ground-shared at <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a>'s <a href="Sixfields%20Stadium">Sixfields Stadium</a> – a venue that had less than a quarter the capacity of the Ricoh Arena, and involved a round-trip of . That arrangement was due to continue until at least 2016. Plans for the club to play its home matches outside of the city were met with strong opposition, and led to protests by Coventry fans. Member of parliament for <a href="Coventry%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Coventry South</a>, <a href="Jim%20Cunningham%20%28British%20politician%29">Jim Cunningham</a>, described the move as "a disgrace".
Return to the Coventry Building Society Arena.
On 21 August 2014 it was announced that an agreement had been reached allowing the club to return to the Ricoh Arena for the next two years with the option of another two years. Coventry City's first home game back at the Ricoh Arena was played against <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> on 5 September 2014. Steve Waggott, who led the negotiations for the club, said: "We are delighted to get this deal done and I am sure every supporter of Coventry City will be thrilled with the news." City won their first match back at the Ricoh Arena 1–0 with <a href="Frank%20Nouble">Frank Nouble</a> scoring the only goal of the match in front of 27,306 supporters.
The return followed a social media campaign entitled #bringCityhome by the "<a href="Coventry%20Telegraph">Coventry Telegraph</a>" and a protest march by the Sky Blue Trust supporters' group. The campaign drew praise from national media and figures within the football world. It was short-listed at the 2014 <a href="British%20Press%20Awards">British Press Awards</a> in the "Campaign of the Year" category.
Because the tenancy agreement with Wasps was to expire in August 2018, it was reported in November 2015 that there would be a relocation to another site within the city. However it was later confirmed that Coventry City would remain at the Ricoh Arena for another year.
In May 2016 the "<a href="Coventry%20Telegraph">Coventry Telegraph</a>" broke the news that the club had drawn up plans with <a href="Coventry%20R.F.C.">Coventry Rugby Club</a> for a ground-share arrangement at a redeveloped <a href="Butts%20Park%20Arena">Butts Park Arena</a>. That was eventually denied by Rugby Club chairman Jon Sharp, who said there could be no deal with the football club while it was still owned by SISU.
St Andrew's.
On 7 June 2019 it was reported that talks between SISU and Wasps had again broken down meaning that Coventry would have to play their <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20EFL%20League%20One">2019–20</a> home matches at <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City's</a> <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20%28stadium%29">St Andrew's</a> ground.
The club had the option to spend a further two seasons away from Coventry and remained at St Andrew's for the 2020–21 season. The club returned to the Coventry Building Society Arena in August 2021, ending the ground-share agreement between Coventry and Birmingham.
New Stadium at the University of Warwick and second return to Coventry.
In July 2020, the club confirmed that they had commenced a partnership with the <a href="University%20of%20Warwick">University of Warwick</a> which would see land provided for a new stadium.
In March 2021, the club announced that they had secured a ten-year agreement to return to the Ricoh Arena from the start of the 2021–22 season. The deal, described by the club's owners as "the best the club has had in terms of commercial revenue" during their time at the stadium, would not affect the longer-term goal of constructing a new stadium. The new deal also included a seven-year break clause should the club require it.
On 5 May 2021, it was announced that the Ricoh Arena would be renamed for the first time, when it would become the <a href="Coventry%20Building%20Society">Coventry Building Society</a> Arena. The name change came into effect in July 2021 as a part of a 10-year naming rights deal with the <a href="building%20society">building society</a>.
On 8 August 2021, Coventry City played Nottingham Forest at the Coventry Building Society Arena in the club's first game back at the ground in 2 years and their first Championship game in Coventry since 2012. They won the match 2–1. On 16 September 2021, Coventry City owner Joy Seppala told the BBC the club remained "firmly committed" to a new stadium, planned for a site owned by the University of Warwick.
The club were forced to move at least 1 match away from Coventry again in August 2022 when their <a href="EFL%20Cup">EFL Cup</a> match against <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> was held at <a href="Burton%20Albion%20F.C.">Burton Albion</a>'s <a href="Pirelli%20Stadium">Pirelli Stadium</a> due to the pitch being deemed "unsafe".
Arena Coventry entered Administration in November 2022 and was subsequently bought by <a href="Frasers%20Group">Frasers Group</a>. Coventry City did not sign to continue the previous deal with the new owners and were issued a notice of eviction on 5 December unless they signed a new deal which only ran until May 2023. The new deal was signed on 13 December meaning the Sky Blues would remain at the CBS Arena only until at least May 2023. The deal was subsequently extended by 5 years; additional guarantees in the lease included that City would be the sole tenant of the CBS Arena throughout the lease, would move back into the original home dressing room (previously used by Wasps), a new club shop, and enhanced Sky Blues branding in the concourse.
Supporters.
Former Players' Association.
In February 2007 a Former Players' Association was launched. Set up by club historian and statistician Jim Brown, former 1980s player <a href="Kirk%20Stephens">Kirk Stephens</a> and a committee of volunteers, its aim was to bring former players of the club together and cherish their memories. To qualify for membership players have to have made at least one first-team competitive appearance for the club or been a manager.
Around 50 former stars of the club attended the launch including Coventry City legends <a href="George%20Hudson%20%28footballer%29">George Hudson</a>, <a href="Cyrille%20Regis">Cyrille Regis</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Timmins">Charlie Timmins</a> and <a href="Bill%20Glazier">Bill Glazier</a>. The association's first newsletter was published in autumn 2007 and a website launched. The launch of 2007 was followed by subsequent Legends' Days. The 2009 event, held at the home game against <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers">Doncaster Rovers</a> was attended by 43 former players including the first visit to Coventry for many years of <a href="Roy%20Barry">Roy Barry</a> and <a href="Dave%20Clements">Dave Clements</a>. In March 2012 the membership had increased past the 200 mark with former captain <a href="Terry%20Yorath">Terry Yorath</a> inducted as the 200th member at the 2012 Legends' Day.
Legends’ Day has become an almost permanent fixture amongst Coventry supporters. Legends’ Day has been held almost every year since the Inaugural Event. The only exceptions being in 2014 when the club were exiled playing home games in Northampton and in 2020 and 2021 after fans were shut out of stadiums as a result of the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 Pandemic</a>.
Identity
The club’s support is collectively known as The Sky Blue Army. In Coventry and Warwickshire the use of the term ‘Going Up The City’ is a term used to say you are going to watch a Coventry City match.
The club’s support massively dropped off in the years of the SISU ownership, with the decline in average attendances falling in line with the club’s slide down the league pyramid. The exit from The Ricoh Arena in 2013 led to many supporters protesting against SISU’s ownership of the club and a section of the support enforce a ‘Not One Penny More’ policy in which its backers vowed not to give any more money to the club as long as SISU remained in charge.
In the 2013–14 season, in which the club was exiled at Northampton Town’s Sixfields Stadium the average attendance dropped to just over 2,000.
The Sky Blue Trust is the largest member-based supporters club and in its peak was fighting to gain a stake in the club and to get fan representation on the board of directors. As of 2022 The Sky Blue Trust are less vocal and are viewed as obsolete by many supporters.
Sky Blue anthem.
The words to the club's song were written in 1962 by Team Manager <a href="Jimmy%20Hill">Jimmy Hill</a> and Director John Camkin; The words being set to the tune of the <a href="Eton%20Boating%20Song">Eton Boating Song</a>. It was launched at the home game with Colchester on 22 December 1962 (a match abandoned at half-time because of fog) with the words printed in the programme. It quickly became popular with supporters during the epic FA Cup run in 1963 when the then Third Division team reached the quarter-finals of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> before losing to eventual winners <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>:

Rivalries.
<a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> are considered Coventry City's main rival and the two clubs compete the <a href="M69%20derby">M69 Derby</a>. However, largely due to the clubs' differing fortunes meetings between the two have been rare in recent years; the two clubs had not played each other between 2012 and 2023. The derby returned for the first time in eleven years in the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20EFL%20Championship">2023–24</a> <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a> season, following Leicester's relegation from the Premier League. A small section of The Sky Blues' support were widely condemned in the build up to an M69 Derby in January 2024, after offensive banners mocking the death of former Foxes owner <a href="Vichai%20Srivaddhanaprabha">Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha</a> were displayed across the City of Coventry
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s and to the turn of the millennium, <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> were considered Coventry's main rivals as they continually competed against each other in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> and then the Premier League. The two clubs however have not met since Coventry's relegation from the Premier League in 2001.
In the 1960s and 1970s there was intense rivalry with <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> which started in 1965 after Wolves were relegated from Division One and the two clubs met in Division Two. The two sides were promoted together in 1967 and there were fierce battles in both city centres when the clubs met during the period. There was also rivalries with <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> and <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> but these are much less fierce than the ones with Leicester, Wolves and Villa.
A local rivalry also exists with <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>, however the ground share agreement at <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20%28stadium%29">St Andrew's</a> between 2019 and 2021 – which effectively spared Coventry from being expelled from the <a href="English%20Football%20League">EFL</a> – has led to friendlier relations between the two clubs’ supporters.
The club has an unusual long-distance rivalry with North-East side <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, which stems back to the end of the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77 season</a>, when Coventry, Sunderland and <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> were all battling against relegation from <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> on the final day of the season. With Coventry and Bristol City facing each other at <a href="Highfield%20Road">Highfield Road</a>, the referee, on the advice of the police, delayed the kick-off of the match by 15 minutes as many Bristol fans were still trying to enter the ground and there was a risk of serious trouble. Sunderland, who were playing away to Everton at the same time, lost 2–0, and the result was displayed on the Highfield Road scoreboard. There were still 15 minutes left to play and Coventry and Bristol City effectively stopped playing knowing that a 2–2 draw would keep both teams up and send Sunderland down. There was an inquiry but the result was allowed to stand and Sunderland were relegated. Some Sunderland fans have held a grudge, believing that then-Coventry chairman <a href="Jimmy%20Hill">Jimmy Hill</a> used his influence to delay the game and give his side an advantage, and there has been some rivalry more recently as the two clubs competed for promotion from <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> together in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20EFL%20League%20One">2018–19</a> and <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20EFL%20League%20One">2019–20</a>. In 2018–19 crowd trouble marred the meetings between the two at <a href="Coventry%20Building%20Society%20Arena">The Ricoh Arena</a> and <a href="Stadium%20of%20Light">The Stadium of Light</a> leading to numerous arrests among both sets of fans.

AFC Bournemouth

AFC Bournemouth ( ) is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Kings%20Park%2C%20Boscombe">Kings Park, Boscombe</a>, a suburb of <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, England. The club competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the highest division of English club football. Formed in 1899 as Boscombe, the club adopted their current name in 1971. Nicknamed "The Cherries", Bournemouth have played their home games at <a href="Dean%20Court">Dean Court</a> since 1910. Their home colours are red-and-black striped shirts which have been a tradition dating back to the club's establishment.
The club competed in regional football leagues before going up from the <a href="Hampshire%20League">Hampshire League</a> to the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> in 1920. Now known as Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, they were elected into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1923. They remained in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> for 35 years, winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South%20Cup">Third Division South Cup</a> in 1946. Placed in the newly reorganised <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> in 1958, they suffered relegation in 1970, but would win an immediate promotion in 1970–71. Relegated back into the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> in 1975, Bournemouth were promoted again in 1981–82 and after lifting the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Associate Members' Cup</a> in <a href="1984%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup%20Final">1984</a> would go on to win the Third Division title in 1986–87. They spent three seasons in the second tier but entered <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> in 1997 and ended up back in the fourth tier with relegation in 2002, though immediately gained promotion by winning the play-offs in <a href="2003%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20play-off%20Final">2003</a>.
Bournemouth entered administration for a second time and were relegated back into <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> in 2008, but ended the year by appointing <a href="Eddie%20Howe">Eddie Howe</a> as manager. Under Howe's stewardship, Bournemouth won three promotions in six years to win a place in the first tier of English football for the first time in their history. This was achieved with a second-place finish in League Two in 2009–10, a second-place finish in <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> in 2012–13 and a <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> title in 2014–15. The club remained in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> for five seasons before suffering relegation in 2020, but they returned in 2022 as Championship runners-up, this time under the management of <a href="Scott%20Parker">Scott Parker</a>.
History.
Boscombe.
Although the exact date of the club's foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. John's Institute Football Club. The club was originally known as Boscombe Football Club. The first president was Mr. J. C. Nutt.
In their first season, 1899–1900, Boscombe competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons, they played on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown. From their third season, the team played on a pitch in <a href="King%27s%20Park%2C%20Boscombe">King's Park</a>. In the 1905–06 season, Boscombe graduated to senior amateur football.
In 1910, the club was granted a long lease over some wasteland next to Kings Park as the club's football ground by local businessman J.E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive, and dominated the local football scene. The same year the club signed its first professional player <a href="Baven%20Penton">Baven Penton</a>.
Around about this time, the club obtained their nickname "The Cherries". There are two leading explanations of how the club gained the nickname: from the cherry-red striped shirts that the team played in, and, perhaps less plausible, because Dean Court was built adjacent to the Cooper-Dean estate, which, it is believed, may have contained many cherry trees.
For the first time, during the 1913–14 season, the club competed in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. The club's progress, however, was halted in 1914 with the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and Boscombe returned to the <a href="Hampshire%20League">Hampshire League</a>.
In 1920, the Third Division of the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> was formed, and Boscombe were promoted to the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>, finding moderate success.
Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic.
To make the club more representative of the district, the name was changed to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic Football Club in 1923. During the same year, the club was elected to the newly expanded <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a>. The first league match was at <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a> on 25 August 1923, which Bournemouth lost 3–1. The first league game at Dean Court was also against Swindon, where Bournemouth gained their first league point after a 0–0 draw.
Initially, Bournemouth struggled in the Football League but eventually established themselves as a Third Division club. Bournemouth remains on the records as the longest continuous members of the Third Division.
As a league club, Bournemouth had to wait until after the Second World War before winning their first trophy. This was accomplished as they beat <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> in the Third Division (South) Cup in the final at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>.
AFC Bournemouth.
The club adopted the name "AFC Bournemouth" in 1971, with the intention that the club would appear first in alphabetical lists of English clubs. A year later, the club adopted a new badge as a symbol of its progress. The stripes in the background were based on the club shirt, while in the foreground is the profile of a player heading the ball, in honour of <a href="Dickie%20Dowsett">Dickie Dowsett</a>, a prolific scorer for the club in the 1950s and 1960s.
The team's red-and-black kit, introduced in 1971, was based on the <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> strip. This was the era of <a href="Ted%20MacDougall">Ted MacDougall</a>, a prolific goalscorer who, in an FA Cup tie in November 1971, scored nine goals in an 11–0 win against <a href="Margate%20F.C.">Margate</a>.
Late 20th century.
Bournemouth recorded a famous victory over holders <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in January 1984, while they were managed by <a href="Harry%20Redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a>. The club won its second piece of silverware by winning the <a href="Associate%20Members%27%20Cup">Associate Members' Cup</a> in its <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup">inaugural season</a>, beating <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> 2–1 at Boothferry Park on 24 May 1984 in the <a href="1984%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup%20Final">final</a>.
Redknapp took Bournemouth into the second tier of the English league for the first time in their history as Third Division champions in 1987. After comfortably surviving in their first season in the Second Division, Bournemouth made a serious challenge for promotion to the top flight in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89 season</a>; they ultimately fell away after a poor run late in the season, but their eventual finish of 12th place remained their highest-ever in the Football League until the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20AFC%20Bournemouth%20season">2013–14 season</a>.
On 5 May 1990, the final day of the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1989–90 season</a>, <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> had the chance to win the Second Division and gain promotion into the First Division by beating Bournemouth at Dean Court. Some United fans had already caused trouble in the town during the morning and the atmosphere was tense as Leeds won the match by a single goal. Combined with the results of other matches, this meant that Leeds were promoted while Bournemouth were relegated. The violence and destruction by visitors to Bournemouth continued over the holiday weekend, causing more than £1 million worth of damage and injury to opposing fans and police officers. The town's "<a href="Bournemouth%20Daily%20Echo">Daily Echo</a>" newspaper reported that "spectators, including many young children, had to run to safety as missiles were hurled and riot police waded in to control the crowds." The matter was raised in Parliament by one of the town's MPs. Financially, the Leeds trouble affected the club for more than a decade, as Bournemouth were prevented by local police from staging home games on <a href="Bank%20holiday">Bank Holidays</a> (traditionally a popular day for football) until a game against <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.">Shrewsbury Town</a> on 21 April 2003.
Redknapp remained at the club for two more seasons, both of which ended with the club falling three points short of the play-offs. However, mounting financial pressures caused him to resign his position at the end of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92 season</a>, and he subsequently rejoined former club <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> as a coach. He was replaced by <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a>, who built a much cheaper squad that could only manage two consecutive 17th-place finishes before Pulis walked out of the club, blaming financial pressures.
Bournemouth went the first few months of the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95 season</a> without a permanent manager in place, and a dreadful start saw them bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season. Despite a minor upturn in form when <a href="Mel%20Machin">Mel Machin</a> was appointed as manager, they looked highly unlikely to survive, given that there were five relegation spots in Division Two for that season due to league reconstruction. However, a late run of form combined with collapses by relegation rivals <a href="Cambridge%20United%20F.C.">Cambridge United</a> and <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a> saw them survive on the last day of the season by two points.
Machin ultimately remained in charge for six years, most of which were marked by unremarkable mid-table finishes. The <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1998–99 season</a> proved to be arguably the highlight of his tenure, with the club making a serious playoff challenge for most of the season, but ultimately falling short and finishing seventh. However, a drop to 16th place in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20AFC%20Bournemouth%20season">1999–2000 season</a> followed by a poor start to the following season saw Machin removed from his position and given the role of director of football.
Early 21st century.
<a href="Sean%20O%27Driscoll">Sean O'Driscoll</a> was promoted from the coaching staff in place of Mel Machin at the start of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20AFC%20Bournemouth%20season">2000–01 season</a>. In O'Driscoll's first season as manager, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the Division Two playoffs but were relegated a year later in the new stadium (in the early part of the 2001–02 season, they played their home matches at <a href="Dorchester%20Town%20F.C.">Dorchester Town</a>'s ground while their own stadium was being redeveloped). The board kept faith in O'Driscoll and they were rewarded with promotion via the Division Three playoffs in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03</a>. The club became the first to score five goals at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> when they beat <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a> 5–2 in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03</a> Division Three play-off final with goals from <a href="Steve%20Fletcher">Steve Fletcher</a>, <a href="Carl%20Fletcher%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Carl Fletcher</a> (2), <a href="Stephen%20Purches">Stephen Purches</a> and <a href="Garreth%20O%27Connor">Garreth O'Connor</a>. Under O'Driscoll, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the play-offs for the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> and <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">2004–05</a> seasons, and just avoided relegation in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06</a> season.
Long-serving player <a href="James%20Hayter%20%28footballer%29">James Hayter</a> scored the fastest league hat-trick in English Football League history during the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> season. The Cherries were leading 3–0 against <a href="Wrexham%20F.C.">Wrexham</a> thanks to goals from Stephen Purches, <a href="Warren%20Cummings">Warren Cummings</a> and <a href="Warren%20Feeney">Warren Feeney</a> when Hayter was brought onto the field as a substitute. With 86 minutes gone, Hayter managed to net three goals in the space of two minutes and 17 seconds, making the final score 6–0 to Bournemouth.
In September 2006, with the team in eighth in the League, Sean O'Driscoll left to become manager of <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a>. He was replaced by <a href="Kevin%20Bond%20%28English%20footballer%29">Kevin Bond</a>.
Decline and administration (2008–2009).
In February 2008, Bournemouth were forced into administration, suffering a ten-point deduction which put them in relegation trouble. Bournemouth had debts of around £4 million and almost went out of business completely. The off-field uncertainty continued throughout the season, with only one, ultimately unsuccessful, bid for the club accepted, and the club ended the season being relegated to <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a>.
Ahead of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09 season</a>, the team's future in the Football League was put into doubt when the league threatened to block Bournemouth's participation in League Two, due to problems with the club's continuing administration and change in ownership. The league ordered both Bournemouth and <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a> to demonstrate that they could fulfil all of their fixtures and find a way out of administration, eventually allowing the club to compete with a 17-point penalty for failing to follow the Football League insolvency rules. The new company was also ordered to pay unsecured creditors the amount offered at the time of the original <a href="Trading%20while%20insolvent%23Company%20voluntary%20agreement">CVA</a> (around ten pence in the pound) within two years.
Early into the season, manager Bond was sacked and was replaced by former player <a href="Jimmy%20Quinn%20%28Northern%20Irish%20footballer%29">Jimmy Quinn</a>, who would himself leave the club only a few months later.
Former player <a href="Eddie%20Howe">Eddie Howe</a> took over as manager with the club still ten points adrift at the bottom of the league and initially on a caretaker basis, becoming the youngest manager in the Football League at the age of 31.
At the end of 2008, it was announced that local businessman Adam Murry had completed the purchase of 50% of the club's shares from previous chairman, Paul Baker. However, in January 2009, Murry missed the deadline to buy Baker's shares.
In the final home game of the 2008–09 season, the Cherries guaranteed their Football League status by beating <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> 2–1 with a winning goal ten minutes from time by Bournemouth's Steve Fletcher, sparking wild celebrations after a fairytale ending to "The Great Escape." They finished their troubled season with their best away win in 30 years with a 4–0 victory at <a href="Morecambe%20F.C.">Morecambe</a>.
In June 2009, a consortium including Adam Murry finally took over Bournemouth. The consortium included Jeff Mostyn, former vice-chairman Steve Sly, Neill Blake and former <a href="Dorchester%20Town">Dorchester Town</a> chairman <a href="Eddie%20Mitchell">Eddie Mitchell</a>.
Rise to the Premier League (2009–2015).
Howe's first full season in charge brought success as Bournemouth finished second in League Two to earn promotion with two games to spare. Howe subsequently left the club for <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> during the following season; his successor, another former Bournemouth player, <a href="Lee%20Bradbury">Lee Bradbury</a>, led Bournemouth to the League One play-offs. The two-legged semi-final against <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> finished 3–3 after extra time, and Huddersfield went through the final by winning the penalty shoot-out 4–2. Bradbury was unable to lead Bournemouth to another promotion challenge in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League%20One">2011–12 Football League One</a>, placing 11th after a season of indifferent results, and was replaced by youth team coach <a href="Paul%20Groves%20%28footballer%29">Paul Groves</a> for the final games of the season.
Groves remained in charge at the start of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20AFC%20Bournemouth%20season">2012–13 season</a>, only to be sacked in October 2012 following a start which left the club near the bottom of the table. Eddie Howe returned as manager, and not only did he pull the club away from their early-season relegation battle, they achieved promotion to the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>, returning to the second-tier of English football for the first time since 1990. The club also revealed a new club crest. After a promising start to life in the Championship, the club was handed a fourth Round <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> tie with <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> club <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> which ended in a 2–0 loss. Bournemouth finished their first season back in the Championship in tenth place, their highest ever position in the Football League.
On 25 October 2014, Bournemouth won 8–0 away at <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20%28stadium%29">St. Andrew's</a> against <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>. It was the first time that the Cherries had ever scored eight goals in a league game and their largest winning margin in the league (not counting a 10–0 win over <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a> in September 1939, which was discounted after the league was abandoned due to the Second World War). The club followed up this success with a 2–1 victory over <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> side <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in the League Cup, reaching the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time. Bournemouth were again drawn against Liverpool but lost 3–1. The club spent most of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20AFC%20Bournemouth%20season">2014–15 season</a> near the top of the table, and a 3–0 win away at <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> on the final day of the season was enough to clinch the Championship title and a first-ever promotion to the top flight of English football.
Premier League era (2015–2020).
In Bournemouth's <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20AFC%20Bournemouth%20season">first season</a> in the Premier League, the team was beset by a number of crippling injuries, including to <a href="Callum%20Wilson%20%28English%20footballer%29">Callum Wilson</a>, star striker from the previous season. The team struggled for most of the first half of the season but an upturn in form during the second half of the season saw a reversal of fortunes. Bournemouth eventually finished 16th in the league, avoiding relegation.
The club was widely tipped to suffer <a href="second%20season%20syndrome">second season syndrome</a>, but the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20A.F.C.%20Bournemouth%20season">2016–17 season</a> was largely successful. Despite a weak start, which saw them in the relegation zone for the first three weeks, the team quickly recovered and went on to finish 9th. Star loan player <a href="Nathan%20Ak%C3%A9">Nathan Aké</a> was signed permanently from Chelsea for a club-record fee in June 2017, reportedly in the region of £20 million. Despite another slow start in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20A.F.C.%20Bournemouth%20season">2017–18</a>, a run of good form through late December and January saw them steer clear of the relegation zone, and earn Howe his second Premier League Manager of the Month award. Bournemouth went on to gain 19 points from losing positions in the second half of the season – a Premier League record – helping the team finish in 12th place.
The <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20AFC%20Bournemouth%20season">2018–19 season</a> saw the club break their transfer record again on <a href="Jefferson%20Lerma">Jefferson Lerma</a> during the summer, and contrasting with the previous season, the club had a strong start, sitting in 6th place after the first 12 games. However, their form regressed for the remainder of the season due to many injury problems. In the end, Bournemouth finished in 14th place, securing a 5th season in the Premier League.
A bright start to the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20AFC%20Bournemouth%20season">2019–20 season</a> saw the team sitting in 7th place at the beginning of November. However, continuing injury problems and a poor run of results followed, and the club dropped into the relegation zone in January. Poor performances continued after the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20England">COVID-19 pandemic</a> had interrupted the season, with key losses to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> and <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> putting the club on the brink. Despite a 3–1 victory over <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> away at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a> on the final day, the club's relegation was confirmed because Aston Villa drew against West Ham. On 1 August 2020, Howe left the club by mutual consent, ending his 8-year second spell as manager.
Financial Fair Play violation and punishment.
In 2016, Bournemouth were found guilty of violating the Football League's Financial Fair Play regulations during 2014–15, the season it secured promotion to the Premier League. The club's over-spend broke the 'maximum deviation', with a £38.3 million financial loss in 2014–15. This followed a loss of £10.3 million in 2013–2014. The club was originally fined £7.6 million by the Football League, but subsequently negotiated a settlement with a fine of £4.75 million for breaching Financial Fair Play rules.
Relegation, promotion, managerial changes and new ownership (2020–).
On 8 August, <a href="Jason%20Tindall">Jason Tindall</a>, a former Bournemouth player and Howe's longtime assistant, was promoted to manager. Despite sitting second in mid-December, Tindall was sacked on 3 February 2021 after a run of only 1 win in 8 games, which saw the team fall to 6th in the table. He was replaced by first team coach <a href="Jonathan%20Woodgate">Jonathan Woodgate</a>, initially as caretaker. Woodgate would remain as manager for the remainder of the season, as the club finished the season in 6th and entered the playoffs, but lost 3–2 to Brentford on aggregate in the semi-final. Woodgate's contract was not renewed after the season and on 28 June 2021, former <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> manager <a href="Scott%20Parker">Scott Parker</a> was appointed as the new head coach. Parker led the club to an impressive start, going 15 games unbeaten to start the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20EFL%20Championship">2021–22 Championship season</a>, going on to clinch promotion in the penultimate match of the season, a 1–0 victory against promotion rivals <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>.
The club's return to the Premier League got off to a difficult start, however, as a breakdown in the relationship between Parker and the club and a Premier League record-equalling <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%209%E2%80%930%20AFC%20Bournemouth">9–0 defeat</a> to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> resulted in Parker's dismissal after just four league games on 30 August 2022. First team coach <a href="Gary%20O%27Neil">Gary O'Neil</a> was made interim head coach and presided over an upturn in form in his 12 games in interim charge before being appointed as the permanent head coach on 27 November 2022. 
On 13 December 2022, the club was purchased from previous owner <a href="Maxim%20Demin">Maxim Demin</a> by Black Knight Football Club, a partnership led by American businessman <a href="William%20P.%20Foley">Bill Foley</a> and Cannae Holdings. The minority ownership group is led by Hollywood actor <a href="Michael%20B.%20Jordan">Michael B. Jordan</a> and Kosmos Founder Nullah Sarker. On 19 June 2023, the club announced the departure of manager Gary O'Neil, with <a href="Andoni%20Iraola">Andoni Iraola</a> coming in to replace him.

Colours.
The team's colours have varied slightly throughout the club's history. Starting off playing in red-and-white stripes, Bournemouth have also played in all-red shirts, red with white sleeves, and mostly, since 1990, in red-and-black stripes. A predominantly red shirt was chosen for the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">2004–05</a> and <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06</a> seasons, but – due to fan demand – a return was made to the stripes for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07</a> season.

Nicknamed "The Bees", the club was founded in 1889 and played home matches at <a href="Griffin%20Park">Griffin Park</a> from 1904 before moving to the <a href="Brentford%20Community%20Stadium">Gtech Community Stadium</a> in 2020. Brentford initially played amateur football before they entered the <a href="London%20League%20%28football%29">London League</a> in 1896 and finished as runners-up of the Second Division and then the First Division to win election into the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> in 1898. They won the Southern League Second Division in 1900–01 and were elected into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1920. Brentford won the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> title in 1932–33 and the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> title in 1934–35. The club enjoyed a successful spell in the top flight of English football, reaching a peak of fifth in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, in 1935–36, their highest ever league finish, before three relegations left them in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> by 1962. They were crowned Fourth Division champions in 1962–63, but were relegated in 1966 and again in 1973 after gaining promotion in 1971–72. Brentford spent 14 seasons in the Third Division after gaining promotion in 1977–78 and went on to win the Third Division title in 1991–92, though were relegated again in 1993.
Brentford were relegated into the fourth tier in 1998 and won promotion as champions in the 1998–99 campaign. The club were relegated in 2007 and won promotion as champions of <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> in 2008–09 and then were promoted out of <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> in 2013–14. They had unsuccessful Championship play-off campaigns in 2015 and 2020. Brentford have a poor record in finals, finishing as runners-up in three <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Associate Members' Cup/Football League Trophy</a> finals (<a href="1985%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup%20Final">1985</a>, <a href="2001%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">2001</a> and <a href="2011%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">2011</a>) and losing four play-off finals (the <a href="1997%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20final">1997 Second Division final</a>, <a href="2002%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20final">2002 Second Division final</a>, <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">2013 League One final</a> and <a href="2020%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2020 Championship final</a>).

History.
1889–1920: Formation and early years.
In 1889, the town of <a href="Brentford">Brentford</a>, <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a> was home to the Brentford <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29">Rowing</a> Club and <a href="Boston%20Manor%20Park">Boston Park</a> <a href="Cricket">Cricket</a> Club. Attempts to form <a href="Association%20football">football</a> and <a href="Rugby%20union">rugby</a> clubs in the town fell by the wayside until a new recreation ground was opened on 17 October 1889. Seven days earlier, a meeting had taken place at the Oxford & Cambridge <a href="pub">pub</a> near <a href="Kew%20Bridge">Kew Bridge</a>, during which it had been endeavoured between the rowing and cricket club members to decide how best to use the recreation ground. On 16 October 1889, the rowing club members again met at the Oxford & Cambridge pub and it was voted that the new club would play association football, be named "Brentford Football Club".
On 26 October 1889, the club staged its first practice match and on 23 November the club's first competitive match was played versus Kew, which resulted in a 1–1 draw. The <a href="1892%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1892–93</a> season saw Brentford enter a league for the first time – the West London Alliance. The 1894–95 season was when Brentford first got their nickname, The Bees. A group of people from <a href="West%20London%20Institute%20of%20Higher%20Education">Borough Road College</a> had come to a match to support their friend <a href="Joseph%20Gettins">Joseph Gettins</a> who was playing for Brentford at the time. They shouted their school chant, 'Buck up Bs!' but it was misheard by the media as 'Buck up bees!', and the name stuck.
Brentford continued to largely play cup and friendly matches until 1896, when the club was elected into the Second Division of the <a href="London%20League%20%28football%29">London League</a>. The Bees finished second to secure promotion to the First Division. Brentford's London League exploits and its establishment as one of the top amateur clubs in <a href="London">London</a> led to the club's election into the Second Division (London section) of the Southern League for the <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1898–99</a> season. The club became a professional outfit in the <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1899–1900</a> season and won a place in the top-flight in July 1901 after <a href="Gravesend%20United%20F.C.">Gravesend United</a> dropped out of the Southern League.
Brentford moved to <a href="Griffin%20Park">Griffin Park</a>, its first permanent home, in time for the beginning of the <a href="1904%E2%80%9305%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1904–05</a> season. The Bees reached the FA Cup first round proper for the first time in <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1905–06</a>, advancing to the third round before succumbing to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>. Despite an initial upturn in form, 9 defeats in the final 11 matches of <a href="1912%E2%80%9313%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1912–13</a> led to Brentford's relegation after an 11-season stay in the First Division.
In July 1915, the Southern League cancelled its competition for the duration of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. Brentford competed in the <a href="London%20Combination">London Combination</a> during the War. The squad was decimated by the call-up of players for service or war work. Brentford won the London Combination title in 1918–19, four points ahead of nearest challengers <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. Brentford turned down the opportunity to apply for election to the Football League for the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1919–20</a> season and instead applied for election to the First Division of the Southern League, which was awarded, finishing 15th.
1920–1954: Establishment in the Football League and glory years.
In May 1920, Brentford and 20 other Southern League First Division clubs were elected into the Football League as founder members of the Third Division for the <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1920–21</a> season. 11 new players were signed and the Bees' first-ever Football League match took place on 28 August 1920 at <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a>'s <a href="St%20James%20Park%20%28Exeter%29">St James Park</a>, which resulted in a 3–0 defeat. Despite 18 goals from <a href="Harry%20King%20%28footballer%29">Harry King</a>, a lack of goals from elsewhere in the side led Brentford to a 21st-place finish, but the club were <a href="Re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-elected</a> into the league without going to a poll.
It was all change at Griffin Park during the 1926 off-season, with former <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> boss <a href="Harry%20Curtis%20%28football%20manager%29">Harry Curtis</a> being installed as manager. Just 9 members of the previous season's squad were retained, but despite mid-table finishes over the following three seasons, Curtis slowly rebuilt the squad. The <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1929–30</a> <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> season provided the foundation for the Bees' future success, however, the club missed out on promotion to <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a>. The Bees romped to the <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1932–33</a> Third Division South title, with <a href="Jack%20Holliday">Jack Holliday</a> scoring a club-record 39 goals.
After topping the table for the third time in the <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1934–35</a> season on 2 March 1935, the Bees would not again relinquish top spot, cruising to the title and promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> for the first time in the club's history. Brentford also completed a unique double by winning the <a href="London%20Challenge%20Cup">London Challenge Cup</a>. After having risen from the third-tier to the first in the space of just three seasons, manager Harry Curtis elected to keep his squad intact for the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1935–36</a> First Division season. An extension to the New Road terrace increased Griffin Park's capacity to 40,000, which would generate extra income. After 15 matches, Brentford looked certain to be relegated, however, the club completed a remarkable turnaround, with the Bees losing just two of the final 23 matches and finishing in the club's all-time-highest position of 5th. Brentford again performed above expectations during the <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1936–37</a> and <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1937–38</a> seasons, finishing 6th in each campaign and reaching the FA Cup sixth round for the first time in the latter. The club reached its zenith between October 1937 and February 1938, holding onto top spot in the First Division for 17 consecutive matches.
The <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1938–39</a> season was the beginning of the end of Brentford's peak; narrowly avoiding relegation. The <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1939–40</a> season lasted just three matches before <a href="World%20War%20II%23War%20breaks%20out%20in%20Europe%20%281939%E2%80%9340%29">World War Two</a> brought about the suspension of competitive football. Brentford competed in the <a href="Football%20League%20South">Football League South</a> and the London War League during the war years, with much of the team supplemented by guests and young amateurs, though the core of the pre-war team continued to play in the majority of the club's matches. On 30 May 1942, the Bees earned a 2–0 victory over <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> in the <a href="London%20War%20Cup">London War Cup</a> final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>.
Brentford's <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1946–47</a> squad, for the first competitive season after the Second World War, was propped up by the ageing core of the 1939–40 pre-war squad which would lead to the Bees' relegation from the First Division. After narrowly avoiding a second successive relegation in <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1947–48</a>, manager Harry Curtis announced that the <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1948–49</a> season would be his last in the job after nearly 23 years. The season ended with a poor 18th-place finish, though notably the FA Cup sixth round fixture at home to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> set a new club-record attendance of 38,678. In <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1953–54</a> Brentford's relegation to the Third Division South was confirmed on the final day of the season after a 3–1 defeat to Leicester City at Griffin Park.
1954–1986: Decline and financial difficulties.
Relegation to the Third Division South at the end of the 1953–54 season meant that <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1954–55</a> would be Brentford's first in the bottom-tier for 21 years. After three consecutive top-six finishes, the rot set in during the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1960–61</a> season, with the poor form on the field mirrored by the news from the boardroom of debts of £50,000 (equivalent to £ in 2024).
After the sale of several key players, the Bees finished second-from-bottom of the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1961–62</a> Third Division and were relegated, starting several yo-yo years between the Third and Fourth divisions. Despite winning just seven of the final 14 matches of the season, Brentford finished <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1962–63</a> as Fourth Division champions. However, in <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1965–66</a>, <a href="Billy%20Gray%20%28footballer%29">Billy Gray</a> couldn't prevent relegation to the Fourth Division. In December 1966, it was revealed by chairman Dunnett at Brentford's <a href="Annual%20general%20meeting">AGM</a> that the club had lost £20,000 during the previous <a href="financial%20year">financial year</a> and that he would be selling his stake in the club. Earlier that month, there had been an approach from neighbours <a href="QPR">QPR</a>, suggesting that the two clubs share Griffin Park. On 19 January 1967, the news broke that Dunnett and his QPR counterpart <a href="Jim%20Gregory%20%28football%20chairman%29">Jim Gregory</a> had reached an agreement that Brentford's rivals would move into Griffin Park, Rangers' ground <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a> would be redeveloped as housing and Brentford, as a club, would cease to exist.
After a tense month of fan protests, negotiations and donations amounting to £8,500 (equivalent to £ in 2024), a six-man <a href="syndicate">syndicate</a> headed by former Plymouth Argyle chairman Ron Blindell took over Dunnett's shares on 23 February 1967 and guaranteed a 12-month bridging loan of £104,000. The following day, Blindell, as chairman, took control of the club. It transpired that QPR chairman Jim Gregory had resurrected his interest in Griffin Park and offered £250,000 for the use of the ground, a fee that would wipe out Brentford's £135,000 debt instantly, if the club moved to Hillingdon. The name "Brentford Borough FC" had already been chosen for the new Hillingdon-based club, but once again Brentford was saved at the eleventh hour, with former director Walter Wheatley granting the club a £69,000 interest-free loan, repayable in 12 months.
Under <a href="Frank%20Blunstone">Frank Blunstone</a>, Brentford secured promotion back to the Third Division with two matches of the season remaining. However, the Bees were relegated on the final day of the 1972–73 season. After a period of consolidation, <a href="Bill%20Dodgin%20Jr.">Bill Dodgin Jr.</a> led Brentford to a 4th-place finish and promotion to the Third Division in the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1977–78</a> season. Brentford reached its first major competitive cup final in the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1984–85</a> season, but lost 3–1 against <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> in the <a href="1985%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">1985 Football League Trophy final</a> at Wembley Stadium. In the 1988–89 season, the Bees' reached the sixth round of the FA Cup, which ended after a 4–0 defeat to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>.
1986–2014.
In <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1991–92</a>, six wins from the six final matches saw Brentford recover to win the Third Division championship on the final day and secure second-tier football for the first time since the 1953–54 season. However, Brentford returned immediately to the third tier. In 1996–97, Brentford missed out on promotion, losing the <a href="1997%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a> against <a href="Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.">Crewe Alexandra</a>. In the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1997–98</a> season, Brentford were relegated to the Third Division on the final day of the season.
In June 1998, former Crystal Palace chairman <a href="Ron%20Noades">Ron Noades</a> assumed ownership of Brentford and made wholesale changes throughout the club, installing himself as chairman-manager. The Bees won the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1998–99</a> Third Division championship on the final day, after beating <a href="Cambridge%20United%20F.C.">Cambridge United</a> 1–0 in a "winner takes all" match at the <a href="Abbey%20Stadium">Abbey Stadium</a>. Brentford reached the <a href="2001%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20final">2001 Football League Trophy final</a>, but were defeated 2–1 by <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a>. At the end of the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">2001–02</a> season, Brentford narrowly missed out on automatic promotion on the final day to <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>. The Bees could only manage a draw in a must win match, before later losing the <a href="2002%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20final">2002 play-off final</a>, to <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a>, 2–0.
In the wake of the <a href="ITV%20Digital%23Administration">ITV Digital collapse</a>, the financial restraints placed on the club by Noades left new manager <a href="Wally%20Downes">Wally Downes</a> with an inexperienced squad and <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> was narrowly avoided in August 2002. Noades quit the club and handed control to supporters' trust Bees United. Brentford narrowly avoided relegation at the end of the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">2003–04</a> season. In both <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">2004–05</a> and <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">2005–06</a>, Brentford reached the FA Cup fifth round and the play-off semi-finals. In 2006, Matthew Benham made his first interaction with Brentford, donating £500,000. He was anonymous and was known as the 'Mysterious Investor'. Despite a good start to the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">2006–07</a> season, Brentford's relegation was confirmed on 9 April 2007, eventually finishing bottom of the league. Despite the relegation, the club's finances had been improved after Matthew Benham paid nearly £3 million to take over some of the club's debts in January 2007.
In July 2009, Benham and Bees United made a deal under the codename 'Gecko' in which he agreed to give £1m every year for 5 years, in return for increasing his equity to 35% and have an option to become the owner of Brentford by 2014. Under <a href="Andy%20Scott%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201972%29">Andy Scott</a>, the Bees won the League Two title after victory in the penultimate match of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">2009–10</a> season. <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">2010–11</a> became memorable for Brentford's cup exploits, going on a run to the fourth round of the League Cup and reaching the <a href="2011%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20final">2011 Football League Trophy final</a>, which was lost 1–0 to <a href="Carlisle%20United%20F.C.">Carlisle United</a>. In June 2012, Benham fully bought the club from Bees United. However, Bees United still keep a place on the club board. Brentford came within a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a> of automatic promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a> on the final day of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">2012–13</a> season, losing 1–0 to promotion rivals <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a> at Griffin Park, who only needed a draw to secure automatic promotion. The Bees would eventually lose to <a href="Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.">Yeovil Town</a> in the <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20One%20play-off%20final">play-off final</a>. Despite a poor start to the season, Mark Warburton led the Bees to automatic promotion to the Championship in 2014.
2014–present: Rise to the Premier League.
In their first season in the second tier since 1993, Brentford finished 5th but lost to <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> in the play-off semi-finals. Under <a href="Dean%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201971%29">Dean Smith</a>, Brentford became an established Championship side. Smith's successor, <a href="Thomas%20Frank%20%28football%20manager%29">Thomas Frank</a> took Brentford to the <a href="2020%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2020 Championship play-off final</a> after finishing third in the league, but lost 2–1 to West London rivals <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>. During the 2020 off-season, the club moved out of Griffin Park (its home ground for 116 years) and into the <a href="Brentford%20Community%20Stadium">Brentford Community Stadium</a>, a 17,250-capacity <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a>. Brentford repeated their third-place finish during the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">2020–21</a> regular season and went one better in the <a href="2021%20English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-offs</a>, securing promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> with a 2–0 victory over <a href="Swansea%20City%20F.C.">Swansea City</a> in the <a href="2021%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2021 Championship play-off final</a>. Brentford played in the top division of <a href="English%20Football%20League">English football</a> for the first time in 74 years. Frank guided his side to 13th and 9th-placed finishes in Brentford's first two Premier League campaigns.
"As of 5 December 2022"
Nickname.
Brentford's nickname is "The Bees". The nickname was unintentionally created by students of <a href="Borough%20Road%23History%20of%20education%20on%20Borough%20Road">Borough Road College</a> in the 1890s, when they attended a match and shouted the college's chant "buck up Bs" in support of their friend and then-Brentford player <a href="Joseph%20Gettins">Joseph Gettins</a>. Local newspapers misheard the chant as "Buck up Bees" and the nickname stuck.
Colours and badge.
Brentford's predominant home colours are a red and white striped shirt, black shorts and red or black socks. These have been the club's predominant home colours since the <a href="1925%E2%80%9326%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1925–26</a> season, bar one season – <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1960–61</a> – when yellow (gold) and blue were used, unsuccessfully. The colours on entering the Football League, in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1920–21</a>, were white shirts, navy shorts and navy socks. Away kits have varied over the years, with the current colours being a sky blue shirt, navy shorts and sky blue socks. It features the popular 'castle' badge of the 1970s and 80's.
Brentford have had several badges on their shirts since it was formed in 1889. The first one, in 1893, was a white shield, with 'BFC' in blue and a wavy line in blue, which is thought to represent the river and the rowing club, who founded the football club. The next known badge, the Middlesex County Arms, was on shirts donated by a club supporter in 1909. The Brentford and Chiswick arms, as a badge, was used just for the one season, in <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1938–39</a>. The next badge was in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1971–72</a> when a shield, formed into quadrants, which had a hive and bees in one, 3 seaxes in another and the other two with red and white stripes. In 1972, the club organised a competition to design a new crest, which was won by Mr B.G. Spencer's design, a circle with a bee and stripes and the founding date of 1888. This was introduced in 1973 and used until May 1975, when it was brought to the club's attention, via Graham Haynes, that the club was formed in 1889 and not in 1888. Therefore, a new badge, reputedly designed by <a href="Dan%20Tana">Dan Tana</a> – the club's chairman at the time – was introduced for the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Brentford%20F.C.%20season">1975–76</a> season and continued until 1994 when the current badge was introduced. In 2011 <a href="Russell%20Grant">Russell Grant</a> claimed to have designed the badge in a BBC interview; however, it was in fact designed in 1993 for two season tickets by supporter Andrew Henning, following a request from Keith Loring, the then chief executive. In 2017, the club redesigned its crest to a more modern, uncluttered, design with the flexibility for use in two tone colour print. The design is a double roundel with the club name and year founded in white on a red background and a large central bee.
Rivalries.
Brentford's main rivals are <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Fulham. In the past this fixture has been marred by crowd violence. Brentford's rivalry with Queens Park Rangers intensified in 1967, when Rangers failed in an attempted takeover of the Bees, a move which, had it succeeded, would have seen Rangers move into Griffin Park and Brentford quit the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a>. As with the Fulham and Chelsea rivalries, this fixture sees passions run high amongst both sets of supporters with local pride at stake.
International links.
In February 2013, it was announced that Brentford had entered into partnership with Icelandic <a href="1.%20deild%20karla%20%28football%29">1. deild karla</a> club <a href="UMF%20Selfoss">UMF Selfoss</a>, which would enable Brentford to send youth and development squad players to <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> to gain experience. The partnership also sees the two clubs exchanging coaching philosophies and allows Brentford to utilise UMF Selfoss' scouting network. In May 2013, the Brentford staff forged links with <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>n lower league club <a href="Gulu%20United%20FC">Gulu United</a> as part of the "United for United" project, aimed at forming the region's first youth training camp and identifying talented players. Brentford owner Matthew Benham became majority shareholder in <a href="Football%20in%20Denmark">Danish</a> club <a href="FC%20Midtjylland">FC Midtjylland</a> in 2014 and the staff of both clubs share ideas. In 2023, Benham sold <a href="FC%20Midtjylland">FC Midtjylland</a> to Danish billionaire <a href="Anders%20Holch%20Povlsen">Anders Holch Povlsen</a>, therefore, they are now no longer sister clubs.

Oldham Athletic A.F.C.

Oldham Athletic Association Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club in <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, Greater Manchester, England. The team compete in the <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">National League</a>, the fifth level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>, as of the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20National%20League%20%28division%29">2023–24 season</a>. 
The <a href="history%20of%20Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">history of Oldham Athletic</a> began with the founding of Pine Villa F.C. in 1895, a team that played in the Manchester and Lancashire leagues. When neighbours Oldham County folded in 1899, Pine Villa moved into their stadium and changed their name to Oldham Athletic. They won the <a href="Lancashire%20Combination">Lancashire Combination</a> title in 1906–07 and were elected into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a>. They won <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> out of the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in 1909–10 and went on to finish second in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1914–15, before being <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> in 1923. Another relegation in 1935 left them in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a>, which they won at the end of the 1952–53 campaign, only to be relegated back into the following year. Placed in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>, they secured promotion in 1962–63, and again in 1970–71 after another relegation in 1969.
<a href="Jimmy%20Frizzell">Jimmy Frizzell</a> managed the club from 1970 to 1982 and under his leadership, Oldham won the Third Division title in 1973–74. He was succeeded by <a href="Joe%20Royle">Joe Royle</a>, who also had a 12-year spell in charge, during which time Oldham reached the <a href="1990%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">League Cup final in 1990</a>, before winning the Second Division title in 1990–91, which took them back into the top-flight for the first time in 68 years. Oldham were founder members of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992, but were relegated two years later and fell to the third tier by 1997. The club ended a 21-season-long stay in the third tier – which encompassed numerous financial crises – with relegation out of <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> in 2018. At the end of the 2021–22 season, relegation from <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> was confirmed and the club fell into the <a href="National%20League%20%28English%20football%29">National League</a>, becoming the first former Premier League team to play <a href="non-League%20football">non-League football</a>.
They play home matches at <a href="Boundary%20Park">Boundary Park</a>. Known as "Latics", Oldham traditionally play in blue shirts. The club contests numerous local rivalries, most notably with <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a>, <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, the latter of which is known as the Roses Derby.
History.
Early history.
In July 1895, licensee John Garland with his son formed a football club named Pine Villa Football Club with a group of friends inside the Featherstall & Junction Inn. The club was initially named after the Pine Mill whose shadow the club played in. The term Villa is thought to have originated due to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>'s dominance at the time of formation. The club changed its appearance and name in 1899 to Oldham Athletic Football Club. The club immediately gained professional status and played in both the <a href="Lancashire%20Combination">Lancashire Combination</a> and <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28football%29">Lancashire League</a>. Unlike many clubs, Oldham Athletic gained quick success and gained acceptance into <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> in 1907–08. After three years in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, Latics gained promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>.
Within a couple of seasons, Oldham had announced themselves serious contenders, finishing 4th in the league in 1912–13, and reaching the F.A. Cup semi-finals the same season, losing out 1–0 versus Aston Villa. In 1914–15, Latics reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup but were knocked out once again after a 0–3 <a href="replay%20%28sports%29">replay</a> against <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>. In the league that season they almost won it all; Latics lost the league by one point, as close as they have ever come to winning the league. Latics early success was only halted by the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.
Interwar struggles.
Following the return of competitive football after the First World War, Oldham Athletic struggled to find their early success before they returned to the Second Division in 1923 – it would be another 68 years before they played top division football again.
Many of the players from their former squads had either retired from football or had been killed in the war. Their highest success came in the 1929–30 season as they finished in 3rd, missing out on promotion by finishing two points behind <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> From then on they slowly but surely fell down the league table, until a final placing of 21st at the end of the 1934–35 season saw them relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division North</a>. They found life in this new division much more to their liking, coming 7th in their first season and following this with three seasons in the top five. Promotion back to the Second Division looked like it might just be a possibility, but the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> in 1939 brought an end to League Football. Players' contracts were terminated, and relying largely on guest players, the club was to play in the war-time Northern League until August 1946.
Post-war plight.
Following the return of competitive football there was to be no immediate success for Oldham Athletic. They finished 19th in the first league season after the war and manager Frank Womack resigned. In spite of reaching a more respectable 6th place under his successor Billy Wooton in 1949, it wasn't until the appointment of <a href="George%20Hardwick">George Hardwick</a> as player-manager in November 1950 that the club found any real form.
Hardwick's appointment came at a cost, with a £15,000 transfer fee paid to <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>. This was a huge amount at the time, especially for a third division club, but it was to stir up the town and its fans, who now looked forward to seeing a man who had been captain of <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> only two years previously in charge of its club's fortunes. In Hardwick's first full season in charge they finished 4th after topping the table for a considerable time. Home gates stayed high, with an amazing 33,450 watching a 1–0 win over local rivals <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> in March 1952, after a January game in the snow had established a new club scoring record when <a href="Chester%20City%20F.C.">Chester</a> were beaten 11–2. Eric Gemmell scored seven of these to establish an individual club record for one game which still stands to date. The season after, Oldham Athletic proudly finished champions of the division and won promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. With an ageing squad and little money to recruit, however, the season that followed was a massive disappointment. Only eight games were won, Oldham finished in last place and quickly returned to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a>, where a first equally disappointing season saw them finish no higher than 10th.
Hardwick resigned in 1955 and between then and 1960, they continued to struggle, finishing below the top 20 on three occasions. With a 15th-place finish in 1958–59, Oldham became a founding member of a newly formed <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>. In the following season they finished in the 23rd position – their lowest position in the entire League, and had to apply for reelection, which they passed as the League chose to drop <a href="Gateshead%20F.C.">Gateshead</a>, who had finished above them, in favour of newcomers <a href="Peterborough%20United%20F.C.">Peterborough United</a>.
<a href="Ken%20Bates">Ken Bates</a> entered the picture at Oldham Athletic in the early 1960s (where he was chairman for 5 years), and along with the appointment of manager <a href="Jack%20Rowley">Jack Rowley</a>, the club's fortunes turned for the better. During the 1962–63 season, Oldham Athletic again gained promotion to the Third Division as Rowley left as manager. Over the next six seasons, Oldham struggled with consistency in the league and at the manager position, with <a href="Les%20McDowall">Les McDowall</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Hurst">Gordon Hurst</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20McIlroy">Jimmy McIlroy</a> all spending time at the managerial position.
In the 1968–69, <a href="Jack%20Rowley">Jack Rowley</a> once more returned as manager. With their inconsistency, Rowley and Bates could not save the club from a last-place finish and inevitable relegation. Midway through the 1969–70 season, Rowley and Bates both left the club as <a href="Jimmy%20Frizzell">Jimmy Frizzell</a> became Latics manager, a position he held for the next 13 seasons.
Frizzell and Royle eras.
In the 1970–71 season, Oldham saw their best result since 1962–63 as they finished in third place, earning promotion back to the Third Division. After a mid-table finish in their first season, Latics missed out on promotion, finishing in fourth place, seven points behind local rivals and league champions <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. In the 1973–74 season, Latics finished in 1st place and returned to the Second Division for the first time in 21 years. Oldham's trip back to the Second Division was far more successful than their previous visit. During Frizzell's remaining time at the club, Latics remained in the Second Division, but with little FA Cup and <a href="EFL%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> success.
In June 1982, the club appointed <a href="Joe%20Royle">Joe Royle</a> as their manager. Royle's side finished 7th in his first season in charge, but fell to 19th in his second. In the 1986–87 season, Oldham narrowly missed promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> finishing three points behind <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> and losing in the inaugural play-offs to <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>, when previous seasons would have seen them automatically promoted.
Royle's Latics reached <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in the <a href="1990%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1990 Football League Cup final</a> versus <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, where they lost 1–0. The next season, Oldham did not have the same cup success, but instead found success by winning the Second Division and returning to the First Division for the first time in 68 years. In their first season back in the top flight, the club finished 17th and became one of the founding members of the newly formed <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. After two further seasons at the top level, Oldham faced relegation yet again and during the following season, the Joe Royle era came to an end, as he left the club for <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>.
During this era, Oldham Athletic reached the FA Cup semi-finals twice, both times losing to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> after a replay. In 1994 they were less than a minute away from winning 1–0 in extra time when a <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a> equaliser for Manchester United saw the game at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> end in a 1–1 draw, and Oldham were beaten 4–1 in the replay at <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a>. Many fans of Oldham in the years since have described the last minute equaliser by Hughes the start of a decline from which Oldham have never recovered. Oldham failed to win any of their seven remaining league games following the semi-final and were relegated on the final day of the season after a 1–1 draw at <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>.
1994–2018: second and third tier struggles.
<a href="Graeme%20Sharp">Graeme Sharp</a> took over as Oldham's player-manager on the departure of Joe Royle in November 1994, but he was unable to mount a promotion challenge and the pressure continued to build up a year later when Oldham narrowly avoided relegation. Relegation to Division Two happened at the end of the 1996–97 season, just after Sharp had resigned to be succeeded by <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a>.
As one of the biggest clubs in Division Two for 1997–98, and being managed by Warnock who had achieved no less than five promotions with other clubs in the last 11 years, Oldham Athletic were tipped for an immediate return to Division One, but they finished a disappointing 13th in the league and Warnock resigned. Oldham would ultimately stay in the third tier for 21 years. Veteran striker <a href="Andy%20Ritchie%20%28English%20footballer%29">Andy Ritchie</a> took over as player-manager, but he too failed to mount a promotion challenge and was sacked in October 2001 to be succeeded by <a href="Mick%20Wadsworth">Mick Wadsworth</a>.
In 2001, <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>-based businessman Chris Moore purchased Oldham Athletic, vowing to take the club back to Premier League football within five years. Wadsworth quit as manager in the summer of 2002 to make way for <a href="Iain%20Dowie">Iain Dowie</a>, who transformed Oldham's fortunes on the pitch as they made their first serious challenge for promotion in Division Two. Oldham finished fifth and their promotion dreams were ended in the playoffs, and their fans were furious when Moore decided to end his interest with the club, leaving behind large debts and a weak squad, and after selling the better players at a fraction of their market value at the time. For a while, it looked as though the club would go out of business, but a takeover deal was soon completed.
In 2004–05, <a href="Simon%20Blitz">Simon Blitz</a> and two other partners, <a href="Simon%20Corney">Simon Corney</a> and <a href="Danny%20Gazal">Danny Gazal</a>, purchased Oldham Athletic, trying to rescue the club from possible <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a>. While trying to repay debts, Oldham struggled for several seasons, barely avoiding relegation once more in 2004–05. In 2006–07, Oldham's fortune turned for the better once more as the club narrowly missed out on promotion, losing to <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> 5–2 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final. After two years with the club, manager <a href="John%20Sheridan%20%28footballer%29">John Sheridan</a> was sacked on 15 March 2009, immediately being replaced by former manager Royle. After being offered the job on a permanent basis, Royle rejected the proposal and announced that he would be leaving the club after the final game of the season. <a href="Darlington%20F.C.">Darlington</a> boss <a href="Dave%20Penney">Dave Penney</a> was announced as Royle's successor on 30 April. Penney was dismissed as Oldham manager on 6 May 2010, with his assistant, <a href="Martin%20Gray%20%28footballer%29">Martin Gray</a>, taking over as caretaker manager for the final game of season 2009–10. During June 2010, <a href="Paul%20Dickov">Paul Dickov</a> was named as Oldham Athletic player-manager signing a one-year contract. On 3 February 2013, he left his role as manager despite having knocked <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> out of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> the previous week.
On 18 March 2013, the club hired <a href="Lee%20Johnson%20%28footballer%29">Lee Johnson</a> to become the next manager; at the time of his appointment, he was the youngest manager in the Football League at 31. The club narrowly avoided relegation for the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Football%20League%20One">2012–13 season</a>, finishing 19th and just three points above the drop zone. The club fared better in Johnson's second season, finishing mid-table at 15th.
In January 2015, it was reported that Oldham was attempting to sign <a href="Ched%20Evans">Ched Evans</a>, an accused rapist. The move faced a significant public backlash, including from politicians, while a petition against the signing gained 60,000 signatures and Verlin Rainwater Solutions withdrew club sponsorship. Oldham ultimately decided not to sign Evans due to "unbearable pressure" while condemning the "vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff".
In January 2018, Moroccan football agent <a href="Abdallah%20Lemsagam">Abdallah Lemsagam</a> agreed a deal with the club's majority shareholder Corney, ending his 14-year association with Oldham. Gazal and Blitz had left in 2010, with Corney staying as the majority shareholder. Lemsagam owned 97% of the club, while the Supporters' Trust maintained a 3% stake. The takeover did not include Boundary Park's North Stand, which the club did not own but could use on match days. In the two years prior to the Lemsagam deal, Oldham had faced a number of winding-up orders for non-payment of its tax bills, and saw its ground raided by <a href="HMRC">HMRC</a> in November 2017.
2018–present: decline and relegation from the Football League.
Oldham were relegated to <a href="League%20Two">League Two</a> on 5 May 2018. They had not been in the fourth tier since 1971. The club faced further HMRC winding-up petitions in late 2019 and early 2020. Former owner Blitz sought to put the club into <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> on 6 March 2020 because of debts owed to his company, Brass Bank, which owned Boundary Park, but the case was adjourned to 21 April after a "significant" proportion of the debt was paid, as was Oldham's tax debt to HMRC. One-time Watford owner <a href="Laurence%20Bassini">Laurence Bassini</a> was reported to be interested in buying the club, but this was labelled as "false" during the 6 March hearing.
Former Australia international <a href="Harry%20Kewell">Harry Kewell</a> took over as Oldham manager in August, at the start of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.%20season">2020–21</a> season and recorded 11 wins, six draws and 15 defeats before he was sacked by the club in March 2021. He left the club 10 points above the relegation places; some fans regarded the club's decision as premature given that Oldham had recently beaten promotion challengers <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a>, <a href="Forest%20Green%20Rovers%20F.C.">Forest Green Rovers</a> and <a href="Salford%20City%20F.C.">Salford City</a>. <a href="Keith%20Curle">Keith Curle</a> stepped in as temporary head coach, and made the move permanent in May 2021, but his efforts to build a stronger squad were hampered by an EFL <a href="Transfer%20%28association%20football%29%23Transfer%20bans">transfer embargo</a>, <a href="COVID-19">COVID-19</a> illness, and fans protests against the club's owner.
On 7 September, with the club in 23rd position in the fourth tier, Lemsagam insisted he did not wish to sell his stake. Curle left Oldham in November. In December 2021 Lemsagam announced he was willing to sell the club amid accusations of late payment of salaries, threats of player strikes, and concerns about <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>. Sheridan was re-appointed as manager in January 2022, but could not halt the slide towards the National League. With two games still to play, Oldham were relegated from the English Football League following a 2–1 home defeat by <a href="Salford%20City%20F.C.">Salford City</a> on 23 April, a match interrupted by an on-pitch protest by fans against the club's owner. The club became the first former Premier League team to drop into non-league since its creation in 1992.
Following the relegation, the club's supporters' trust started to campaign for a community takeover of the club. On 30 June 2022, after Lemsagam and the Boundary Park owner agreed to a sale, it was reported Oldham Athletic could be sold within the next month to an unnamed local business. On 28 July 2022, it was confirmed that the club had been sold to businessman Frank Rothwell, owner of Oldham-based Manchester Cabins, and that Oldham were at an advanced stage in negotiations to buy Boundary Park from former owner Simon Blitz - a deal agreed in late August 2022, and eventually completed in March 2023.
Oldham started their first <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">National League</a> campaign with just two wins from their first eight games. Sheridan stepped down as manager on 17 September 2022 following a 3–2 defeat of <a href="Eastleigh%20F.C.">Eastleigh</a> and was replaced by <a href="David%20Unsworth">David Unsworth</a>. The side finished the season in 12th place. Unsworth was sacked on 17 September 2023 after a seven-match winless run.
Kit and badge.
Latics originally started out playing in red and white hooped shirts with blue shorts, bearing strong similarities to the <a href="Oldham%20R.L.F.C.">Oldham Rugby League Club</a> colours. The red stripes were eventually replaced with blue, before this was in turn replaced by a white shirt with the blue stripe down the middle; this shirt was rumoured to have been influenced by the <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> shirt of the times. In the mid-1960s, under the ownership of <a href="Ken%20Bates">Ken Bates</a>, the strip was changed to tangerine shirts with blue shorts. In the mid-1970s the club adopted an all blue shirt, and these colours have been worn ever since, with the exception of the red and blue hooped shirt that was used the late 1990s. This shirt proved unpopular among supporters and caused kit clashing problems, resulting in opposition teams occasionally having to wear Oldham's away kit. The club brought back the colours from the 1960s as an away kit for the 2007–08 season and this proved to be popular amongst the supporters. Home and away shirts currently bear the slogan "keep the faith" as a result of the financial turmoil the club faced in 2004. On 27 April, it was announced on a new website set up by the club (wearelatics.co.uk) that there was to be a new crest for the club. This new badge was shown on the new away kit for the 2011–12 season, and was introduced to the home kit for the following season. The badge contains the traditional blue and white colours, however, there is no longer any red visible; there is still an image of an owl, yet it remains on top of a football.

Stadium.
After playing at what was originally called Athletic Ground, <a href="Boundary%20Park">Boundary Park</a> was opened for Oldham's first football club—Oldham County F.C. In 1899, after County had folded, Pine Villa moved into the ground and renamed the club and stadium. The stadium is located on the Oldham side of the conjunction of Oldham, <a href="Chadderton">Chadderton</a> and <a href="Royton">Royton</a>, and has a current capacity of 13,512. Before the demolition of the north stand in 2008, the stadium had a capacity of 13,624. The new north stand has recently opened with many new facilities available. This was done in a bid to gain extra revenue in a troubled cash stricken period for the club since Moore's departure.
The record attendance is 47,671 during an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> tie between Oldham and <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> in 1930 – the ground capacity at the time was nearly 50,000.
In February 2006, the club unveiled plans for the reconstruction of the stadium. After initially being rejected by Oldham Council, the decision was overturned with permission for the entire ground to be redeveloped. The ground was expected to seat at least 16,000 and cost approximately <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>80 million. On 5 September 2008, <a href="Simon%20Blitz">Simon Blitz</a> announced on <a href="World%20Soccer%20Daily">World Soccer Daily</a> podcast that due to the economic problems in England, the development of the stadium was placed on hold temporarily.
On 22 July 2009, the club and Oldham Council unveiled plans for an entirely new, £20 million stadium to be located in <a href="Failsworth">Failsworth</a>. The club made an agreement with <a href="BAE%20Systems">BAE Systems</a> to purchase a piece of land, on which the club plans to build an initial 12,000-capacity arena along with other leisure and corporate facilities. Oldham Council initially backed the plans for the new stadium after council chiefs voted in favour of pushing forward with a land deal, but later offered the club £5.7 million to help with the redevelopment of Boundary Park, which would involve building a new North Stand on the site of the former Broadway Stand.
Initial preparatory work began on the site for the new North Stand at Boundary Park in mid-May 2013. The stand has a capacity of 2,671 for spectators and contains various other non-matchday facilities such as a health and fitness suite and supporters bar. The new North Stand partially opened against Sheffield United on 17 October 2015, with maximum capacity operation and corporate facilities in use on 26 December 2015 vs. <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers">Doncaster Rovers</a>.

Rivalries.
Boundary Park is less than from the nearby Football League stadiums of <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a>, <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, <a href="Salford%20City%20F.C.">Salford City</a> and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, with the stadiums of <a href="Stockport%20County">Stockport County</a>, <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>, <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>, <a href="Accrington%20Stanley%20F.C.">Accrington Stanley</a> and <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> all within a 20-mile (32 km) radius.
Traditional local rivals over the years include <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>, <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>, <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a> and <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a>, although many of these clubs are no longer a regular opponent.
Dislike for <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> is also common and often eclipses more traditional rivalries amongst Oldham supporters. This is largely fuelled by Oldham's proximity to Manchester, with a sizeable number of people in the borough choosing to support one of the Manchester clubs rather than their local club. The dislike for <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> is also partly fuelled by the FA Cup semi-final meetings in 1990 and 1994, both of which Oldham lost after replays.
A survey conducted in August 2019 by GiveMeSport.com revealed that Latics fans consider <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a> to be the club's main rival with 82% of votes, followed by <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> (74%), <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> (67%), <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> (58%) and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> (52%).

Club management.
As of 17 December 2023
Managerial history.
In the history of the club, only three managers have won a league title: <a href="George%20Hardwick">George Hardwick</a> (Division Three North, 1953), <a href="Jimmy%20Frizzell">Jimmy Frizzell</a> (Division Three, 1974) and <a href="Joe%20Royle">Joe Royle</a> (Division Two, 1991). Frizzell also won promotion from Division Four in 1971 (3rd place), as did <a href="Jack%20Rowley">Jack Rowley</a> from the runners-up spot in 1963.
However, arguably the most successful manager in the club's history is David Ashworth. Appointed in 1906, he guided them to the Lancashire Combination Championship and promotion to the Football League in his first season. In 1910, after just three seasons in Division 2, they finished in second place and won promotion to the top flight of English football. For the next four years Ashworth maintained the club's smooth progress. They finished season 1913–14 in fourth place, only for Ashworth to move to Stockport County, leaving his successor Herbert Bamlett to take the team to its best-ever league placing the season after, when they finished runners-up to Everton, missing out on the League Championship by just one point.
Meanwhile, at the end of World War 1, Ashworth emerged as manager of Liverpool, guiding them to the League Championship in 1921–22, after they had finished fourth in his previous two seasons. Although he then took what seemed to many to be a strange decision, moving back to Oldham in a brave but failed attempt to save them from relegation in 1923, he remains the only Oldham Athletic manager ever to have won the Football League Championship with any club.

Swansea City A.F.C.

Swansea City Association Football Club (; ) is a Welsh professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a>, Wales. It competes in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a>, the second tier of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a>. Swansea have played their home matches at the <a href="Swansea.com%20Stadium">Swansea.com Stadium</a> (formerly known as the Liberty Stadium) since 2005, having previously played at the <a href="Vetch%20Field">Vetch Field</a> since the club was founded.
The club was founded in 1912 as Swansea Town and entered into the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>, winning the <a href="Welsh%20Cup">Welsh Cup</a> in their debut season. They were admitted into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1920 and won the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> title in 1924–25. They again won the Third Division South title in 1948–49, having been relegated two years previously. They fell into the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> after relegations in 1965 and 1967. The club changed their name to Swansea City in 1969 to reflect Swansea's new status as a <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city</a>. They were promoted at the end of the 1969–70 season.
Swansea won three promotions in four seasons to reach the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1981. They finished sixth the following season, a club record. The club suffered a relegation the season after, returning to the Fourth Division by 1986 and then narrowly avoiding relegation to the <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">Conference</a> in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2003</a>. In 2011, they were promoted to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> and won the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> two years later, beating <a href="Bradford%20City">Bradford City</a> <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">5–0</a> in the final. It was the competition's highest ever winning margin for the final, with Swansea winning the first major trophy in the club's history and qualifying for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2013–14 UEFA Europa League</a>. The club was relegated from the Premier League at the end of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a>.
The club's climb from the fourth division of English football to the top division is chronicled in the 2014 film, "<a href="Jack%20to%20a%20King%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Swansea%20Story">Jack to a King – The Swansea Story</a>". The Swansea City Supporters Trust continues to own shares in the club; their involvement was hailed by <a href="Supporters%20Direct">Supporters Direct</a> in 2012 as "the most high profile example of the involvement of a supporters' trust in the direct running of a club". Though based in Wales, they play in the English football league system.

History.
Early years (1912–1945).
The area around Swansea traditionally had been a <a href="Rugby%20union%20in%20Wales">rugby</a> area, and despite previous attempts by a football club named Swansea Villa, there were no notable football clubs until the establishment of 'Swansea Town AFC' in the summer of 1912. Following the lead of many other <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a> sides, the club joined the Second Division of the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> for the following season. J. W. Thorpe was the club's first chairman. A site owned by Swansea Gaslight Co., called <a href="Vetch%20Field">Vetch Field</a> due to the vegetables that grew there, was rented to be the club's ground.
The club's first professional match was a 1–1 draw at the Vetch Field against <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> on 7 September 1912. During that first season the <a href="Welsh%20Cup">Welsh Cup</a> was won for the first time. The Swans beat reigning English champions <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> 1–0 in the first round of the 1914–15 <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, Swansea's goal coming from <a href="Ben%20Beynon">Ben Beynon</a>.
Following the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> the Southern League dropped its Second Division, and with many clubs dropping out due to financial difficulties, the Swans were placed in the First Division. After four seasons in the Southern League, Swansea Town became founder members of the new <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> of <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> in 1920 and then <a href="Division%20Three%20%28South%29">Division Three (South)</a> the following season.
After five seasons in Division Three (South) and a few failed bids for promotion, the Swans reached the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> for the first time in 1925, beating <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> 2–1 at home on the final day of the season to win the division. The side had remained unbeaten at home in the league all season – something the next promotion team would emulate over twenty years later. The following season the Swans reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time, beating Exeter City, <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>, <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a>, Stoke City, <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> and <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, before losing 3–0 to eventual cup winners <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> at <a href="White%20Hart%20Lane">White Hart Lane</a>. Swans record their highest average attendance during the season of 16,118 for pre-war league games. During the 1926–27 season they beat <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> 3–0 on tour. During the 1931–32 season they finished 1st in the league and won the Welsh Cup after beating <a href="Wrexham%20F.C.">Wrexham</a> 2–0 away after a replay.
Post-war (1945–1965).
After just one season back from wartime football, the Swans finished 21st in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, and thus returned to <a href="Division%20Three%20%28South%29">Division Three (South)</a> for the first time since 1925. The following season was one of consolidation, however in 1948–1949 the Swans stormed their way to winning the division for the second time. Only one point was dropped at home all season as the feat of the 1925 promotion side was emulated, with the side finishing a whole seven points ahead of second placed <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>. <a href="Billy%20McCandless">Billy McCandless</a> was the manager who led the side to promotion, and in doing so he completed a rare <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> of winning the Third Division (South) title with all three <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a> clubs – and without losing a home game with Swansea or Cardiff.
Following promotion, the Swans had another 15 years of Second Division football to look forward to, however despite what successive managers and chairmen were to say, Swansea Town only once during that time looked like they could genuinely challenge for promotion. That came in the 1955–56 season, when a side containing the likes of <a href="Ivor%20Allchurch">Ivor Allchurch</a>, <a href="Terry%20Medwin">Terry Medwin</a>, <a href="Harry%20Griffiths%20%28footballer%20born%201931%29">Harry Griffiths</a> and Tom Kiley led the table early in the season, before an injury to Kiley, referred to as the <a href="linchpin">linchpin</a> of the side, in mid-November led to a decline in form. He was never adequately replaced, but despite this and the sale of some of the club's best players, the side remained in contention for promotion until the beginning of April. Following a 6–1 win over second placed <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> at the Vetch Field at the end of March the side was just two points behind second placed <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> with a game in hand – however subsequent results were not as encouraging, and they eventually slipped away to finish tenth.
In 1964, the Swans reached a second <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-final, beating <a href="Barrow%20A.F.C.">Barrow</a>, <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> en route to a famous sixth round victory at Anfield. Few gave the Swans, struggling for their lives at the bottom of Division Two, any chance of causing an upset against the league leaders. But the Swans were 0–2 up at half-time thanks to <a href="Jim%20McLaughlin%20%28footballer%29">Jimmy McLaughlin</a> and Eddie Thomas. Liverpool turned up the pressure in the second half, pulling a goal back before being awarded a penalty nine minutes from time. <a href="Ronnie%20Moran">Ronnie Moran</a> had established an excellent record as a <a href="Penalty%20%28rugby%29">penalty</a> taker, but he failed to beat the excellent <a href="Noel%20Dwyer">Noel Dwyer</a> on this occasion. Fellow second division side <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> awaited in the semi-final at <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a>, but despite taking the lead through McLaughlin again, the Swans were to be denied by a second half penalty and a wonder goal from nearly 40 yards.
After flirting with relegation on a few occasions during the previous seasons, the Swans' luck finally ran out a season later in 1965, and they were back in the Third Division.
A downward spiral (1965–1977).
Following relegation, <a href="Trevor%20Morris%20%28footballer%29">Trevor Morris</a>, who had been manager since 1958, was sacked and <a href="Glyn%20Davies%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201932%29">Glyn Davies</a>, a former Swansea player, was appointed in his place. Davies re-signed the 36-year-old <a href="Ivor%20Allchurch">Ivor Allchurch</a> from <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a>, but despite winning the <a href="Welsh%20Cup">Welsh Cup</a>, the season saw some of the club's heaviest defeats, and the manager only lasted the season. Relegation to Division Four followed in 1967 and <a href="Ivor%20Allchurch">Ivor Allchurch</a> retired. The 1967–68 season saw the record attendance of 32,796 at the <a href="Vetch%20Field">Vetch Field</a> for an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> Fourth Round match against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>.
A tragedy struck the club on 20 January 1969 when players Roy Evans and Brian Purcell were killed in a car crash on the way to a game.
In 1969, the club name was changed to Swansea City, and <a href="Roy%20Bentley">Roy Bentley</a>'s side celebrated by securing promotion back to the Third Division. A record run of 19 matches unbeaten provided the foundations for a promotion challenge in 1971–72, but an awful run towards the end of the season resulted in a mid-table finish. A poor start the following season, combined with falling attendances, saw Bentley resign, and he was replaced by <a href="Harry%20Gregg">Harry Gregg</a>. Gregg failed to stop the rot and the club was back in the Fourth Division for 1973–74 season.
A record low crowd of just 1,358 watched the Swans against <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a>, and the following season the Swans were forced to apply for re-election to the Football League after a last day defeat at <a href="Rochdale%20F.C.">Rochdale</a> condemned them to a 21st-place finish. The application was a success, although by now former player Harry Griffiths had replaced Gregg as manager. Malcolm Struel also took over as chairman, having previously been on the board, and promised a return to former glories, stating that he would not sell the club's best young talent as previous boards had done.
Meteoric rise and equally rapid fall (1977–1986).
Despite promising performances during the first half of the 1977–78 season, Harry Griffiths resigned as Swansea City's manager in February 1978, doubting his own ability to take the club any further. The new manager was former <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> and <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a> striker <a href="John%20Toshack">John Toshack</a>. On 1 March 1978, at 28 years old, Toshack became the youngest manager in the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a>, with Griffiths as his assistant. Thus began a remarkable climb from the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> to the top of the entire league. Despite relinquishing his role as manager before the end of the season, this was Griffiths' team, and the promotion from the Fourth Division was largely his doing. During this season, the Swans' record league win was achieved (8–0 against <a href="Hartlepool%20United%20F.C.">Hartlepool United</a>). Before promotion was secured, however, Harry Griffiths died of a heart attack on 25 April 1978 before the home game against <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a>.
A further promotion was achieved next season and the club returned to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> after an absence of 14 years, with Toshack himself coming off the bench to score the winning goal against <a href="Chesterfield%20F.C.">Chesterfield</a> and thus secure promotion.
After a season of consolidation, Swansea City again challenged for promotion and travelled to <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> on 2 May 1981 in the knowledge that victory would assure them a place in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> for the first time in the club's history. A 3–1 win guaranteed a third promotion in four seasons and Swansea City joined the footballing elite. The goalscorers on that day at <a href="Deepdale">Deepdale</a> were <a href="Tommy%20Craig">Tommy Craig</a>, <a href="Leighton%20James">Leighton James</a> and <a href="Jeremy%20Charles">Jeremy Charles</a>. The four-year rise from basement to top division is a record in English football, held jointly with <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon F.C.</a> Swansea also won the Welsh Cup that season, qualifying for Europe for the first time since the 1965–66 season.
The 1981–82 season began with the fixture computer handing Swansea a first-day home game against <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>, which the club promptly won 5–1 with a hat-trick by debutant <a href="Bob%20Latchford">Bob Latchford</a>. Swansea had swept from the basement division to the top of the entire Football League in three years. Victories over <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> and <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> followed as the club topped the league on several further occasions. However, injuries to key players took their toll, and the lack of depth in the squad meant that the season ended in sixth-place finish.
Two consecutive relegations followed, and Toshack was sacked. By 1985, the club was battling for its very survival on two fronts. Whilst its creditors lined up a <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> hearing with the aim of liquidating the club, Swansea City had come to rely on a combination of old players and young professionals.
Wound up by court order in December 1985, Swansea City was saved by local businessman Doug Sharpe who took over the running of the club, although the change of ownership was not enough to prevent relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> in 1986. Eight years on from the first promotion under Toshack, the club was back where it had started.
In place of strife (1986–1995).
Swansea won promotion from the Fourth Division in 1988 – beating <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a> and <a href="Torquay%20United%20F.C.">Torquay United</a> over two legs in the inaugural playoffs. They remained in the league's third tier for the next eight seasons – the longest period of stability the club had seen since the 1940s. Under <a href="Terry%20Yorath">Terry Yorath</a> and then <a href="Frank%20Burrows">Frank Burrows</a>, the club managed to stay in the Second Division, reach the playoff semi-finals in 1993 and make their first <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> appearance a year later.
Burrows guided the Swans to within 180 minutes of Wembley in 1993 – a run of five wins in the last six league matches (all at home) secured a playoff place, and with five minutes remaining of the first leg of the semi-final against <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>, the Swans were 2–0 up. Andy McFarlane scored an <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> when the ball rebounded off the crossbar then into the net off his knee, and two early goals in the second leg gave the Baggies the advantage, until midfielder <a href="Micky%20Mellon">Micky Mellon</a> was sent off. Burrows brought on <a href="Colin%20West">Colin West</a>, but he was sent off minutes later, ending any hopes of a Wembley final.
Although the league campaign the following season did not live up the previous one, mainly due to the sale of key players, Burrows guided the Swans to Wembley for the first time in their history for the final of the Autoglass Trophy. Wins over <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a> & <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> in the group stage followed by triumphs over Exeter again, <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a>, <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a> and <a href="Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wycombe Wanderers</a> over two legs saw the Swans play <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> in a final that finished 1–1. The Swans went on to win 3–1 on penalties.
In the following season, the club again reached the semi-finals of the Auto Windscreens Shield, eventually going out to <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>, and an eventful FA Cup run saw them win at <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> in a third round replay, before going out to Newcastle United at <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a>.
The 1995–96 season ended with relegation back to the third division after eight years. The Swans were doing fine around Christmas time, but a complete collapse in the second half of the season, including a 7–0 FA Cup defeat at third division <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, 4–0 and 5–1 defeats at Blackpool and <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a> respectively, led to relegation, despite the arrival of <a href="Jan%20M%C3%B8lby">Jan Mølby</a>.
The difficult years return (1995–2001).
Relegation in 1996 was accompanied by a club record of being managed by four men in the same season. <a href="Kevin%20Cullis">Kevin Cullis</a> was appointed as manager by a <a href="consortium">consortium</a> wishing to buy the club. Cullis, whose previous experience was with <a href="non-league">non-league</a> club <a href="Cradley%20Town%20F.C.">Cradley Town</a> youth team. Alarmed at developments at the club, Sharpe invoked a contractual clause to cancel the deal and resumed control himself: Cullis was promptly sacked after just six days.
Cullis's successor was the Dane, <a href="Jan%20M%C3%B8lby">Jan Mølby</a>, a former <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> player taking his first steps in management. His appointment inevitably prompted comparison with the Toshack era which began nearly 20 years earlier. Despite relegation in 1996, the club reached the final of the 1997 <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> promotion play-offs but lost to <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a>, whose goal came from a re-taken free kick by <a href="John%20Frain">John Frain</a> in the final minute. Mølby was sacked just weeks into the following season, with Swansea struggling near the foot of the league. After the initial optimism, the Liverpool connection had not caused history to repeat itself.
<a href="Alan%20Cork">Alan Cork</a> was appointed as manager, but was dismissed after leading the club to its lowest league finish for 23 years. <a href="John%20Hollins">John Hollins</a> was appointed, and things soon started to improve. In 1999, the club reached the promotion <a href="play-offs">playoffs</a>, only to lose in extra time at <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a>. The season included a third round <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> victory over <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">Premiership</a> opponents <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>, whose team included <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard</a>, <a href="Joe%20Cole">Joe Cole</a>, <a href="Rio%20Ferdinand">Rio Ferdinand</a> and <a href="John%20Hartson">John Hartson</a>. Swansea thus became the first <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">bottom division</a> team to defeat a <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">Premiership</a> club in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> since the re-organisation of the league structure in 1992.
The club was promoted in 2000 as <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three</a> champions, following a championship decider on the final day of the season against second-placed <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a>. The side conceded just 32 goals during the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, largely due to the form of excellent centre-back pairing Jason Smith and <a href="Matthew%20Bound">Matthew Bound</a>, as well as <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">keeper</a> <a href="Roger%20Freestone">Roger Freestone</a>. During the season the side set a record of nine consecutive league victories, and, during the same period, seven consecutive clean sheets. Striker <a href="Walter%20Boyd%20%28footballer%29">Walter Boyd</a> also set an unwanted record of being the fastest substitute ever sent off, when he was red-carded for striking a <a href="Darlington%20F.C.">Darlington</a> player seconds after being brought on and before play had resumed, therefore being officially recorded as zero seconds.
Promotion was secured courtesy of a 3–0 win over <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> at a packed <a href="Vetch%20Field">Vetch Field</a>. However, the following week's 1–1 draw at <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a>, which confirmed Swansea as Division Three Champions, was overshadowed by the death of supporter Terry Coles, who was trampled to death by a <a href="police%20horse">police horse</a> in narrow Millmoor Lane before the game.
The team were relegated in May 2001, just 12 months after promotion. Hollins had failed to strengthen the side at all during the summer, and despite a decent start, a 5–1 defeat at big-spending <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> in September led to a slide down the table, and the side won just eight games all season, and only <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a> finished below them. Relegation seemed certain following a 5–3 defeat at fellow strugglers <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>, where <a href="Giovanni%20Savarese">Giovanni Savarese</a> scored a hat-trick, however Hollins maintained that the side could stay up, even when 18 points were needed from the final six matches, and for two other teams to pick up no more points.
Last years at Vetch Field and return to League One (2001–2005).
In July 2001, following relegation back to <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>, the club was sold to managing director Mike Lewis for £1. Lewis subsequently sold on his stake to a consortium of Australian businessmen behind the <a href="Brisbane%20Lions">Brisbane Lions</a> (An Australian Rules Football team that is based in Brisbane) football team, fronted by Tony Petty. Seven players were sacked and eight others saw their contracts terminated. During this period Hollins was sacked after a poor start to the season, and <a href="Colin%20Addison">Colin Addison</a> took over as manager. The turmoil led to the creation of the Swansea City <a href="supporters%27%20trust">supporters' trust</a>, which sought to save the club and ultimately guarantee supporter representation on the club's board.
The Petty group sold its stake in January 2002 after a bitter stand-off with the Mel Nurse consortium, which was supported by the majority of the club's fans. Jim Moore and Mel Griffin, previously rescuers of Hull City, stepped into the breach and persuaded Petty to sell to them (as he had promised to bankrupt the club & make it extinct rather than sell to Nurse). From there Moore became chairman for three weeks giving the "Mel Nurse Consortium" time to organize its finances. Having successfully reorganized the finances of Hull City, both Moore and Griffin were believers in clubs belonging in the hands of local people, and so believing Nurse's group were best for The Swans, subsequently passed the club onto Nurses consortium for the fee of £1. Despite problems off the pitch, Addison's side had managed a mid-table position, but he was dismissed in early March, and under <a href="Nick%20Cusack">Nick Cusack</a> the club slumped to a 20th placed-finish. Cusack lasted just eight games into the following season, and was sacked after a 1–0 defeat at league debutants <a href="Boston%20United%20F.C.">Boston United</a> had put the Swans on the bottom of the Football League for the first time in their 91-year history. He was replaced by <a href="Brian%20Flynn%20%28footballer%29">Brian Flynn</a>. Swansea City avoided relegation to the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a> on the last day of the season, at the expense of <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a>, a club then vice-chaired by Mike Lewis.
Brian Flynn's side finished 2003–04 10th and reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in 24 years, eventually losing 2–1 at <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere Rovers</a>. Flynn was dismissed and replaced by <a href="Kenny%20Jackett">Kenny Jackett</a>. Jackett lost his first six matches in charge, ending any hope of a play-off place. The following season Jackett recruited a number of new defensive players and set a record of seven consecutive home clean sheets, all victories. The Swans' last season at the Vetch Field saw the club win promotion on the last day of the season, clinching a 3rd-placed finish with a 1–0 win away to <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>. Their last league game at their old ground was a 1–0 win over <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.">Shrewsbury Town</a>, with the last game of any sort being a 2–1 win against <a href="Wrexham%20A.F.C.">Wrexham</a> in the final of the 2005 <a href="FAW%20Premier%20Cup">FAW Premier Cup</a>.
Move to Liberty Stadium and return to top flight (2005–2011).
The club moved to the new <a href="Liberty%20Stadium">Liberty Stadium</a> during the summer of 2005. The first competitive game was a 1–0 victory against <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere Rovers</a> in August 2005. In their first season back in League One, Swansea, after beating <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> in the semi-finals, lost on <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a> to <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> in the final at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in Cardiff. That same season, Swansea won the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> for the first time since 1994, and the <a href="FAW%20Premier%20Cup">FAW Premier Cup</a> for a second successive year.
In the following season Jackett resigned as manager in mid-season to be replaced by <a href="Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Roberto Martínez</a>. Martínez's arrival saw an improvement in form, but Swansea missed out on the play-offs again. The following season, an 18-game unbeaten run helped them to the League One title. The club amassed a total of 92 points over the course of the season, the highest ever by a Welsh club in the Football League. Five Swansea players were in the PFA Team of the Year, including the division's 29-goal top scorer <a href="Jason%20Scotland">Jason Scotland</a>. That same season Swansea lost on penalties to <a href="Milton%20Keynes%20Dons">Milton Keynes Dons</a> in the area final of the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a>.
Upon returning to the second tier of English football after 24 years Swansea City finished the 2008–09 season in eighth place, and missed out on the play-offs the following season by a single point. After 63 wins in 126 games for Swansea City, Martínez left for <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> on 15 June 2009 with his tenure returning just 26 losses in that time. He was replaced by Portuguese <a href="Paulo%20Sousa">Paulo Sousa</a>. Sousa subsequently left Swansea to take charge at <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> on 5 July 2010, lasting just one year and 13 days in South Wales. However, just before the departure of Sousa, on 15 May 2010, Swansea player <a href="Besian%20Idrizaj">Besian Idrizaj</a> suffered a heart attack in his native Austria while on international duty. The club retired the number 40 shirt in his memory, and the players wore shirts dedicated to Idrizaj after their victory in the play-off final.
Northern Irishman <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> took charge for the 2010–11 season. He guided the club to a third-placed finish and qualification for the Championship play-offs. After beating <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> 3–1 on aggregate in the semi-final they defeated <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> 4–2 in <a href="2011%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">the final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, with <a href="Scott%20Sinclair">Scott Sinclair</a> scoring a hat-trick.
Premier League and Europe (2011–2018).
By being promoted to the Premier League for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Premier%20League">2011–12</a> season, Swansea became the first Welsh team to play in the division since its formation in 1992. Swansea signed <a href="Danny%20Graham%20%28footballer%29">Danny Graham</a> from <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a> for a then-record fee of £3.5 million. They defeated <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, the eventual champions, at home during the season. Swansea finished their debut Premier League season in 11th, but at the end of the season <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> left to manage Liverpool. He was replaced by <a href="Michael%20Laudrup">Michael Laudrup</a> for the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Premier%20League">2012–13 Premier League season</a>, which was the club's centenary season. Laudrup's first league game ended in a 0–5 victory over <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> away at <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a>. Swansea then beat <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> 3–0 at the <a href="Liberty%20Stadium">Liberty Stadium</a>, with <a href="Michu">Michu</a> scoring his third goal in two games. This saw Swansea top of the Premier League; it was the first time since October 1981 the team had been at the summit of the top tier.
On 15 October 2012, the club announced a profit of £14.2 million after their first season in the Premier League. On 1 December, Swansea picked up a 0–2 away win against Arsenal, with Michu scoring twice during the last minutes of the game, in Swansea's first win at Arsenal in three decades. Michu ended the season as the club's top scorer in all competitions, with 22 goals.
On 24 February 2013, Swansea beat <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C">Bradford City</a> 0–5 in the <a href="2013%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a> en route to the biggest win in the final of the competition. This triumph, in a record victory, was Swansea's first major piece of silverware and qualified them for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2013–14 UEFA Europa League</a>. Swansea finished the season in ninth place in the Premier League, improving upon the league standing achieved in the previous season. On 11 July, Swansea paid a club record transfer fee of £12 million to secure the signing of striker <a href="Wilfried%20Bony">Wilfried Bony</a> from <a href="Vitesse%20Arnhem">Vitesse Arnhem</a>; Bony was the leading goalscorer in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Eredivisie">2012–13 Eredivisie</a> with 31 goals and was named Dutch Player of the Year.
Swansea enjoyed initial success in Europe, beating Spanish side <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> 3–0 at the <a href="Mestalla%20Stadium">Mestalla Stadium</a> in September 2013. On 3 November 2013, Swansea lost the first Welsh derby in the Premier League to Cardiff City following a 1–0 defeat. In February 2014, Laudrup was dismissed from the club, initially thought because of a poor run of form; however later investigation revealed financial impropriety involving Laudrup's agent Bayram Tutumlu. Defender <a href="Garry%20Monk">Garry Monk</a>, a Swansea player since 2004, was named as his replacement. In Monk's first game in charge, Swansea beat Cardiff 3–0 at the Liberty Stadium on 8 February 2014. Despite holding <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a>'s <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a> to a 0–0 draw in the first leg of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20knockout%20phase">Europa League Round of 32</a>, Swansea exited the competition after losing 3–1 in the second leg at the <a href="Stadio%20San%20Paolo">Stadio San Paolo</a> on 27 February 2014.
In January 2015, Wilfried Bony was sold to Manchester City for a record sale of £25 million, with add-ons reportedly leading to £28 million. This deal eclipsed the record fee received from Liverpool for <a href="Joe%20Allen">Joe Allen</a> at £15 million. At the time of the sale, Bony was the club's top scorer with 34 goals in all competitions, and the Premier League's top scorer for the 2014 calendar year, with 20 goals. Swansea City finished eighth in the Premier League at the end of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a> with 56 points, their highest position and points haul for a Premier League season, and second highest finish in the top flight of all time. During the season, they produced league doubles over Arsenal and <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a>, becoming only the third team in Premier League history to achieve that feat.
On 9 December 2015, manager Garry Monk was sacked after one win in eleven matches. The club, after a period with <a href="Alan%20Curtis%20%28footballer%29">Alan Curtis</a> as caretaker manager for the third time, chose the Italian former <a href="Udinese%20Calcio">Udinese Calcio</a> coach <a href="Francesco%20Guidolin">Francesco Guidolin</a>. During the 2016–17 preseason, Swansea City came under new ownership by an American consortium led by <a href="Jason%20Levien">Jason Levien</a> and <a href="Steven%20Kaplan%20%28investor%29">Steven Kaplan</a>, who bought a controlling interest in the club in July 2016. Chairman <a href="Huw%20Jenkins%20%28Welsh%20businessman%29">Huw Jenkins</a> remained at the club. On 3 October 2016, Guidolin was sacked and replaced by American coach <a href="Bob%20Bradley">Bob Bradley</a>. The selection of Bradley marked the first time a Premier League club had ever hired an American manager. Bradley himself was sacked after just 85 days in charge; he won only two of his 11 games, conceded 29 goals, and left with a win percentage of just 18.1%.
On 3 January 2017, <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> assistant manager <a href="Paul%20Clement%20%28football%20manager%29">Paul Clement</a> agreed to take charge of the team, replacing Bradley. Following Clement's arrival, <a href="Nigel%20Gibbs">Nigel Gibbs</a> and <a href="Claude%20Mak%C3%A9l%C3%A9l%C3%A9">Claude Makélélé</a> were appointed his assistant coaches and Karl Halabi was appointed Head of Physical Performance. During the remainder of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2016–17 season</a>, Clement led Swansea to win 26 points from 18 games, securing their survival on 14 May. Only three prior teams had climbed from bottom of the table at Christmas to escape relegation, and only one prior team was able to escape relegation while having three managers during a season.
On 6 November 2017, assistant coach Claude Makélélé left the club to join Belgian side <a href="K.A.S.%20Eupen">Eupen</a>. He was replaced by long-term Swansea player <a href="Leon%20Britton">Leon Britton</a>. A poor first half of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a> saw Swansea sitting bottom of the table after 18 league games, which led to Clement being sacked on 20 December 2017, leaving the club four points adrift of safety. Towards the end of his tenure, Clement was criticised by a section of Swansea supporters for playing "boring" and "negative" football, questioning his tactical decisions with the Swans being the lowest scorers in the Premier League at the time of his sacking. He was replaced by Portuguese manager <a href="Carlos%20Carvalhal">Carlos Carvalhal</a>. Despite consecutive league home wins against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> (1–0), <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> (3–1), <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> (1–0), and <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham</a> (4–1), Swansea were winless in their last nine league games (losing five) under Carvalhal, leaving them in 18th place on the final day of the season.
During the season, chairman Huw Jenkins and the club's American owners were criticised by Swansea fans and pundits for poor <a href="transfer%20window">transfer window</a>s and the firing of managers; <a href="Alan%20Shearer">Alan Shearer</a> blamed the Swansea board for moving away from the style of play found under previous managers <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> and <a href="Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Roberto Martínez</a>.
Return to the Championship (2018–present).
Swansea City were relegated on 13 May 2018, following a 2–1 defeat to already-relegated <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a>. On 11 June 2018, <a href="Graham%20Potter">Graham Potter</a> was announced as the club's new manager, replacing Carvalhal. On 2 February 2019, Huw Jenkins resigned as chairman amid increasing criticism over the club's sale to the American consortium in 2016 and the club's subsequent relegation from the Premier League. He was replaced with <a href="Trevor%20Birch">Trevor Birch</a>. The first season back in the Championship produced a 10th-place finish, including a quarter-final appearance in the FA Cup. However, Potter left at the end of the season to manage Premier League club <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton</a>. He was succeeded by former <a href="England%20national%20under-17%20football%20team">England U17</a> manager <a href="Steve%20Cooper%20%28football%20manager%29">Steve Cooper</a>, with <a href="Mike%20Marsh%20%28footballer%29">Mike Marsh</a> joining him as his assistant. In September 2019, Cooper was named <a href="EFL%20Championship%20Manager%20of%20the%20Month">EFL Championship Manager of The Month</a>, with Swansea City sitting top of the table after an unbeaten first month; this was Swansea's best start to a season in 41 years. On the final day of the season, Swansea beat <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> 4–1 to finish sixth, moving into the play-offs ahead of <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>, but were later defeated by <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> in the semi-final second leg.
At the end of the 2020–21 season, Swansea finished 4th in the league and secured a play-off place for a second consecutive season. Swansea progressed to the <a href="2021%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2021 EFL Championship play-off final</a> after defeating <a href="Barnsley%20FC">Barnsley</a> 2–1 on aggregate, but lost to Brentford at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>. For the 2021–22 season, the club unveiled a modernised version of the original crest to mark the 40th anniversary of the Swans' first promotion to the top flight in 1981. After Steve Cooper left the club, <a href="Russell%20Martin%20%28footballer%29">Russell Martin</a> became head coach. Martin spoke with former Swansea boss Graham Potter before accepting the job. He said, "I know the fanbase and what they expect in terms of the modern Swansea Way, that started under <a href="Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Roberto Martínez</a> and continued under <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> and <a href="Michael%20Laudrup">Michael Laudrup</a>. We, as a coaching team, are very much aligned with that. It excites me."
Stadium.
Before Swansea Town was established, children would play football on waste ground in which a plant, called "<a href="vetch">vetch</a>" (a type of legume) was grown. The site was owned by Swansea Gaslight Company in 1912, but was deemed surplus to requirements at the Gas Company. So Swansea Town moved in when they were established in 1912. The ground originally held 12,000, but hit its peak attendance of 32,786 in a <a href="FA%20Cup%201967-68">1967 FA cup</a> Fifth Round against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. The last league goal ever scored at the Vetch was scored by <a href="Adrian%20Forbes">Adrian Forbes</a>, on 30 April 2005, as Swansea beat <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.">Shrewsbury Town</a> 1–0.
With a rapidly deteriorating Vetch Field, Swansea looked to relocate. As Swansea and the <a href="Ospreys%20%28rugby%20union%29">Ospreys</a> did not have the capital to invest in a new stadium, the <a href="City%20and%20County%20of%20Swansea%20council">Swansea City Council</a> and a developer-led consortia submitted a proposal for a sustainable "bowl" venue for 20,520 seats on a site to the west of the river on the site of the <a href="Morfa%20Stadium">Morfa Stadium</a>, which the Council owned. It was funded by a 355,000 ft retail park on land to the east of the river. The final value of the development being in excess of £50 million. On 23 July 2005, The <a href="Liberty%20Stadium">Liberty Stadium</a> was officially opened as Swansea faced <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in a <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly game</a>.
The Liberty Stadium capacity was 20,532 though has been increased to 21,088. The highest attendance recorded at the stadium came against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> on 31 October 2015 with 20,937 spectators, beating the previous record of 20,845. The stadium has also hosted three <a href="Welsh%20national%20football%20team">Welsh international football</a> matches; the first being a 0–0 draw with <a href="Bulgaria%20national%20football%20team">Bulgaria</a> in 2006, the second a 2–1 defeat to <a href="Georgia%20national%20football%20team">Georgia</a> in 2008 and a 2–0 win over <a href="Switzerland%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a> on 7 October 2011. The first international goal to be scored at the Liberty Stadium was a 25-yard effort from Welsh international <a href="Jason%20Koumas">Jason Koumas</a>.
On 1 July 2012, it was widely reported in national media that Swansea City were beginning the planning phase for expanding the Liberty Stadium by approximately 12,000 seats. This plan would be conditional on a successful second season in the Premier League and could cost up to £15 million; the increase would result in a capacity of approximately 32,000 seats. Later that same year, the board of directors announced that planning applications were to be put forward to the council authority, making the Liberty Stadium the largest sportsclub-owned stadium in Wales.
The Liberty Stadium was renamed the Swansea.com Stadium on 9 August 2021, following a 10-year naming rights agreement.
Rivalries.
Swansea City's main rivals are <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a>, with the rivalry described as among the most hostile in British football. Matches between these two clubs are known as the <a href="South%20Wales%20derby">South Wales derbies</a> and are usually one of the highlights of the season for both sets of supporters. It was only from the late 1960s that the rivalry became marked. Before then fans of the two clubs often had a degree of affection for their Welsh neighbouring team.
Swansea City's other rivals are <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> and <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>. However, Swansea very rarely meet Newport as they are currently separated by two divisions, while the two clubs share a mutual rivalry with Cardiff City.
Swansea have won 42 of the 115 competitive meetings, compared to Cardiff's 45, who also have the biggest result between the two sides with Swansea losing 5–0 in 1965, with a further 28 drawn; neither team had done the double, until the 2021–22 season where Swansea had completed the first ever double in the 110 year rivalry, beating Cardiff 3-0 and 0–4 home and away. Following Swansea City's promotion to the Championship, the clubs were drawn in the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> which would be the first meeting between both sides for nine years. Swansea City won the tie with a solitary goal from a deflected free-kick taken by <a href="Jordi%20G%C3%B3mez">Jordi Gómez</a>. The match saw sets of supporters from both clubs clash with police after the match. The next two league games both finished in 2–2 draws. However, the derby game at <a href="Ninian%20Park">Ninian Park</a> was marred with controversy as referee <a href="Mike%20Dean%20%28referee%29">Mike Dean</a> was struck by a coin from a Cardiff City supporter.
In the 2009–10 season, Swansea beat Cardiff 3–2 at the Liberty Stadium in November, before losing 2–1 in Cardiff in April after a late <a href="Michael%20Chopra">Michael Chopra</a> strike. With Swansea and Cardiff both pushing for promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the first derby at the new <a href="Cardiff%20City%20Stadium">Cardiff City Stadium</a>, and the first Cardiff win in nine meetings between the sides, was billed as being the biggest South Wales derby of all time, in respect to the league positions of the teams and how close it came to the end of the season. Despite their promising league positions leading up to the derby, neither side gained promotion at the end of that campaign, and so the South Wales derby was once again played out at Championship level during the 2010–11 season – Swansea beating Cardiff 1–0 away with a late winner from then on-loan <a href="Marvin%20Emnes">Marvin Emnes</a> before losing their home game due to a late strike from <a href="Craig%20Bellamy">Craig Bellamy</a>.
Following Swansea's promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2010–11 season, the South Wales derby was again put on hiatus. It would be two seasons before the sides met once more, this time on the worldwide stage of the Premier League. On 3 November 2013, Cardiff took the bragging rights in the first ever Premier League South Wales derby, enjoying a 1–0 win courtesy of ex-Swan <a href="Steven%20Caulker">Steven Caulker</a> at the Cardiff City Stadium. The return fixture for that season took place on 8 February 2014 at Swansea's Liberty Stadium, a match in which interim player-manager Garry Monk would make his managerial debut following the sacking of Michael Laudrup. The Swans took revenge for the defeat earlier in the season with a convincing 3–0 win.
The sides met again during the 2019–20 season in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>; Swansea won 1–0 in the first fixture at the Liberty Stadium. In the 2020–21 season, Jamal Lowe scored a brace in a 2-0 Swansea win. In October 2021, Swansea won 3–0 against Cardiff. Later in the season, Swansea beat Cardiff 4–0 in the reverse fixture; Swansea became the first side to complete the league double in the derby's 110-year history.

They play their home games at the <a href="MKM%20Stadium">MKM Stadium</a>, after moving from <a href="Boothferry%20Park">Boothferry Park</a> in 2002. The club's traditional home colours are black and amber, often featuring in a striped design on the shirt, hence their nickname, "the Tigers". Hull also contest the <a href="Humber%20derby">Humber derby</a> with both <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> and <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a>.
The club was founded in 1904 and was then admitted into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> a year later. They remained in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> until relegation in 1930. Hull won the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a> title in 1932–33, but were relegated three years later. They won the Third Division North under the stewardship of <a href="Raich%20Carter">Raich Carter</a> in 1948–49, and this time remained in the second tier for seven seasons. Having been promoted again in 1958–59, they were relegated the following season and remained in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> until they were promoted as champions under <a href="Cliff%20Britton">Cliff Britton</a> in 1965–66. Twelve seasons in the second tier culminated in two relegations in four years by 1981. They were promoted from the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> at the end of the 1982–83 campaign and were beaten finalists in the inaugural <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Associate Members' Cup</a> in <a href="1984%20Associate%20Members%27%20Cup%20Final">1984</a>.
Hull were relegated in 1991 and again in 1996, but secured back-to-back promotions in 2003–04 and 2004–05. The club went on to win the <a href="2008%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">2008 play-off final</a> against <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> to win a place in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> for the first time. They were relegated after two seasons, but were promoted again from the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> in 2012–13. Hull played in their first <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> final in <a href="2014%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2014</a>, who despite scoring twice early on, lost 3–2 to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra-time</a>. Relegated from the Premier League the following year, they returned for a third time with victory in the <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">2016 play-off final</a>. They were relegated again from the top-flight just a year later, before dropping into the third tier in 2020. Hull secured immediate promotion as champions of <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> at the end of the 2020–21 campaign.
History.
Foundation and early progress (1904–1945).
Hull City Association Football Club was founded in June 1904. Previous attempts to found an <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Kingston upon Hull</a> had proved difficult due to the popularity of <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> in the city. By 1904, both <a href="Hull%20F.C.">Hull F.C.</a> and <a href="Hull%20Kingston%20Rovers">Hull K.R.</a> were already well-established sides with passionate local backing. The desire for a third team to represent the city in competitive sport was not particularly present at the time, but support would soon grow. The club faced some initial disruptions after foundation, as they had been unable to apply for membership of the <a href="the%20Football%20League">Football League</a> for the <a href="1904%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">1904–05</a> season and instead played only in friendlies. The first of these matches was a 2–2 draw with <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> on 1 September 1904, with a crowd of 6,000 in attendance. These early matches were played at Hull F.C.'s home, <a href="The%20Boulevard%20%28stadium%29">the Boulevard</a>. The club's first competitive football match was in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> preliminary round, drawing 3–3 with <a href="Stockton%20F.C.">Stockton</a> on 17 September, but they were eliminated after losing the replay 4–1 on 22 September.
After disputes with landlords at the Boulevard, Hull City temporarily moved to <a href="The%20Circle%20%28Kingston%20upon%20Hull%29">the Circle</a>, a <a href="cricket">cricket</a> ground in West Park. After having played 44 friendly fixtures the previous season, Hull City were admitted into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a> for the <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">1905–06 season</a>. Other teams competing in the league that season included <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, as well as Yorkshire rivals <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a>, <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a> and <a href="Leeds%20City%20F.C.">Leeds City</a>. Furthermore, <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a>, from the southern bank of the <a href="Humber">Humber Estuary</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, were also in the Second Division. Interestingly, Hull and Grimsby were the only two professional teams who were granted official exemption from playing league football on <a href="Christmas%20Day">Christmas Day</a> because of the demands of the fish trade. Hull defeated Barnsley 4–1 at home in their first game, and ended the season with a solid 5th-place finish.
In March 1906, a permanent home ground was opened for Hull City just across the road from the cricket ground, known as <a href="Anlaby%20Road">Anlaby Road</a>. It would house the team until 1939. Under the guidance of <a href="Player-coach">player-manager</a> <a href="Ambrose%20Langley">Ambrose Langley</a>, Hull continued to finish consistently in the top-half of the table. They came agonisingly close to promotion in the <a href="1909%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">1909–10</a> season, recording what would be the club's highest-ever league finish for nearly a century. Hull had ended the season level on points with <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a>, but finished below the Latics due to goal average, where a narrow margin of 0.29 of a goal had meant the Tigers missed out on promotion.
Hull would continue to regularly finish in the top-half of the table prior to the suspension of English football during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, but their momentum had gone after its restart in 1919. The Tigers began to struggle, finishing in the bottom half of the table in seven seasons out of the next eleven. This culminated in <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a> following the <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20in%20English%20football">1929–30</a> season. Despite the league campaign ending in relegation, Hull found much better luck in the FA Cup. Prior to 2014, Hull's greatest result in any cup competition was achieved in the <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20FA%20Cup">1929–30 FA Cup</a>. The Tigers began with victories over the eventual champions of the Third Division, <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a> and the eventual champions of the Second Division, <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a>. They then overcame <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> to meet <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> in the quarter-finals. The first game at <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a> finished as a 1–1 draw, but, in the home replay, Hull beat Newcastle 1–0. This meant Hull played the semi-finals, where they were paired with <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, in a game held at the <a href="neutral%20venue">neutral venue</a> of <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a> in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>. The semi-final ended 2–2, and, so, was replayed at <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a> in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> four days later. Arsenal won the semi-final replay 1–0, thus ending Hull's <a href="Glossary%20of%20association%20football%20terms">cup run</a>.
Hull would eventually be promoted back to the Second Division after they won their first-ever league title in the <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20Football%20League%23Third%20Division%20North">1932–33</a> season. Managed by <a href="Haydn%20Green">Haydn Green</a>, they had finished above 2nd-placed <a href="Wrexham%20A.F.C.">Wrexham</a> by just 2 points, mainly due to the goals of <a href="Bill%20McNaughton">Bill McNaughton</a> who was the league's top-scorer that season with 39 goals.
Lower-league success and financial crisis (1945–1985).
After the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, the club moved to another new ground, <a href="Boothferry%20Park">Boothferry Park</a>. In the <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20in%20English%20football">1948–49</a> season, under the tutelage of former England international and now <a href="Player-coach">player-manager</a> <a href="Raich%20Carter">Raich Carter</a>, Hull won promotion from the Third Division North as champions. "<a href="Yo-yo%20club">Yo-yoing</a>" between the second and third tiers of <a href="English%20football">English football</a>, City had promotion seasons from the Third Division to the Second Division again in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a> and <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20in%20English%20football">1965–66</a>, winning the Third Division title in the latter-season. For the majority of the 1960s, Hull was managed by <a href="Cliff%20Britton">Cliff Britton</a>, who has since achieved cult-status with supporters of the club for the successes he achieved, especially the Third Division title win in 1966. The side that year featured record club appearance-maker <a href="Andy%20Davidson%20%28footballer%29">Jock Davidson</a> and record club goal-scorer <a href="Chris%20Chilton">Chris Chilton</a> as well as <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Striker">striker</a> <a href="Ken%20Houghton">Ken Houghton</a> and a young <a href="Ken%20Wagstaff">Ken Wagstaff</a>, among others. It is widely regarded as one of the best squads the club has ever had.
On 1 August 1970, Hull became the first team in the world to be eliminated from a cup competition on <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a>, beaten by Manchester United in the semi-final of the <a href="Watney%20Cup">Watney Cup</a>.
By the early 1980s, Hull City were in the Fourth Division, and financial collapse led to <a href="receivership">receivership</a>. Don Robinson took over as chairman and appointed <a href="Colin%20Appleton">Colin Appleton</a> as the new manager. Both had previously held the equivalent roles with non-league <a href="Scarborough%20F.C.">Scarborough</a>. Promotion to the Third Division followed in 1983, with a young team featuring such players as future England international <a href="Brian%20Marwood">Brian Marwood</a>, future England manager <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a>, <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">forwards</a> <a href="Billy%20Whitehurst">Billy Whitehurst</a> and <a href="Les%20Mutrie">Les Mutrie</a>, and Hull-born future captain <a href="Garreth%20Roberts">Garreth Roberts</a>.
In February 1983, City fans <a href="Henry%20Priestman">Henry Priestman</a> as Harry Amber and <a href="Mark%20Herman">Mark Herman</a> as Mark Black worked together as Amber and Black to release the song "The Tigers are Back", with backing vocals provided by members of the City squad. This was done to help raise funds in order to pay the players' wages, as the effects of the previous seasons money struggles were still visible. Herman reworded the song "Out of Luck" by Priestman's previous band <a href="Yachts%20%28band%29">Yachts</a>, to get the lyrics. The record sleeves and records contained the made up record label logo Don Records in tribute to Don Robinson, and the made up issue number COL001 in tribute to Colin Appleton.
After narrowly missing out on back-to-back promotions in May 1984, Appleton left his position at Hull, having been enticed to become the new manager of <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a>. His replacement was <a href="Player-coach">player-manager</a> <a href="Brian%20Horton">Brian Horton</a> who would first join the Tigers on their summer tour of Florida the following month, where they visited <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Walt Disney World</a>, and played the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Rowdies%20%281975%E2%80%931993%29">Tampa Bay Rowdies</a>, managed by <a href="Rodney%20Marsh">Rodney Marsh</a>, in the return leg of the <a href="Arrow%20Air">Arrow Air Anglo-American Cup</a>. Mark Herman would direct and edit a short <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> of the tour, with Priestman composing its music. Herman released the finished version online in 2016, titled "A Kick in the Grass". Promotion followed in the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85</a> season under Horton, with the young City squad now not only talented but experienced too.
Fall to the fourth tier (1985–2000).
Hull remained in the Second Division for the next six years before being relegated in 1991, by which time the club's manager was <a href="Terry%20Dolan%20%28football%20manager%29">Terry Dolan</a>. The Tigers finished 14th in the Third Division in the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92</a> season, meaning that they would be competing in the new Second Division the following season. In their first season in the rebranded division, Hull narrowly avoided another relegation, but the board kept faith in Dolan and over the next two seasons they achieved mid-table finishes. Financial difficulties hampered City's progress, as key players such as <a href="Alan%20Fettis">Alan Fettis</a> and <a href="Dean%20Windass">Dean Windass</a> had to be sold to fend off <a href="Liquidation">winding-up orders</a>. In the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96</a> season, Hull were relegated to the Third Division.
In 1997, former tennis player <a href="David%20Lloyd%20%28tennis%29">David Lloyd</a> purchased the club. Lloyd sacked Dolan as manager, and replaced him with <a href="Mark%20Hateley">Mark Hateley</a>, after Hull finished 17th in the league table. Hull's league form steadily deteriorated to the point that they faced possible relegation to the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a>. Lloyd sold the club in November 1998 to a South Yorkshire-based consortium, but retained ownership of Boothferry Park. Hateley departed in November 1998, with the club at the foot of the table. He was replaced by 34-year-old veteran player <a href="Warren%20Joyce">Warren Joyce</a>, who steered the club to safety with games to spare. Hull City fans refer to this season as "The Great Escape". Despite this feat, Joyce was replaced in April 2000 by the more experienced <a href="Brian%20Little%20%28footballer%29">Brian Little</a>.
Despite briefly being locked out of Boothferry Park by bailiffs and facing the possibility of liquidation, Hull qualified for the Third Division play-offs in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a> season, losing in the semi-finals to Leyton Orient. A boardroom takeover by former Leeds United commercial director <a href="Adam%20Pearson%20%28sports%20executive%29">Adam Pearson</a> eased the club's precarious financial situation, and all fears of closure were banished.
Rise to the top-flight (2000–2008).
The new chairman funded the club, allowing Little to rebuild the team. Hull occupied the Third Division promotion and play-off places for much of the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">2001–02</a> season, but Little departed two months before the end of the season and Hull slipped to 11th place under his successor <a href="Jan%20M%C3%B8lby">Jan Mølby</a>, incidentally the club's first non-British or Irish manager.
Hull began the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2002–03</a> season with a number of defeats, which saw relegation look more likely than promotion, and Mølby was sacked in October as Hull languished in 19th. <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201953%29">Peter Taylor</a> was named as Hull's new manager, and, in December 2002, just two months after Taylor's appointment and after 56 years at <a href="Boothferry%20Park">Boothferry Park</a>, Hull relocated to the new <a href="MKM%20Stadium">KC Stadium</a>. At the end of the season Hull finished 13th.
Hull were Third Division runners-up in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2003–04</a> and League One runners-up in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2004–05</a>. These back-to-back promotions took City into the Championship, the second tier of English football. The <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2005–06</a> season, the club's first back in the second tier, saw Hull finish in 18th place, 10 points clear of relegation and their highest league finish for 16 years (since 1989–90).
However, Taylor left the club to take up the manager's job at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>, with <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a>'s <a href="Phil%20Parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> confirmed as his replacement, but he was sacked on 4 December 2006 with Hull in the relegation zone, despite having spent over £2 million on players during the summer. <a href="Phil%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201959%29">Phil Brown</a> took over as <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker manager</a>, and took over permanently in January 2007, having taken Hull out of the relegation zone. Brown brought veteran striker <a href="Dean%20Windass">Dean Windass</a> back to his hometown club on loan from Bradford City, and his eight goals helped secure Hull's Championship status, with a 21st-placed finish.
Adam Pearson sold the club to a consortium led by <a href="Paul%20Duffen">Paul Duffen</a> in June 2007, stating that he "had taken the club as far as I could", and would have to relinquish control in order to attract "really significant finance into the club". Under Paul Duffen and manager Phil Brown, Hull City improved greatly on their relegation battle of <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2006–07</a> and qualified for the play-offs after finishing the season in third. They beat <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a> 6–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals and played <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> in the <a href="2008%20Football%20League%20Championship%20playoff%20final">final</a> on 24 May 2008. Hull won 1–0 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, with Hull-born player Dean Windass scoring the winning goal. Their ascent from the bottom division of the Football League to the top division of English football in just five seasons was the third-fastest in England, behind joint-first Swansea (1977–81) and Wimbledon (1982–86).
On 1 January 2008, midway through Hull City's promotion season, Amber and Black (now stylised as Amber & Black), released the song "The City's on Fire" on <a href="Myspace">MySpace</a>. It was their first Hull City song since 1983. It was later re-released just before <a href="2014%20FA%20Cup%20final">2014 FA Cup final</a>.
Premier League football and "yo-yo" years (2008–2016).
, Hull began life in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> by beating <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> 2–1 on the opening day, in their first-ever top-flight fixture. Having gone 1–0 down inside 10 minutes, <a href="Geovanni">Geovanni</a> scored Hull's first-ever top-flight goal, from outside the <a href="Penalty%20area">box</a>, to equalise. <a href="Caleb%20Folan">Caleb Folan</a> then won the match late on, after <a href="Craig%20Fagan">Craig Fagan</a> capitalised on a defensive mishap by <a href="Paul%20Konchesky">Paul Konchesky</a>. With only one defeat in their opening nine games, including away wins at <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> and <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, the Tigers temporarily found themselves joint-top of the Premier League table on points (albeit sat in 3rd place due to goal difference) following a 3–0 victory over <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. Hull's form never replicated the highs of the early autumn, as they only won two more games over the remainder of the campaign, but secured their top-flight status on the last day of the season due to other results going in their favour.
On 29 October 2009, chairman Paul Duffen resigned his position with the club, and was replaced by former chairman Adam Pearson on 2 November 2009. On 15 March 2010, manager Phil Brown was put on <a href="gardening%20leave">gardening leave</a> after a run of four defeats left Hull in the relegation zone. Brown's replacement was former Crystal Palace and Charlton boss <a href="Iain%20Dowie">Iain Dowie</a>, and the appointment was met with some disbelief by supporters who were hoping for a "bigger name" replacement. Hull City's relegation from the Premier League was confirmed on 3 May 2010, after a 2–2 draw at <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>. Both Brown and Dowie had their contracts terminated, and <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>'s <a href="Nigel%20Pearson">Nigel Pearson</a> was confirmed as the new manager.
A reported block on player transfers into the club, set in place by the Hull City board on 28 July 2010 until transfers out would substantially reduce the £39 million-per-year wage bill, cast doubt on the new manager's efforts to build a squad capable of a quick return to the Premier League. Nevertheless, Pearson brought several transfers and loan signings into the club in his bid to strengthen the squad for the season's campaign. On 16 December 2010, it was confirmed that <a href="Assem%20Allam">Assem Allam</a> had become the new owner of Hull City, having promised to pay back club debts and eliminate any possibility of financial ruin. This allowed the team to spend more money in the following January window, bringing in several new transfers and short-term loans, including the notable arrival of <a href="Matty%20Fryatt">Matty Fryatt</a> from <a href="Leicester%20City">Leicester City</a> for £1.2 million. The newly-revitalised team set a new club record on 12 March 2011 with 14 away matches unbeaten, breaking a previous record held for over 50 years. This 17-match streak was finally broken by Bristol City on the last day of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2010–11 season</a>, with Hull losing the match 3–0.
On 15 November 2011, Nigel Pearson left the club to return to Leicester. Hull-born former club player <a href="Nick%20Barmby">Nick Barmby</a> was appointed as his successor, initially as a temporary <a href="Player-coach">player-manager</a>, but later as the full-time head coach, after retiring from professional football in January 2012. Barmby was sacked in May 2012, after publicly criticising the club's owners in an interview given to a local newspaper. In the same month, the club's consultancy agreement with Adam Pearson was terminated. On 8 June 2012, <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> was appointed manager of Hull City on a three-year deal, an appointment which would prove pivotal for the club's history. To begin, Bruce guided Hull back to the Premier League in his first campaign as manager, the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2012–13 season</a>. Hull did so by securing a draw with league champion <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> on the now-infamous final day, and then required a late <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> goal to fend off <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>'s attempt to dislodge them from second place in the league table.
The following season, on 13 April 2014, the club reached its first <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> after defeating <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> 5–3 in the semi-final at Wembley Stadium. Their place in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2014–15 UEFA Europa League</a>, regardless of whether they won the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20FA%20Cup">2013–14 FA Cup</a>, was confirmed on 3 May as <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>'s failure to win meant that Hull's FA Cup Final opponents Arsenal would compete in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2014–15 UEFA Champions League</a>, leaving Hull to enter into the Europa League third qualifying round, in their first-ever European campaign. The <a href="2014%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> on 17 May 2014 saw Hull go 2–0 up within the first ten minutes, thanks to goals from centre-backs <a href="James%20Chester">James Chester</a> and <a href="Curtis%20Davies">Curtis Davies</a>, before eventually losing 3–2 after extra time.
On 31 July 2014, Hull made their debut in European competition, in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League third qualifying round</a>, with a 0–0 draw against Slovakian side <a href="FK%20AS%20Tren%C4%8D%C3%ADn">FK AS Trenčín</a> before winning the second leg 2–1 a week later. An error from gaolkeeper <a href="Allan%20McGregor">Allan McGregor</a> meant Hull lost 1–0 away to Belgian club <a href="K.S.C.%20Lokeren%20Oost-Vlaanderen">KSC Lokeren</a> in the first leg of their play-off tie, played on 21 August 2014. Hull did manage to achieve a 2–1 victory in the second leg at home, but the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a> meant the Tigers lost the tie, marking the end of their first foray into European football.
In March 2015, manager Steve Bruce signed his second three-year deal with the club. Hull were relegated from the Premier League after the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a>, finishing 18th with 35 points. Relegation had been confirmed after Hull drew 0–0 at home to Manchester United and fellow relegation-candidates <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> beat <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> 2–0 to survive the drop. On 27 October 2015, Hull beat eventual Premier League champions <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> in a penalty-shootout to take them through to their first-ever quarter-final appearance in the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a>. Later <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">that season</a>, Hull reached the <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23Semi-finals">Championship play-offs</a>, in the semi-final of which they beat <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> 3–2 on aggregate, adavancing to the <a href="2016%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20final">final</a>, against <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> on 28 May 2016. Hull secured an immediate return to the Premier League by winning that game 1–0, with <a href="Mohamed%20Diam%C3%A9">Mohamed Diamé</a> scoring a long-range effort in the second half.
Supporter unrest and steady decline (2016–2021).
On 22 July 2016, Bruce resigned from his position as manager due to an alleged rift with the club's owners and <a href="Mike%20Phelan">Mike Phelan</a> was appointed caretaker manager. Steve Bruce's four-year tenure as Hull City manager is one of the most successful in the Tigers’ history, as his team achieved two promotions to the Premier League, including the club's highest-ever league finish, as well as an FA Cup final and European football. By the summer of 2016, supporters had been frustrated with several aspects of the Allam family's ownership of the club prior to this point (mainly the failed suggestion for the club to be rebranded as <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%23Name%20change">Hull Tigers</a>), but the fall-out after Bruce's resignation alongside no new signings made since promotion had sharpened the idea of the club being sold. Attendances at home games dropped in protest of the Allams' ownership, but on-pitch results were surprisingly good considering the club's uncomfortable situation. This was highlighted by an infamous opening day 2–1 win at home to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>, the reigning Premier League champions at the time. Although good results continued until September, Hull's form quickly dipped. Despite this, on 13 October 2016, Phelan became Hull's permanent head coach, but was sacked less than 3 months later, on 3 January 2017, after little improvement. Two days later, <a href="Marco%20Silva">Marco Silva</a> was appointed as Phelan's replacement, but he was unable prevent relegation at the end of the season.
Following relegation Silva resigned, and on 9 June 2017, the club announced the appointment of <a href="Leonid%20Slutsky%20%28football%20coach%29">Leonid Slutsky</a> as the new head coach. However, after a poor run of results Slutsky left by mutual consent in December 2017. He was replaced by former-<a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> boss <a href="Nigel%20Adkins">Nigel Adkins</a>, who led the team to avoid relegation and finish 18th at the end of the season. The following season, despite being in the relegation zone after 19 games, an upturn in form saw the Tigers finish in 13th place. However, Adkins resigned at the end of the season after rejecting a new contract. On 21 June 2019, Hull apppointed <a href="Grant%20McCann">Grant McCann</a> as head coach on a one-year <a href="Rolling%20%28finance%29">rolling contract</a>. In a season delayed due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom</a>, the Tigers started well but lost 16 of their last 20 games, a run that included Hull's joint-worst league defeat ever, when they lost 8–0 away at <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>. On 22 July 2020, after a 3–0 away loss to <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a>, Hull were relegated to League One. It would be the first time the club had played in the third tier of English football in fifteen years.
Return to the Championship and new ownership (2021–present).
Despite relegation, McCann continued as head coach for the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2020–21 season</a>. This decision would prove successful as on 24 April 2021, Hull were promoted back to the Championship at the first time of asking after a 2–1 victory away at <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a>. A week later, on the final day of the campaign, a 3–1 win at home to <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> confirmed Hull as League One champion for the season. It was only the fourth-ever league title that the club had won, and the most recent since the victorious <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20in%20English%20football">1965–66</a> Third Division campaign, 55 years prior.
On 19 January 2022, after months of negotiations and speculation, Turkish media mogul <a href="Acun%20Il%C4%B1cal%C4%B1">Acun Ilıcalı</a> and his company <a href="Acun%20Medya">Acun Medya</a>, completed a takeover of the club, ending the club's controversial 11-year ownership under the Allam family. The club sat 19th in the Championship at the time that the takeover was announced. On 25 January 2022, manager Grant McCann and his assistant <a href="Cliff%20Byrne">Cliff Byrne</a> left the club. On 27 January 2022, Hull announced <a href="Shota%20Arveladze">Shota Arveladze</a> as the new head coach. Hull achieved Championship survival in the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2021–22</a> season with a 19th-placed finish. On 30 September 2022, Hull sacked Arveladze after four consecutive defeats in the league, and appointed <a href="Andy%20Dawson">Andy Dawson</a> as interim head coach. On 3 November 2022, the club announced former player, <a href="Liam%20Rosenior">Liam Rosenior</a>, as head coach, on a two-and-a-half-year deal. Having strengthened both the team's defensive record and the team's away record since his arrival, Rosenior guided Hull to a 15th-placed finish at the end of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2022–23</a> season.
Club identity.
Colours and crest.
For most of the club's history, Hull have worn black and amber shirts with black shorts. These black and amber colours are where Hull's nickname, "The Tigers", originated from. However, in the club's first match against Notts County in 1904, white shirts were worn, with black shorts and black socks. During their first season in the League, Hull wore black and amber striped shirts and black shorts, which they continued to wear until the Second World War, with the exception of the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20in%20English%20football">1935–36</a> season, in which they wore bright blue shirts.
Following the end of the Second World War, Hull wore sky blue home shirts for the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20in%20English%20football">1946–47</a> season, but changed to plain amber shirts, which they wore until the early 1960s, when they swapped back to stripes. During the mid-1970s, and early 1980s, the strip was constantly changing between the two versions of plain shirts and stripes. During the late 1980s, red was added to the kits but its duration went no further than this. The early 1990s featured two distinctive "tiger skin" designs, which have since featured in several articles listing the "worst ever" football kits.
The <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1998–99</a> season introduced a kit with cross-fading amber and white stripes, another experiment that proved unpopular. After the start of the 21st century, the club wore plain amber shirts until 2004, when the club celebrated its centenary by wearing a kit similar to the design of the one worn 100 years previously.
In 1935, Hull City's introduced its first-ever shirt crest, which mirrored the familiar three crowns civic emblem of Kingston upon Hull. This was displayed on the bright blue shirts worn in the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20in%20English%20football">1935–36</a> season. Following that season, the team went without a crest until 1947, when a tiger's head in an amber shield was used. In 1957, it changed again, this time to just the tiger's head. This was worn for another three years, until the shirt returned to having no crest. Then, in 1971, the club brought back the tiger's head on the shirt, which was used for four years.
In 1975, the tiger's head was granted as a <a href="heraldic%20badge">heraldic badge</a> by the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> for use by Hull City, blazoned as a "Bengal tiger's head erased proper". Subsequently, the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years on the shirt. After this, a crest with the tiger's head with the club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next crest, which was in use throughout Hull's historic rise from the fourth tier, featured the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, "The Tigers".
The club would change their crest again in June 2014, but this version was not well-liked among supporters and so from the close of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2017–18</a> season a supporter-led process of redesigning the club crest took place. The new crest was to be used from the start of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Hull%20City%20A.F.C.%20season">2019–20</a> season, being revealed in February 2019. This would be similar to the previous design but with the return of the club name at the top and a different shaped shield.
Grounds.
Between 1904 and 1905, Hull City played their home games at <a href="The%20Boulevard%20%28stadium%29">the Boulevard</a>. This ground was used by Hull on a contract which allowed them to use it when not used for Rugby League, at a cost of £100 per annum. Hull built their own ground, <a href="Anlaby%20Road">Anlaby Road</a>, which was opened in 1906. With the threat of the rerouting of the railway line through the Anlaby Road ground, the club was convinced it needed to secure its future by owning its own ground. They negotiated the deal for land between Boothferry Road and North Road in 1929, which was financed by a £3,000 loan from the FA. Due to the club's financial difficulties, no work took place for three years, and development then stopped until 1939. In that year a proposal to build a new multi-purpose sports stadium on the site temporarily halted the club's plans to relocate, but when this plan failed the club resolved to continue with the stalled development of the site, in anticipation of moving to the new stadium in 1940. The outbreak of war, however, meant that the redevelopment again came to a halt, as the site was taken over by the <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a>.
During the Second World War, Anlaby Road was damaged by enemy bombing, the repair cost of which was in the region of £1,000. The Cricket Club served notice to quit at the same time, and so in 1943 the tenancy was officially ended. Hull were forced to return to the Boulevard Ground from 1944 until 1945 because of the poor condition of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road. The new stadium was finally opened under the revised name of <a href="Boothferry%20Park">Boothferry Park</a> on 31 August 1946.
Hull City moved into the newly built <a href="KC%20Stadium">KC Stadium</a> alongside Hull F.C. in 2002. The KC Stadium was named "Best Ground" at the 2006 Football League Awards.
Rivalries.
Hull City are one of very few clubs in <a href="Football%20in%20England">English football</a> to have no clear rival. Hull do contest the <a href="Humber%20Derby">Humber Derby</a> with both <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> and <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a>, however they are both <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> clubs and generally consider each other as their main rivals, rather than Hull.
According to a 2003 poll, Hull fans consider their main rival to be Yorkshire neighbours <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>, although this appears to be one-sided as Leeds have much stronger rivalries with other clubs, including <a href="Bradford%20City%20F.C.">Bradford City</a>, <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>.
The club also has a minor rivalry with <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>. This goes back to 1984 when United won promotion at Hull's expense. With the teams level on points and on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>, they were only separated by goals scored. Interestingly, 33 of United's goals were scored by former Hull striker <a href="Keith%20Edwards%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201957%29">Keith Edwards</a>. Hull's final game of the season against <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> had been rescheduled due to bad weather and took place after their promotion rivals had finished their campaign. This meant Hull went into the game knowing that a three-goal victory would mean promotion, but in front of a crowd which included a number of United fans, they could manage only a 2–0 win, ensuring that United went up instead.
Additionally, the 2003 poll found that <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a> and non-league <a href="York%20City%20F.C.">York City</a> fans considered Hull to be amongst their rivals.
According to Andy Nicholls and Nick Lowles, in their book "Hooligans: The A–L of Britain's Football Hooligan Gangs", the club's main <a href="Football%20hooliganism">hooligan firm</a> appears to be the <a href="Hull%20City%20Psychos">Hull City Psychos</a>, dating back to the 1960s.
Name change.
2013: Initial application.
In August 2013, owner Assem Allam announced that the club had re-registered as "Hull City Tigers Ltd," and that the team would be marketed as "Hull City Tigers," removing the "Association Football Club" that had been part of the name since the club's formation in 1904. Vice-chairman Ehab Allam said "AFC" would remain on the club badge for the <a href="2013-14%20Premier%20League">2013–14 season</a>, but be removed after.
In response, a Premier League spokesman said, "We have not been informed of a change in the name of the actual club. They will still be known as Hull City as far as the Premier League is concerned when results or fixtures are published."
According to its chairman, by 2014, the club would be further renamed "Hull Tigers," because, as he claimed, "in marketing, the shorter the name the more powerful [it is]," while "Association Football Club" made the name too long. Allam stated he dislikes the word "City", as it is too "common" and a "lousy identity", since it is associated also with other clubs, such as Leicester City, Bristol City and Manchester City. He told <a href="David%20Conn">David Conn</a> of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" that "in a few years many clubs will follow and change their names to something more interesting and I will have proved I am a leader," adding that if he were the owner of Manchester City, he would change their name to "Manchester Hunter."
Allam justified the intended name change as part of his plans to create "additional sources of revenue" for the club, after <a href="Hull%20City%20Council">Hull City Council</a> refused to sell him the stadium <a href="Freehold%20%28law%29">freehold</a> so he could develop, as he had stated, "a sports park" on the site. The council has refused to sell in order, as they stated, "to preserve the annual <a href="Hull%20Fair">Hull Fair</a> held on the adjacent car park." After the collapse of the negotiations, Allam stated: "I had in mind £30 million to spend on the infrastructure of the club, to increase the stadium by 10,000 and to have commercial activities around the stadium — cafeterias, shops, supermarkets — to have all this to create income for the club so that in the future it can be self-financing and not relying on me." He asked <a href="Rhetorical%20question">rhetorically</a>, "What if I dropped dead tomorrow?"
Supporters' groups expressed opposition to the name change. Bernard Noble, chairman of Hull City's official supporters club said he was disappointed, although he agreed that Allam had saved the club from liquidation and that it was "his club". Blogger Rick Skelton called the name change "a pointless exercise" and said, "Mr Allam's assertion that the name 'Hull City' is irrelevant and too common, is as disgusting a use of the English language as his new name for the club." Before the first home match of the season on 24 August 2013, a group of supporters marched in protest against the name change, and unfurled a banner that read, "Hull City AFC: a club not a brand". Allam dismissed complaints by fans, stating "nobody questions my decisions in my business."
In a comment published on 1 December 2013 in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" in response to supporters' chants and banners of "City Till We Die", Allam said, "They can die as soon as they want, as long as they leave the club for the majority who just want to watch good football." The supporters responded with chants of "We're Hull City, we'll die when we want" during that day's home match against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Manager Steve Bruce credited the controversy for creating " a fantastic atmosphere" but added, "I have got to have a conversation with him because I don't think he quite understands what it means in terms of history and tradition." However, Bruce also said that, because of the money Allam had invested in the club, "If he thinks Hull Tigers is his way forward then we have to respect it."
On 11 December 2013, a spokesman for Hull City announced that the club had formally applied to the <a href="Football%20Association">Football Association</a> to have its name changed to "Hull Tigers" from the 2014–15 season onwards. The <a href="FA%20Council">FA Council</a>, which has "absolute discretion" in deciding whether to approve the plan or not, stated the next day that it would follow a "consultation process" with <a href="Stakeholder%20%28corporate%29%23Applications%20of%20the%20term">stakeholder</a>s, "including the club's supporter groups".
2014: Resistance and rejection.
Some brand and marketing experts came out in support of the name change. Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, stated that "the whole process has been conducted badly with the supporters, but [the name change] is a pretty sound idea." Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the <a href="Coventry%20University%20Business%20School">Coventry University Business School</a>, opined that the objective of opening up lucrative new markets for shirt sales, merchandise and broadcast deals shows commercial vision and could bring benefits, but "this needs to be backed up by a proper marketing strategy and investment." He said, "it's no use thinking changing the name or the colour of the shirt will pay instant dividends." <a href="David%20Stern">David Stern</a>, <a href="Commissioner%20of%20the%20NBA">commissioner</a> of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> in the United States, warned: "I would say a wise owner [of a sports club] would view his ownership as something of a public trust, in addition to the profit motive, and you really do want to allow the fans a little bit more input than I think is being allowed, with respect to Hull."
On 17 March 2014, the FA membership committee advised that the name change application be rejected at the FA Council meeting on 9 April. In response, the club published a statement saying the FA was "prejudiced", and criticised the committee's consultation with the City Till We Die opposition group. The following week, the club opened a ballot of <a href="Season%20ticket%23Sport">season ticket holders</a> over the name change. Opponents of the name change criticised as "loaded" the questions, which asked respondents to choose between "Yes to Hull Tigers with the Allam family continuing to lead the club", "No to Hull Tigers" and "I am not too concerned and will continue to support the club either way", on the grounds that voters were not given the option to reject the name while keeping the Allam family as owners. Of 15,033 season ticket holders, 5,874 voted in all, with 2,565 voting in favour of the change and 2,517 against, while 792 chose the "not too concerned" option.
On 9 April 2014, the FA Council announced its decision, carried by a 63.5% vote of its members, to reject the club's application for a name change. The club's owner, Assam Allem, responded by stating it would appeal the decision. However, since there was no appeal process with the FA and its Council, the decision was final. On 11 September 2014, Allam mentioned that an appeal against the FA's ruling was being sent to the <a href="Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport">Court of Arbitration for Sport</a>. He also held a news conference confirming the club had been put up for sale due to the English FA's decision on 9 April 2014.
In October 2014, interviewed by the BBC, Allam confirmed that he would "not invest a penny more in the club" unless he is allowed to change the club's name to Hull Tigers. In the same interview, Allam said, "I have never been a football fan. I am still not a football fan. I am a community fan."
2015: Re-application.
In March 2015, an independent panel appointed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that the decision of the Football Association Council to block the name change "cannot stand" on account of the process having been "flawed."
In July 2015, the Football Supporters Federation confirmed that a 70/30 decision was made in favour of Hull City A.F.C. not changing their name after an FA vote.
Finances.
In the club's <a href="annual%20report">annual report</a> for the 12-month period up to 31 July 2009, <a href="auditor">auditor</a>s <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a> stated that <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>4.4 million had gone out of the club and stadium company to owner <a href="Russell%20Bartlett">Russell Bartlett</a>'s holding companies in loans, while at least £2.9 million of it was used in the take-over itself of the club. A further £560,000 was paid, according to the audit, by the stadium company to Bartlett's holding companies in "management fees," while at least £1 million was owed to him personally as a "salary". After the warning from Deloitte, Bartlett gave the club a £4 million loan, "which brought the money he had taken out and put in since taking over to about even."
The <a href="Corporation">corporate entity</a> that owns the football club, "The Hull City Association Football Club (Tigers) Ltd," is currently owned by Allamhouse Limited, a private, <a href="Limited%20liability">limited-liability</a> company with a <a href="share%20capital">share capital</a> of £10 million (), registered in <a href="Jersey">Jersey</a>.

Hull City's <a href="Bookkeeping">corporate accounts</a>, , showed a £25.6 million loss, on <a href="revenue">revenue</a>s of £11 million, after player and management costs of "just under £23 million." The club has "<a href="Deferred%20tax">future tax losses</a>" available of more than £45 million. Another Assam Allam company, Allam Marine, also wholly owned by Allamhouse Limited, revealed in its 2012 accounts that "<a href="Tax%20shelter">utilisation of tax losses</a> from <a href="Corporate%20group">group</a> companies" reduced its <a href="United%20Kingdom%20corporation%20tax">tax liability</a> by £3.8 million over 2011 and 2012.

West Ham United F.C.

West Ham United Football Club is an English professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club that plays its home matches in <a href="Stratford%2C%20London">Stratford</a>, <a href="East%20London">East London</a>. The club competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the top tier of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a>. The club plays at the <a href="London%20Stadium">London Stadium</a>, having moved from their former home, the <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Boleyn Ground</a>, in 2016.
West Ham United was founded in 1895 as <a href="Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.">Thames Ironworks</a> and reformed in 1900 as West Ham United. It moved to the Boleyn Ground, which remained its home ground for more than a century, in 1904. The team initially competed in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> and <a href="Western%20Football%20League">Western League</a> before joining the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1919. It was promoted to the top flight in 1923, when it was also losing finalist in the first <a href="1923%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> held at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. In 1940, the club won the inaugural <a href="Football%20League%20War%20Cup">Football League War Cup</a>.
West Ham United has won five major honours in its history. Domestically, it has been winner of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> three times (1964, 1975 and 1980) and runner-up twice (1923 and 2006). In European competitions, the club has reached three major European finals winning the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> in <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1965</a>, finishing runner-up in the same competitions in <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1976</a>, and winning the second edition of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League">Europa Conference League</a> in <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League">2023</a>. The club has also won one minor European trophy by winning the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a> in 1999. West Ham United is one of eight clubs never to have fallen below the second tier of English football, spending 66 of 98 league seasons in the top flight, up to and including the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20Premier%20League">2023–24 season</a>. The club's highest league position to date came in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Football%20League">1985–86</a>, when it achieved third place in the then <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>.
Three West Ham players were members of the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a> finals-winning <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> team: captain <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a> and goalscorers <a href="Geoff%20Hurst">Geoff Hurst</a> and <a href="Martin%20Peters">Martin Peters</a>.

West Ham adopted their <a href="Bordeaux%20wine">claret</a> and <a href="sky%20blue">sky blue</a> colour scheme in the early 1900s, with the most common iteration of a claret shirt and sky blue sleeves first emerging in 1904.
History.
Origins.
The earliest generally accepted incarnation of West Ham United was founded in 1895 as <a href="Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.">Thames Ironworks F.C.</a>, the <a href="works%20team">works team</a> of the largest and last surviving shipbuilder on the Thames, <a href="Thames%20Ironworks%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company">Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company</a>, by foreman and local league referee <a href="Dave%20Taylor%20%28Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.%20founder%29">Dave Taylor</a> and owner <a href="Arnold%20Hills">Arnold Hills</a> and was announced in the "Thames Ironworks Gazette" of June 1895. Thames Ironworks was based in <a href="Leamouth">Leamouth Wharf</a> in <a href="Blackwall%2C%20London">Blackwall</a> and <a href="Canning%20Town">Canning Town</a> on both banks of the <a href="River%20Lea">River Lea</a>, where the <a href="River%20Lea">Lea</a> meets the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>. Thames Ironworks built many ships and other structures, the most famous being . The last ship built there was the <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> in 1912 and the yard shut soon after.
The repair yard of the <a href="Union-Castle%20Line">Castle Shipping Line</a> was a very near neighbour and their work team, initially known as the <a href="Old%20Castle%20Swifts%20F.C.">Castle Swifts</a>, would informally merge with the Thames Ironworks own team.
The team played on a strictly amateur basis for 1895 at least, with a team featuring a number of works employees. Thomas Freeman was a ships fireman and Walter Parks, a clerk. <a href="Johnny%20Stewart%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201872%29">Johnny Stewart</a>, <a href="Walter%20Tranter">Walter Tranter</a> and <a href="Jamie%20Lindsay%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201870%29">James Lindsay</a> were all boilermakers. Other employees included William Chapman, <a href="George%20Sage%20%28footballer%29">George Sage</a> and Fred Chamberlain, as well as apprentice riveter <a href="Charlie%20Dove">Charlie Dove</a>, who was to have a great influence on the club's future at a later date.
Thames Ironworks won the <a href="West%20Ham%20Charity%20Cup">West Ham Charity Cup</a>, contested by clubs in the <a href="West%20Ham">West Ham</a> locality, in 1895, then won the <a href="London%20League%20%28football%29">London League</a> in 1897. They turned professional in 1898 upon entering the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> Second Division, and were promoted to the First Division at the first attempt. The following year they came second from bottom, but had established themselves as a fully-fledged competitive team. They comfortably fended off the challenge of local rivals <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in a relegation play-off, 5–1 in late April 1900 and retained their First Division status.
The team initially played in full dark blue kits, as inspired by Mr. Hills, who had been an Oxford University "<a href="University%20Sporting%20Blue">Blue</a>," but changed the following season by adopting the sky blue shirts and white shorts combination worn from 1897 to 1899.
Following growing disputes over the running and financing of the club, in June 1900 Thames Ironworks F.C. was disbanded, then almost immediately relaunched as West Ham United F.C. — reflecting the <a href="West%20Ham">West Ham</a>, London district where they played — on 5 July 1900 with <a href="Syd%20King">Syd King</a> as their manager and future manager <a href="Charlie%20Paynter">Charlie Paynter</a> as his assistant. Because of the original "works team" roots and links (still represented upon the club badge), they are still known as "the Irons" or "the Hammers" amongst fans and the media.
Birth of West Ham United (1901–1961).
West Ham United joined the Western League for the 1901 season while also continuing to play in the Southern Division 1. In 1907, West Ham were crowned the Western League Division 1B Champions, and then defeated 1A champions Fulham 1–0 to become the Western League Overall Champions. The reborn club continued to play their games at the <a href="Memorial%20Grounds">Memorial Grounds</a> in <a href="Plaistow%2C%20Newham">Plaistow</a> (funded by Arnold Hills) but moved to a <a href="Association%20football%20pitch">pitch</a> in the Upton Park area in the guise of the <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Boleyn Ground</a> stadium in 1904. West Ham's first game in their new home was against fierce <a href="Millwall%20F.C.%E2%80%93West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">rivals</a> <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> (themselves an Ironworks team, albeit for a rival company) drawing a crowd of 10,000 and with West Ham running out 3–0 winners, and as the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" wrote on 2 September 1904, "Favoured by the weather turning fine after heavy rains of the morning, West Ham United began their season most auspiciously yesterday evening; when they beat Millwall by 3 goals to 0 on their new enclosure at Upton Park."
In 1919, still under King's leadership, West Ham gained entrance to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a>, their first game being a 1–1 draw with <a href="Lincoln%20City%20F.C.">Lincoln City</a>, and were promoted to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1923, also making it to the first ever <a href="FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> to be held at the old <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. Their opponents were <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. This was also known as the "<a href="White%20Horse%20final">White Horse final</a>", so named because an estimated 200,000 people came to see the match; spilling out on to the pitch, which had to be cleared prior to kick-off, by "Billie," a giant white horse (actually grey) being ridden by PC <a href="George%20Scorey">George Scorey</a>. The cup final match itself ended 2–0 to Bolton. The team enjoyed mixed success in the First Division but retained their status for ten years and reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1933.
In 1932, the club was relegated to the Second Division and long-term custodian <a href="Syd%20King">Syd King</a> was sacked after serving the club in the role of manager for 32 years, and as a player from 1899 to 1903. Following relegation, King had mental health problems. He appeared drunk at a board meeting and soon after committed suicide. He was replaced with his assistant manager <a href="Charlie%20Paynter">Charlie Paynter</a>, who himself had been with West Ham in a number of roles since 1897 and who went on to serve the team in this role until 1950 for a total of 480 games. The club spent most of the next thirty years in this division, first under Paynter and then later under the leadership of former player <a href="Ted%20Fenton">Ted Fenton</a>.
Fenton succeeded in getting the club promoted back to the top level of English football in 1958. With the considerable input of player <a href="Malcolm%20Allison">Malcolm Allison</a>, Fenton helped develop both the initial batch of future West Ham stars and West Ham's approach to the game.
Glory years (1961–1986).
<a href="Ron%20Greenwood">Ron Greenwood</a> was appointed as Fenton's successor in 1961 and soon led the club to two major trophies, winning the <a href="1964%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1964 FA Cup Final</a>. The team was led by the young <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a>. West Ham also won the <a href="1965%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> the following year. During the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a>, key members of the tournament winners <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> were West Ham players, including the captain, <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a>; <a href="Martin%20Peters">Martin Peters</a> (who scored in the final); and <a href="Geoff%20Hurst">Geoff Hurst</a>, who scored the first <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> in a <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> final. All three players had come through the youth team at West Ham. 
There is a "Champions" statue in <a href="Barking%20Road">Barking Road</a>, opposite The <a href="Boleyn%20Tavern">Boleyn Tavern</a>, commemorating West Ham's "three sons" who helped win the 1966 World Cup: Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters. Also included on the statue is <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>'s <a href="Ray%20Wilson%20%28English%20footballer%29">Ray Wilson</a>.
After a difficult start to the 1974–75 season, Greenwood moved himself "upstairs" to become general manager and, without informing the board, appointed his assistant <a href="John%20Lyall">John Lyall</a> as team manager. The result was instant success – the team scored 20 goals in their first four games and won the FA Cup, becoming the last team to win the FA Cup with an all-English side when they beat Fulham 2–0 in the 1975 final. The Fulham team included two former England <a href="captain%20%28association%20football%29">captains</a>, <a href="Alan%20Mullery">Alan Mullery</a> and West Ham legend Bobby Moore. Lyall then guided West Ham to another <a href="1976%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> final in 1976, though the team lost the match 4–2 to Belgian side <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>. Greenwood's tenure as general manager lasted less than three years, as he was appointed to manage England in the wake of <a href="Don%20Revie">Don Revie</a>'s resignation in 1977.
In 1978, West Ham were again relegated to the Second Division, but Lyall was retained as manager and led the team to victory in the <a href="1980%20FA%20Cup%20final">1980 FA Cup final</a> with a 1–0 win against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, the most recent time a team from outside the top flight has won the FA Cup. They reached the final by defeating Everton in the semi-final. West Ham were promoted to the First Division in 1981, and finished in the top ten of the First Division for the next three seasons before achieving their highest-ever league finish of third in 1985–86; a group of players which came to be known as <a href="The%20Boys%20of%2086">The Boys of 86</a>.
Ups and downs (1986–2005).
However, the "Hammers" suffered relegation again in 1989, which resulted in Lyall's sacking. He was awarded an "ex gratia" payment of () but left the club in what Lyall described as "upsetting" circumstances, meriting only 73 words in a terse acknowledgement of his service in the club programme. Lyall left West Ham after 34 years' service.
After Lyall, <a href="Lou%20Macari">Lou Macari</a> briefly led the team, though he resigned after less than a single season in order to clear his name of allegations of illegal betting while manager of <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a>.
He was replaced by former player <a href="Billy%20Bonds">Billy Bonds</a>. In Bonds' first full season, <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1990–91</a>, West Ham again secured promotion to the First Division. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a <a href="Debenture%20%28sport%29">bond scheme</a>, there was crowd unrest. West Ham finished last and were relegated back to the Second Division after only one season. However, they rebounded strongly in 1992–93. With <a href="Trevor%20Morley">Trevor Morley</a> and <a href="Clive%20Allen">Clive Allen</a> scoring 40 goals, they guaranteed themselves second place on the last day of the season with a 2–0 home win against <a href="Cambridge%20United%20F.C.">Cambridge United</a>, and with it promotion to the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a>.
With the team in the Premier League, there was a need to rebuild the team. <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a> player <a href="Joey%20Beauchamp">Joey Beauchamp</a> was recruited for a fee of £1.2 million (equivalent to £ million in ). Shortly after arriving at the club, however, he became unhappy, citing homesickness from his native Oxford as the reason. Bonds in particular found this attitude hard to understand compared to his own committed, never-say-die approach; providing for Bonds' further evidence of the decay in the modern game and modern player. Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000 (equivalent to £ million in ), which included defender <a href="Adrian%20Whitbread">Adrian Whitbread</a> going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) in the deal.
Assistant manager <a href="Harry%20Redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a> was also now taking a bigger role in the transfer of players, with the club's approval. With rumours of his old club <a href="AFC%20Bournemouth">AFC Bournemouth</a> being prepared to offer him a position, the West Ham board and their managing director, <a href="Peter%20Storrie">Peter Storrie</a>, made a controversial move. The board were anxious not to lose Redknapp's services and offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and walked away from the club. His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling. Peter Storrie claimed that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, "If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so we were in a no-win situation. We're sad that Bill is going, and it's a big blow but it's time to move on and we have appointed a great manager."
Redknapp became manager on 10 August 1994.
Redknapp's seven years as manager was notable for the turnover of players during his tenure and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of £16 million, despite the £18 million sale (equivalent to £ million in ) of <a href="Rio%20Ferdinand">Rio Ferdinand</a> to <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> in 2000. Some were notably successful, such as the signings of <a href="Stuart%20Pearce">Stuart Pearce</a>, <a href="Trevor%20Sinclair">Trevor Sinclair</a>, <a href="Paolo%20Di%20Canio">Paolo Di Canio</a>, <a href="John%20Hartson">John Hartson</a>, <a href="Eyal%20Berkovic">Eyal Berkovic</a> and <a href="Ian%20Wright">Ian Wright</a>. Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as <a href="Florin%20Raducioiu">Florin Raducioiu</a>; <a href="Davor%20%C5%A0uker">Davor Šuker</a>, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances; <a href="Christian%20Bassila">Christian Bassila</a>, who cost £720,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) and played only 86 minutes of football; <a href="Titi%20Camara">Titi Camara</a>; <a href="Gary%20Charles">Gary Charles</a>, whose wages amounted to £4.4 million (equivalent to £ million in ) but made only three starts for the club; <a href="Rigobert%20Song">Rigobert Song</a>; <a href="Paulo%20Futre">Paulo Futre</a>; and <a href="Marco%20Boogers">Marco Boogers</a>, a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League. His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks, while his third season would also see another relegation battle. Always willing to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and <a href="Paul%20Kitson">Paul Kitson</a>, who added the impetus needed at the season's end.
In 1999, West Ham finished fifth, their highest position in the top flight since 1986. They also won the <a href="Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a> beating French club <a href="FC%20Metz">Metz</a> to qualify for the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Cup">1999–2000 UEFA Cup</a>. Things began to falter for Redknapp with the sale of Ferdinand to Leeds in November 2000. Redknapp used the transfer money poorly with purchases such as <a href="Ragnvald%20Soma">Ragnvald Soma</a>, who cost £800,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) and played only seven league games, Camara, and Song. Redknapp felt he needed more funds with which to deal in the transfer market. Chairman <a href="Terry%20Brown%20%28football%20chairman%29">Brown</a> lost patience with Redknapp due to his demands for further transfer funds. In June 2001, called to a meeting with Brown expecting to discuss contracts, he was fired. His assistant <a href="Frank%20Lampard%20Sr.">Frank Lampard</a> left too, making the sale of his son, <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard Jr.</a>, inevitable; in the summer of 2001, he joined <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> for £11 million (equivalent to £ million in ).
With several names, such as former player <a href="Alan%20Curbishley">Alan Curbishley</a>, now linked with the job, Chairman Brown recruited from within the club, appointing reserve team coach <a href="Glenn%20Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a> as manager on 9 May 2001. He had already failed in management with <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a>, where he lost 22 of the 35 games he managed, and <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>. His first big signings were the return of <a href="Don%20Hutchison">Don Hutchison</a> for £5 million (equivalent to £ million in ) and Czech centre back <a href="Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20%C5%98epka">Tomáš Řepka</a>. Finishing seventh in his first season Roeder, in his office at <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Upton Park</a>, suffered a blocked blood vessel in his brain. As Roeder needed medical help and recuperation, former stalwart <a href="Trevor%20Brooking">Trevor Brooking</a> stood in as caretaker manager. Despite not losing another game, the Hammers were relegated on the last day of the season at <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>, with a record high for a relegated club of 42 points from a 38-game season. Ten seasons of top-tier football were over. Many top players, including <a href="Joe%20Cole">Joe Cole</a>, Di Canio and Kanouté, all left the club.
The next season, now in the second tier, Roeder resumed his stint as manager. Results were still poor, however, and after an away defeat to <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a>, he was sacked on 24 August 2003. Brooking again took over as caretaker. He lost only one game, a 2–0 away defeat to <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> and is known as "the best manager West Ham never had."
Former <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> player and manager of <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> <a href="Alan%20Pardew">Alan Pardew</a> was lined up to be the next bench boss. Reading and their chairman, <a href="John%20Madejski">John Madejski</a>, however, were reluctant to let him leave. After serving a period of notice and gardening leave, and with West Ham paying Reading £380,000 () in compensation, he was appointed manager on 18 October 2003, their tenth manager. Pardew set out to rebuild the side bringing in <a href="Nigel%20Reo-Coker">Nigel Reo-Coker</a>, <a href="Marlon%20Harewood">Marlon Harewood</a> and <a href="Brian%20Deane">Brian Deane</a>. In his first season in charge, they made the playoff final only to lose to Crystal Palace. His signings of <a href="Bobby%20Zamora">Bobby Zamora</a>, <a href="Matthew%20Etherington">Matthew Etherington</a> and veterans <a href="Chris%20Powell">Chris Powell</a> and <a href="Teddy%20Sheringham">Teddy Sheringham</a> saw West Ham finishing sixth and subsequently beat <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> 1–0 thanks to a Zamora goal in the <a href="2005%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">2005 playoff final</a>, securing a return to the Premier League. After ensuring promotion, Pardew said, "It's a team effort. We defended well and we're back where we belong."
Final years at the Boleyn (2005–2016).
On their return to the top division, West Ham finished in ninth place,<ref name="Final 2005/2006 English Premier Table"></ref> The highlight of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20season">2005–06 season</a>, however, was reaching the <a href="2006%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> and taking favourites <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> to a <a href="penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootout</a> after a 3–3 draw. West Ham lost the shootout, but nonetheless gained entry to the following season's <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> as Liverpool had already qualified for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>. In August 2006, West Ham completed a major coup on the last day of the transfer window after completing the signings of <a href="Carlos%20Tevez">Carlos Tevez</a> and <a href="Javier%20Mascherano">Javier Mascherano</a>. The club was eventually bought by an <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>ic consortium, led by <a href="Eggert%20Magn%C3%BAsson">Eggert Magnússon</a>, in November 2006. Manager Alan Pardew was sacked after poor form during the season and was replaced by former <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> manager <a href="Alan%20Curbishley">Alan Curbishley</a>.
The signings of Mascherano and Tevez were investigated by the Premier League, who were concerned that details of the transfers had been omitted from official records. The club was found guilty and fined £5.5 million in April 2007. However, West Ham avoided a points deduction which ultimately became critical in their avoidance of relegation at the end of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Premier%20League">2006–07 season</a>. Following on from this event, <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> chairman <a href="Dave%20Whelan">Dave Whelan</a>, supported by other sides facing possible relegation, including Fulham and <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, threatened legal action. West Ham escaped relegation by winning seven of their last nine games, including a 1–0 win over Arsenal, and on the last day of the season defeated newly crowned League Champions <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> 1–0 with a goal by Tevez to finish 15th.
In the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08 season</a>, West Ham remained reasonably consistently in the top half of the league table, with <a href="Freddie%20Ljungberg">Freddie Ljungberg</a> in the team, despite a slew of injuries; new signing <a href="Craig%20Bellamy">Craig Bellamy</a> missed most of the campaign, while <a href="Kieron%20Dyer">Kieron Dyer</a> was out from August 2007. The last game of the season, at the <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Boleyn Ground</a>, saw West Ham draw 2–2 against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, ensuring a tenth-place finish three points ahead of rivals <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. It was a five-place improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation.
After a row with the board over the sale of defenders <a href="Anton%20Ferdinand">Anton Ferdinand</a> and <a href="George%20McCartney%20%28footballer%29">George McCartney</a> to <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, manager Alan Curbishley resigned on 3 September 2008. His successor was former Chelsea striker <a href="Gianfranco%20Zola">Gianfranco Zola</a>, who took over on 11 September 2008 to become the club's first non-British manager. In the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09 season</a>, West Ham finished ninth, a single place improvement.
In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10 season</a>, West Ham started strongly with a 2–0 win over newly promoted <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>, with goals from <a href="Mark%20Noble">Mark Noble</a> and newly appointed captain <a href="Matthew%20Upson">Matthew Upson</a>. A <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> <a href="2009%20Upton%20Park%20riot">match</a> against old rivals <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> brought about violent riots outside the ground as well as <a href="pitch%20invasion">pitch invasion</a>s and crowd trouble inside <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Upton Park</a>.
In August 2009, the financial concerns of Icelandic owners parent companies left the current owners unable to provide any funds until a new owner was found. The club's shirt sponsor <a href="SBOBET">SBOBET</a> provided the club with help to purchase a much needed striker, the Italian <a href="Alessandro%20Diamanti">Alessandro Diamanti</a>.
West Ham had a poor season which involved a prolonged battle against relegation. They finally secured their survival with two games remaining by defeating Wigan 3–2. The club managed to take 35 points from 38 games, seven fewer than the total they had when relegated seven years prior.
On 11 May 2010, two days after the end of the 2009–10 season, West Ham announced the termination of Zola's contract with immediate effect. On 3 June 2010, <a href="Avram%20Grant">Avram Grant</a> signed a four-year deal to become the next manager of West Ham subject to a <a href="Work%20permit%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">work permit</a>. West Ham's form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone, placing Grant's future as manager under serious doubt. A 4–0 <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> quarter-final win over Manchester United was an otherwise bright spot in a disappointing season. West Ham's form in the Premier League did not affect their form in the two domestic cups. The Hammers reached the semi-final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> as well as the quarter-final of the FA Cup before a 2–1 defeat at eventual runners-up <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a>.
On 15 May 2011, West Ham's relegation to <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League%20Championship">the Championship</a> was confirmed after a comeback from Wigan at the <a href="DW%20Stadium">DW Stadium</a>. With West Ham leading 2–0 at half-time through two <a href="Demba%20Ba">Demba Ba</a> goals, Wigan battled back to win 3–2 thanks to an added-time strike from <a href="Charles%20N%27Zogbia">Charles N'Zogbia</a>. Following the loss, West Ham announced the <a href="Dismissal%20%28employment%29">sacking</a> of manager Avram Grant just one season into his tenure. On 1 June 2011, <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> was appointed as manager as Grant's replacement.
The club finished third in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League%20Championship">2011–12 Football League Championship</a> with 86 points and took part in the play-offs. They beat <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> in the play-off semi-final 5–0 on aggregate to reach the final against <a href="Blackpool%20F.C">Blackpool</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a> on 19 May 2012. <a href="Carlton%20Cole">Carlton Cole</a> opened the scoring, and although Blackpool equalised early in the second half, <a href="Ricardo%20Vaz%20T%C3%AA">Ricardo Vaz Tê</a> scored the winner for West Ham in the 87th minute.
West Ham, on their return to the Premier League, signed former players <a href="James%20Collins%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29">James Collins</a> and <a href="George%20McCartney%20%28footballer%29">George McCartney</a> on permanent deals, as well as record signing <a href="Matt%20Jarvis">Matt Jarvis</a> and <a href="Andy%20Carroll">Andy Carroll</a> on loan. They won their first game of the season, on 18 August 2012, 1–0 against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> thanks to a <a href="Kevin%20Nolan">Kevin Nolan</a> goal. The highlight of the first half of the season was a 3–1 home win against reigning <a href="2012%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">European champions</a> <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> on 1 December 2012 which saw them in eighth position and 12th at the end of the year. On 22 March 2013, West Ham secured a 99-year lease deal on the <a href="London%20Stadium">Olympic Stadium</a>, with it planned to be used as their home ground from the 2016–17 season. Tenth place was secured at the end of the season with nine home wins and only three away from home. Only 11 away goals were scored, the lowest of the entire league.
In <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a>, West Ham finished 13th in the Premier League. They also reached the semi-finals of the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> before losing 9–0 on aggregate to eventual cup-winners <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. A feature of the season were the criticisms of manager Sam Allardyce by supporters relating to his perceived negative playing tactics. West Ham finished 12th in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Premier%20League">2014–15 Premier League</a>, one place higher than the previous season. Minutes after the last game of the season, on 24 May 2015, the club announced that Allardyce's contract would not be renewed and that they were seeking a new manager. By winning the Premier League <a href="Fair%20Play%20league">Fair Play table</a> for 2014–15, West Ham qualified for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2015–16 UEFA Europa League</a>, entering at the first qualifying round.
On 9 June 2015, former West Ham player <a href="Slaven%20Bili%C4%87">Slaven Bilić</a> was appointed as manager on a three-year contract. In Bilić's fourth game in charge, the team won at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> for the first time in 52 years, beating Liverpool 0–3, with goals from <a href="Manuel%20Lanzini">Manuel Lanzini</a>, Mark Noble and <a href="Diafra%20Sakho">Diafra Sakho</a>. At the end of the season, West Ham finished 7th in the Premier League. The team broke several records for the club in the Premier League era, including the highest number of points (62), the highest number of goals in a season (65), the fewest games lost in a season (8) and the lowest number of away defeats (5). The season also marked the last season where the team played at the Boleyn Ground, with them moving to the London Stadium from next season - ending their 112-year stay at the stadium.
Move to London Stadium and European success (2016–).
Following Manchester United's win in the <a href="2016%20FA%20Cup%20final">2016 FA Cup final</a>, West Ham took their Europa League place and qualified for the third qualifying round of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2016–17 edition</a>. At the end of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League">first season at the London Stadium</a>, the team finished 11th, along with having to deal with the departure of star man <a href="Dimitri%20Payet">Dimitri Payet</a>. However, the team suffered a poor start to the following season, taking only two wins in their opening 11 games. Following a 4–1 defeat to Liverpool at home and with the team threatened by relegation, Bilić was sacked on 6 November 2017. He was replaced by former Sunderland boss <a href="David%20Moyes">David Moyes</a> on a contract until the end of the season. The team battled inconsistent form for the rest of the season but managed to avoid relegation and finish 13th. Moyes was not offered a new contract and left the club on the expiration of it on 16 May 2018.
On 22 May 2018, the club appointed former <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> boss <a href="Manuel%20Pellegrini">Manuel Pellegrini</a> as the new manager on a three-year deal contract. In his first season in charge, the Hammers finished 10th, once again suffering from inconsistent form. However, after a poor first half to the following season, Pellegrini was sacked in December 2019 with the team only one point above the relegation zone. His last game in charge was a 2–1 home loss to Leicester City. He was replaced by David Moyes, who returned for a second spell in charge a day later.
On 22 July 2020, the club secured their Premier League status for another season, following a 1–1 draw away to Manchester United. Ahead of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20season">2020–21 season</a>, West Ham's ownership attracted criticism, including from club captain Mark Noble who publicly criticized the sale of academy graduate <a href="Grady%20Diangana">Grady Diangana</a>. Despite losing the opening two games of the season, West Ham's form improved and by the end of November, the club sat in fifth place. The club would not drop out of a European spot for the rest of the season and went on to qualify for the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2021–22 UEFA Europa League</a> group stages after finishing in 6th. Moyes signed a new three-year contract on 12 June 2021.
West Ham won their first three games of the year 2022, temporarily elevating the club to fourth place in the Premier League. The team beat <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> 2–1 on aggregate to reach a first European quarter-final in 41 years, followed by a 4–1 aggregate win over <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a> for a first such semi-final since 1976. Playing the same opposition they met in their 1976 <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> semi-final, <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>, the "Hammers" were knocked out of the Europa League, following a 3–1 aggregate loss to the German side. At the end of the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Premier%20League">2021–22 Premier League</a> season, West Ham confirmed a second successive season of European football, qualifying for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League">UEFA Europa Conference League</a> after finishing seventh. The season was also notable for being Mark Noble's final as a West Ham player, with the midfielder retiring from football after 18 years as a first team player at the club, making 550 appearances in all competitions, scoring 62 times. By finishing 7th in the 2021–22 Premier League, West Ham qualified for the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League">2022–23 Europa Conference League</a>, entering at the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League%20qualifying%20phase%20and%20play-off%20round%23Play-off%20round">play-off stage</a>.
The <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 campaign</a> was a mixed bag for the "Hammers". The club finished 14th in the Premier League, only securing their Premier League status with two games remaining and exiting the League Cup to lower league opposition in a season that saw manager David Moyes come under pressure. In January 2023, Mark Noble returned to the club as sporting director. Despite the troubles in West Ham's domestic campaign, they excelled in the Europa Conference League. The club progressed to the <a href="2023%20UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League%20final">final</a> unbeaten, winning 13 games and drawing just once. They went on to win the competition, defeating <a href="ACF%20Fiorentina">Fiorentina</a> 2–1 in the final to claim their first major trophy since 1980 and their first European trophy in 58 years.
Crest.
Thames Ironworks FC.
The Thames Ironworks Team (1895–1900) used the <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a> as its badge.
Rivet Hammers.
The principal element of the badge is the crossed pair of rivet hammers, tools that were used in the shipbuilding industry. The <a href="Blackwall%2C%20London">Blackwall</a> and <a href="Canning%20Town">Canning Town</a> neighbourhoods surrounding the <a href="Thames%20Ironworks%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company">Thames Ironworks</a> echoed to the sound of hammers; <a href="steam%20hammer">steam hammer</a>s, sledge hammers and rivet hammers.
Seven large mechanical steam hammers would punch small holes near the edges of the iron plates which would be joined to build the ships. The plates would be put in place and fixed together with rivets by teams of five, three inside the emerging vessel and two outside.
Inside the ship one member of the team would heat the rivets till they were white hot and, using "Iron Fingers" (<a href="blacksmith">blacksmith's</a> <a href="tongs">tongs</a>), throw them to a second person, known as a "catch-boy" or "putter-in", who would pick the rivet up and place it the hole, also using tongs. The third person was known as the "holder-on" and he would then smash the rivet home with a sixteen-pound sledgehammer and then use his sledgehammer to hold the rivet in place while the men on the other side flattened the other end of the rivet.
Outside the ship, exposed to the elements, two men with rivet hammers – one right-handed, one left-handed – would hammer the protruding and still glowing rivet flat, so securing one of the many points necessary to link each of the ship's large plates.
The crossed hammers were also incorporated into the coat of arms of the <a href="County%20Borough%20of%20West%20Ham">County Borough of West Ham</a> and those of its successor, the modern <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Newham">London Borough of Newham</a>. The Thames Ironworks lay partly within what is now the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. However, the blacksmith's tongs in <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Tower%20Hamlets%23Coat%20of%20arms">that Borough's coat of arms</a> represent the local saint, <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a>, the patron saint of <a href="Stepney">Stepney</a> and metalworkers, rather than the Ironworks.
Tower.
A yellow or white tower was added, intermittently, from the 1950s onwards. The primary reason for this seems to be to represent "Anne Boleyn's Tower", the most notable feature of <a href="Green%20Street%20House">Green Street House</a>, an originally Tudor group of buildings which stood next to the <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Boleyn Ground</a> until demolished in 1955. <a href="Green%20Street%20House">Green Street House</a> was also known as "Boleyn Castle" through an association with <a href="Anne%20Boleyn">Anne Boleyn</a>. The manor was reputedly one of the sites at which <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a> courted his second queen, though there is no documentary evidence to support the tradition.
There are a number of other factors which may have influenced the inclusion of the stylised castle feature, for instance:
Shield.
A shield has been used in many iterations of the club badge, and the shape of the 2016 version matches the cross-section on the hull of <a href="HMS%20Warrior%20%281860%29">HMS Warrior</a>, the most famous ship built by the Thames Ironworks. However examining draughtsman's diagrams of the ship casts doubt on the resemblance between the shield and the ship.
Iterations.
The crest was redesigned and updated in the late 1990s, featuring a wider yellow castle with fewer cruciform "windows" along with the peaked roofs being removed; the tops of the towers had previously made the castle appear more akin to <a href="Disneyland%20Park%20%28Anaheim%29">Disneyland</a>'s Sleeping Beauty's Castle than a functioning fortress. The designer also altered other details to give a more substantial feel to the iconography.
When the club rebuilt the west stand of the <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Boleyn Ground</a> (construction finished 2001–02) the "castle" from the redesigned badge was incorporated into the structure at the main entrance to the ground. A pair of towers were prominent features of the ground's appearance, both bearing large club badges.
A new badge was introduced following the end of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 season</a>, when the club moved into the <a href="London%20Stadium">Olympic Stadium</a>. It removes the Boleyn Castle due to the club moving away, leaving just the crossed hammers, which the club says is inspired by the crest before and during the career of <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a>. The word "London" was introduced below to "establish the club firmly on the international stage", and the more minimalist approach is to give a "strong statement that is instantly West Ham United". The shape of the crest is that of the <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> of , the first <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad warship</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, which was built by <a href="Thames%20Ironworks%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company">Thames Ironworks</a>.
Colours.
The original colours of the team were dark blue, due to <a href="Thames%20Ironworks%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company">Thames Ironworks</a> chairman <a href="Arnold%20Hills">Arnold Hills</a> being a former student of Oxford University (see <a href="Oxford%20Blue%20%28colour%29">Oxford blue</a>). However, the team used a variety of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks, as well as sky blue or white kit.
The Irons permanently adopted claret and blue for home colours in 1903.
One story suggests that <a href="Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.">Thames Ironworks</a> right-half <a href="Charlie%20Dove">Charlie Dove</a> received the <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> kit from William Belton, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Belton had been at a fair in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, close to <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a>, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win. Belton defeated them and, when they were unable to pay the bet, one of the Villa players who was responsible for washing the team's kit offered a complete team's "football kits" to Belton in payment. The Aston Villa player subsequently reported to his club that the kit was "missing." This, however, is often disputed.
Thames Ironworks, and later West Ham United, retained the claret yoke/blue sleeves design, but also continued to use their previously favoured colours for their away kits.
Supporters, hooliganism and rivalries.
Supporters.
The team's supporters are famous for their rendition of the chorus of their team's anthem, "<a href="I%27m%20Forever%20Blowing%20Bubbles">I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles</a>" introduced to the club by former manager Charlie Paynter in the late 1920s. A <a href="Pears%20soap">Pears soap</a> commercial featuring the curly haired child in the <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">Millais</a>' "<a href="Bubbles%20%28painting%29">Bubbles</a>" was well known at the time. The child resembled a player, Billy J. "Bubbles" Murray, from local schoolboy team, Park School, where the headmaster was Cornelius Beal. Beal was known locally for his music and rhyme and wrote special words to the tune of "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" whenever any player was having a good game.
Beal was a friend of Paynter, while Murray was a West Ham trialist and played football at schoolboy level with a number of West Ham players such as <a href="Jim%20Barrett%20Sr.">Jim Barrett</a>. Through this contrivance of association the club's fans took it upon themselves to begin singing the popular music hall tune before home games, sometimes reinforced by the presence of a house band requested to play the refrain by Charlie Paynter.
The <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final%201975">1975 FA Cup</a> version – which contains the original lyrics, and features vocals from the team's then-current players – is always played before home games, with the home crowd joining in and carrying the song on after the music stops at the verse line "Fortune's always hiding". Bubbles was published as a waltz whereas during the game the crowd sing it in <a href="common%20time">common time</a>.
Since the 1950s, fans have also sung the <a href="East%20London">East London</a> <a href="pub%20song">pub song</a> <a href="Knees%20Up%20Mother%20Brown">Knees Up Mother Brown</a>. The song title is also the name of an <a href="internet%20forum">internet forum</a> related to the club.
Like other teams, the team also have a history of adopting or adapting popular songs of the day to fit particular events, themes, players or personas. These have included serious renditions of theatre and movie classics such as "<a href="Me%20And%20My%20Girl">The Bells are Ringing</a>," along with more <a href="pun">pun</a>-laden or humorous efforts, such as chanting former player <a href="Paolo%20Di%20Canio">Paolo Di Canio</a>'s name to the <a href="canzone">canzone</a> "<a href="La%20donna%20%C3%A8%20mobile">La donna è mobile</a>" by <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>, or D.I. Canio to the tune of <a href="Ottawan">Ottawan</a>'s "<a href="D.I.S.C.O.">D.I.S.C.O.</a>", or the chant of "Who Let The Potts Out?" to the tune of <a href="Baha%20Men">Baha Men</a>'s "<a href="Who%20Let%20the%20Dogs%20Out%3F">Who Let the Dogs Out?</a>" when <a href="Steve%20Potts%20%28footballer%29">Steve Potts</a> could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career, or "That's Zamora" to the tune of <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a>'s 1953 "<a href="That%27s%20Amore">That's Amore</a>" in honour of former striker <a href="Bobby%20Zamora">Bobby Zamora</a>. Other former players to be serenaded include <a href="Christian%20Dailly">Christian Dailly</a> with vastly-altered lyrics to <a href="Frankie%20Valli">Frankie Valli</a>'s "<a href="Can%27t%20Take%20My%20Eyes%20Off%20You">Can't Take My Eyes Off You</a>", <a href="Joe%20Cole">Joe Cole</a> and <a href="Carlton%20Cole">Carlton Cole</a> with <a href="Spandau%20Ballet">Spandau Ballet</a>'s "<a href="Gold%20%28Spandau%20Ballet%20song%29">Gold</a>" song title sung as "Cole" and <a href="Lud%C4%9Bk%20Miklo%C5%A1ko">Luděk Mikloško</a>. A song for West Ham favourite <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a>, "Viva Bobby Moore", is also sung based on <a href="The%20Business%20%28band%29">The Business</a>'s "<a href="Oi%21">Oi!</a>" rendition of the song, based on <a href="The%20Equals">The Equals</a>' 1969 release "Viva Bobby Joe". In 2016, supporters adapted the lyrics of <a href="Billy%20Ray%20Cyrus">Billy Ray Cyrus</a>' "<a href="Achy%20Breaky%20Heart">Achy Breaky Heart</a>" in honour of <a href="Dimitri%20Payet">Dimitri Payet</a>.
When the players come onto the pitch, and at other times of celebration, as the song "I'm forever blowing bubbles" is being sung, around 60 bubble machines produce copious bubbles that rise high into the stadium.
Fans gained national attention after giving a torrid time to <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a> in his first away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on <a href="Diego%20Simeone">Diego Simeone</a>. Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in <a href="South%20East%20%28London%20sub%20region%29">South-East London</a>, the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.
They have also displayed a particular zeal when it comes to abusing former players, particularly those who are perceived to have abandoned the club or performed some disservice. <a href="Paul%20Ince">Paul Ince</a>, <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard</a>, <a href="Jermain%20Defoe">Jermain Defoe</a>, <a href="Nigel%20Reo-Coker">Nigel Reo-Coker</a> and <a href="Jesse%20Lingard">Jesse Lingard</a> have famously borne the brunt of verbal assaults and a guaranteed hostile reception at Upton Park. However, players such as Joe Cole, <a href="Michael%20Carrick">Michael Carrick</a>, <a href="Rio%20Ferdinand">Rio Ferdinand</a>, Bobby Zamora and <a href="Carlos%20Tevez">Carlos Tevez</a> receive applause and even standing ovations in honour of their contributions during their time at the club. Joe Cole subsequently rejoined West Ham from Liverpool midway through the 2012–13 season.
Hooliganism.
The origins of West Ham's links with <a href="Football%20hooliganism">hooliganism</a> starts in the 1960s with the establishment of The <a href="Mile%20End">Mile End</a> Mob (named after an area of the East End of London). During the 1970s and 1980s (the main era for organised football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for the levels of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival fans, and the police. During the 1970s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of <a href="Barking%2C%20London">Barking</a> and <a href="Dagenham">Dagenham</a>.
The <a href="Inter%20City%20Firm">Inter City Firm</a> were one of the first "<a href="Casual%20%28subculture%29">casuals</a>", so called because they avoided police supervision by not wearing football-related clothing and travelled to away matches on regular <a href="InterCity%20%28British%20Rail%29">InterCity</a> trains, rather than on the cheap and more tightly policed "football special" charter trains. The group were an infamous West Ham-aligned gang. As the firm's moniker "inter city" suggests violent activities were not confined to local derbies – the hooligans were content to cause trouble at any game, though nearby teams often bore the brunt.
Both the 1989 film "<a href="The%20Firm%20%281989%20film%29">The Firm</a>" (starring <a href="Gary%20Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>), and the 2005 film "<a href="Green%20Street%20%28film%29">Green Street</a>" (starring <a href="Elijah%20Wood">Elijah Wood</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Hunnam">Charlie Hunnam</a>) are based upon West Ham hooligan firms.
Rivalries.
West Ham have strong rivalries with several other clubs. Most of these are with other London clubs, especially with <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> in an East versus North London derby and with <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in an East versus West London rivalry. The rivalry between West Ham and Tottenham has been fuelled by players such as <a href="Michael%20Carrick">Michael Carrick</a>, <a href="Martin%20Peters">Martin Peters</a>, <a href="Paul%20Allen%20%28footballer%29">Paul Allen</a>, <a href="Jermain%20Defoe">Jermain Defoe</a> and <a href="Scott%20Parker">Scott Parker</a> leaving the Hammers to join Tottenham. The rivalry deepened with the appointment of former Hammers manager <a href="Harry%20Redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a> as Tottenham's manager. Since the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20FA%20Premier%20League">2006–07 Premier League season</a>, West Ham have developed a strong rivalry with <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> club <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> due to the dubious circumstances surrounding the transfer of <a href="Carlos%20Tevez">Carlos Tevez</a>, who helped West Ham avoid relegation at Sheffield United's expense.
The oldest and fiercest <a href="Millwall%20F.C.%E2%80%93West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">rivalry</a> is with <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>. The two sides are local rivals, having both been founded by employees of local companies, with players living in the same localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which <a href="Isle%20of%20Dogs">Isle of Dogs</a>-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans.
The rivalry between West Ham and Millwall has involved considerable violence and is one of the most notorious within the world of <a href="football%20hooliganism">football hooliganism</a>. The teams were drawn against each other in the second round of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League%20Cup">2009–10 League Cup</a> and met on 25 August 2009 at Upton Park. This was the first time in four years that the two clubs had played each other, and the first ever in the League Cup. <a href="2009%20Upton%20Park%20riots">Clashes</a> between fans occurred outside the ground, resulting in violence erupting up to half a mile away from the stadium, with serious injuries, including the stabbing of a Millwall supporter, damage to property and several arrests reported by police. There were also several pitch invasions by West Ham supporters which brought a temporary halt to the game. In January 2010, West Ham were fined after being found guilty of violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour and of failing to prevent their fans entering the field of play. Millwall were cleared of all charges.
Nicknames.
The team and supporters are known as The Hammers, in part because of the club's origins as Thames Ironworks. They are also known as The Irons.
Stadium.
Until 2016, West Ham were based at the <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Boleyn Ground</a>, commonly known as Upton Park, in <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Newham">Newham</a>, East London. The capacity of the Boleyn Ground was 35,016, and had been West Ham's ground since 1904. Prior to this, in their previous incarnation of <a href="Thames%20Ironworks%20F.C.">Thames Ironworks</a>, they played at <a href="Hermit%20Road">Hermit Road</a> in <a href="Canning%20Town">Canning Town</a> and briefly at <a href="Browning%20Road">Browning Road</a> in <a href="East%20Ham">East Ham</a>, before moving to the <a href="Memorial%20Grounds">Memorial Grounds</a> in <a href="Plaistow%2C%20Newham">Plaistow</a> in 1897. They retained the stadium during their transition to becoming West Ham United and were there for a further four seasons before moving to the Boleyn Ground in 1904.
Former chairman <a href="Eggert%20Magn%C3%BAsson">Eggert Magnússon</a> made clear his ambition for West Ham to move to the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28London%29">Olympic Stadium</a> after the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>, a desire reiterated by current chairmen Gold and Sullivan when they assumed control of the club stating that they felt it was a logical move for the government as it was in the borough of Newham.
In February 2010, however, the British Olympic Minister stated that West Ham would not get the stadium, and it would instead be used for track and field. On 17 May 2010, West Ham and <a href="Newham%20London%20Borough%20Council">Newham London Borough Council</a> submitted a formal plan to the Olympic Park Legacy Company for the use of the Olympic Stadium following the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. The proposal was for a stadium with a capacity of 60,000 which would retain a competition athletics track. The proposal was welcomed by the chairman of UK athletics, Ed Warner, who said, "I think it will feel great as a football stadium and I speak as a football fan as well the chairman of UK Athletics. I think you'd find West Ham would cover the track in the winter season so it wouldn't look like you had a track between you and the pitch."
On 30 September 2010, the club formally submitted its bid for the Olympic Stadium with a presentation at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>, and on 8 October 2010 the world's largest live entertainment company, <a href="Live%20Nation">Live Nation</a>, endorsed the club's Olympic Stadium plans. Three days after Live Nation's backing, <a href="UK%20Athletics">UK Athletics</a> confirmed its formal support for West Ham United and Newham Council in their joint bid to take over the Olympic Stadium in legacy mode. In November 2010, West Ham began a search for potential developers for "informal discussions" about what would happen to the ground if it were to win its bid to take over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. According to the club, the site could be vacated and open to redevelopment by summer 2014. On 11 February 2011, the Olympic Park Legacy Committee selected West Ham as the preferred club to move into the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games.
The decision in favour of West Ham's bid was unanimous, although controversial as local Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue. Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a>, with Leyton Orienta perennial (since 1980) <a href="EFL%20League%20One">tier 3</a> to <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">tier 5</a> clubfearful that having West Ham playing less than a mile away from their <a href="Brisbane%20Road">Brisbane Road ground</a> could steal support from the club and put them out of business. Both clubs' appeals for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011. On 3 March 2011, West Ham's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and then-<a href="Mayor%20of%20London">Mayor of London</a> <a href="Boris%20Johnson">Boris Johnson</a>.
On 8 June 2011, it was confirmed that the <a href="Westfield%20Stratford%20City">Westfield Shopping Centre</a> had been in detailed talks with West Ham for naming rights of the new Olympic stadium which could be called the Westfield Stadium. West Ham announced plans to move from the Boleyn Ground from the 2014–15 season. In August 2011, an independent investigation initiated by the Olympic Park Legacy Company upheld the decision to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games. On 29 June 2011, however, Tottenham announced that they were returning to the High Court again to fight the decision to award West Ham the stadium, in an oral hearing, to try to overturn the original High Court appeal being rejected. On 25 August 2011, Tottenham and Leyton Orient were in fact granted a judicial review by the High Court into the Olympic Stadium bidding process. On 11 October 2011, the deal to award West Ham the Olympic Stadium collapsed over concerns of legal pressure, with the government deciding that the stadium will stay in public ownership. Six days later, Tottenham and Leyton Orient announced they had ended their legal challenge after the deal collapsed.
Once the original deal collapsed, a new process to select a tenant was begun. West Ham immediately announced plans to become tenants of the stadium. By March 2012, West Ham was one of the four bidders for the stadium. With a decision due by the Olympic Park Legacy Company in May 2012, Mayor of London Boris Johnson delayed the final selection of future tenants until completion of the 2012 Summer Olympics, stating that it was "overwhelmingly likely" that the tenants would be West Ham.
It was announced on 22 March 2013 that West Ham had signed a 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra £1 million towards the costs of converting the site. The club's plan was to move into the stadium prior to the start of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20in%20English%20football">2016–17 season</a>. Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham's tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given an unfair advantage by the arrangement. In September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.
The Academy of Football.
The club promotes the popular idea of West Ham being "<a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20Under-21s%20and%20Academy">The Academy of Football</a>", with the moniker adorning the ground's new stadium façade. The comment predominantly refers to the club's youth development system which was established by manager <a href="Ted%20Fenton">Ted Fenton</a> during the 1950s, that has seen a number of international players emerge through the ranks. Most notably, the club contributed three players to the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup-winning</a> <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> side of 1966, including club icon <a href="Bobby%20Moore">Bobby Moore</a>, as well as <a href="Martin%20Peters">Martin Peters</a> and <a href="Geoff%20Hurst">Geoff Hurst</a> who between them scored all of England's goals in the eventual 4–2 victory. Other academy players that have gone on to play for England have included <a href="Trevor%20Brooking">Trevor Brooking</a>, <a href="Alvin%20Martin">Alvin Martin</a>, <a href="Tony%20Cottee">Tony Cottee</a>, <a href="Paul%20Ince">Paul Ince</a>, and <a href="Declan%20Rice">Declan Rice</a>.
Since the late 1990s, <a href="Rio%20Ferdinand">Rio Ferdinand</a>, <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard</a>, <a href="Joe%20Cole">Joe Cole</a>, <a href="Michael%20Carrick">Michael Carrick</a> and <a href="Glen%20Johnson%20%28English%20footballer%29">Glen Johnson</a> began their careers at West Ham and all went on to play for other clubs. Most recently, the likes of first teamers <a href="Mark%20Noble">Mark Noble</a> and <a href="James%20Tomkins%20%28footballer%29">James Tomkins</a>, as well as Welsh international <a href="Jack%20Collison">Jack Collison</a>, have emerged through the . Frustratingly for fans and managers alike, the club has struggled to retain many of these players due to (predominantly) financial reasons. West Ham, during the 2007–08 season, had an average of 6.61 English players in the starting line up, higher than any other Premier League club, which cemented their status as one of the few Premier League clubs left that were recognised to be bringing through young English talent and were recognised as having "homegrown players." Between 2000 and 2011, the club produced eight England players, as many as Manchester United and one fewer than Arsenal. Much of the success of the academy has been attributed to <a href="Tony%20Carr">Tony Carr</a>, who was West Ham youth coach between 1973 and 2014.
Former players.
West Ham dream team.
In the 2003 book "The Official West Ham United Dream Team", 500 fans were quizzed for who would be in their all time Hammers Eleven. The voting was restricted to players from the modern era.
Hammer of the Year.
The following is a list of recipients of the 'Hammer of the Year' award. The first award, to Andy Malcolm in <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20season">1957–58</a>, was nominated by a journalist at "The Stratford Express". Subsequent recipients would be awarded the title after a vote by supporters. Trevor Brooking was the first player for West Ham United to have been honoured with the title of Hammer of the Year three times in a row in 1976, 1977 and 1978. Scott Parker repeated this feat between 2009 and 2011. Brooking has won the award the most times, on five occasions: 1972, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1984. Bobby Moore, Billy Bonds and Julian Dicks have each won it four times.
Bobby Moore has been runner-up four times, while Billy Bonds and Tony Cottee have both been runners-up three times.
Billy Bonds and Trevor Brooking's wins are notable in the amount of time between first and last Hammer of the Year award. Bonds has 16 years separating his wins whilst Brooking has 12.
Lifetime Achievement Award.
In 2013, West Ham United introduced a new annual award, the West Ham United Lifetime Achievement Award.
The first award was presented to club-record appearance maker <a href="Billy%20Bonds">Billy Bonds</a>, who picked up the award on the pitch at Upton Park before kick-off against <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> on the opening day of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20season">2013–14 season</a>.
The 2014 award was presented to Sir <a href="Trevor%20Brooking">Trevor Brooking</a>, a record five-time winner of the Hammer of the Year award. Brooking received the award before the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a> curtain-raiser against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 August 2014. Brooking had already had the Centenary Stand at the Boleyn ground named after him in 2009.
The 2015 award was awarded to <a href="Martin%20Peters">Martin Peters</a>.
On 3 May 2016, it was announced via the club's official website that the fourth recipient of the award would be Sir <a href="Geoff%20Hurst">Geoff Hurst</a>, the club's second all-time leading goalscorer, and scorer of a hat-trick in the 1966 <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> Final. Hurst would be honoured at the club's 2015/16 Player Awards Ceremony. <a href="Ken%20Brown%20%28footballer%29">Ken Brown</a> became the sixth recipient of the award, in April 2018. The 2019 honour was awarded to <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a> <a href="Ronnie%20Boyce">Ronnie Boyce</a> who made his debut for West Ham in 1960.
Mark Noble Young Hammer of the Year Award.
In honour of <a href="Mark%20Noble">Mark Noble</a>, who was also the award winner in 2004, and had been serving the club since 2000 and retired in 2022, the Young Hammer of the Year award was renamed to Mark Noble Young Hammer of the Year Award on 9 May 2022.

Managers.
West Ham United have had 17 permanent managers in their history and an additional three caretaker managers.
Ownership and chairmen.
In January 2010, <a href="David%20Sullivan%20%28businessman%29">David Sullivan</a> and <a href="David%20Gold%20%28businessman%29">David Gold</a> acquired a 50% share in West Ham, given them overall operational and commercial control. At the end of May 2010, Gold and Sullivan purchased a further 10% stake in the club at a cost of £8 million. Taking their controlling stake to 60%, they announced that they could open up shares for fans to purchase. On 9 August 2010, Gold and Sullivan increased their shares up to 30.6% each with "minority investors", (which included former owner Terry Brown, purchasing a further 3.8% of the club at a cost of around −4 million) leaving Icelandic <a href="Straumur%20Investment%20Bank">Straumur Investment Bank</a> owning 35% of the club.
On 2 July 2013, Sullivan acquired a further 25% of shares after restructuring the debt of the club, leaving Straumur Bank with just 10%. In order to clear club debts before a move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016, in December 2014 Sullivan announced the availability for sale of 20% of the club. The clearing of club debts, given in July 2013 as £70 million, was given as a pre-condition to a move to the Olympic Stadium.
In September 2017, American billionaire <a href="J.%20Albert%20%26quot%3BTripp%26quot%3B%20Smith">J. Albert "Tripp" Smith</a>, senior management director of <a href="Blackstone%20Inc.">Blackstone Inc.</a>, bought 10% of the shares of the club. On 10 November 2021, the club announced Czech billionaire <a href="Daniel%20K%C5%99et%C3%ADnsk%C3%BD">Daniel Křetínský</a> had acquired 27% of the shares of the club, reducing Gold and Sullivan's shares.
Co-chairman David Gold died on 4 January 2023, leaving Sullivan as the sole chairman. Seven months later, Gold's daughter <a href="Vanessa%20Gold%20%28businesswoman%29">Vanessa</a> became joint-chair with Sullivan.

Derby County F.C.

Derby County Football Club () is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club in <a href="Derby">Derby</a>, England. The team competes in <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a>, the third level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. 
Notable for being one of the 12 founder members of the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1888, Derby County is one of only 10 clubs to have competed in every season of the English football league system, with all but six of those being in the top two divisions.
The club was founded in 1884 by William Morley as an offshoot of Derbyshire County Cricket Club. Its competitive peak came in the 1970s when it twice won the First Division and competed in major European competitions on four occasions, reaching the European Cup semi-finals as well as winning several minor trophies. Additionally, the club was a strong force in the interwar years – finishing league runner-up twice in the 1930s – and winning the first post-war FA Cup in 1946.
The club's home colours have been black and white since the 1890s. The team's nickname, The Rams, honours its links with the First Regiment of Derby Militia, its mascot being a <a href="sheep">ram</a>, and its <a href="The%20Derby%20Ram%20%28song%29">regimental song</a>. They have a long-standing rivalry with <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, with whom they contest the <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.%E2%80%93Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.%20rivalry">East Midlands derby</a>.
History.
Beginning and early success.
Derby County F.C. was formed in 1884 as an offshoot of <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire County Cricket Club</a> in an attempt to give players and supporters a winter interest as well as secure the cricket club extra revenue. The original intention was to name the club "Derbyshire County F.C." to highlight the link, though the Derbyshire FA, formed in 1883, objected on the grounds it was too long and therefore would not have been understood by the fans who may mistake it for a Derbyshire FA team. Playing their home matches at the cricket club's <a href="Racecourse%20Ground%2C%20Derby">Racecourse Ground</a>, 1884–85 saw the club undertake an extensive programme of friendly matches, the first of which was a 6–0 defeat to Great Lever on 13 September 1884. The club's first competitive match came in the <a href="1884%E2%80%9385%20FA%20Cup">1885 FA Cup</a>, where they lost 7–0 at home to <a href="Walsall%20Town%20F.C.">Walsall Town</a>.
Arguably the most important match in the club's history came in the <a href="1885%E2%80%9386%20FA%20Cup">following season</a>'s FA Cup, when a 2–0 victory over <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, already an emerging force in English football, established Derby County on the English football map, helping the club to attract better opposition for friendlies and, in 1888, an invitation into the inaugural <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a>. The opening day of the first ever league season was 8 September 1888, when Derby came from 3–0 down away to <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> to win 6–3, though the club ultimately finished 10th out of 12 teams. In 1891, they absorbed another Derby club, <a href="Derby%20Midland%20F.C.">Derby Midland</a>, which had been a member of the <a href="Midland%20Football%20League%20%281889%29">Midland League</a>, leaving them as Derby's sole professional football club. <a href="Steve%20Bloomer">Steve Bloomer</a>, generally considered to be Derby County's best-ever player, joined the club in 1892. In 1895, the club moved to a new stadium, the <a href="Baseball%20Ground">Baseball Ground</a> (so called because it was previously used for baseball), which became their home for the next 102 years. It was then that the club adopted their now traditional home colours of black and white.
Although Derby were inconsistent in the league, they finished as runners-up to Aston Villa in <a href="1895%E2%80%9396%20Football%20League">1896</a>, and achieved a number of third-place finishes. They were a strong force in the FA Cup, appearing in three finals in six years around the turn of the 20th century, though lost all three, in 1898 (3–1 to <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>), 1899 (4–1 to <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>) and 1903 (6–0 to <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>).
Edwardian and interwar era.
In 1906, <a href="Steve%20Bloomer">Steve Bloomer</a> was sold to <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> due to financial constraints, and Derby subsequently suffered its first ever relegation the following <a href="1906%E2%80%9307%20Football%20League">season</a>, but under <a href="Jimmy%20Methven">Jimmy Methven</a>'s management, they re-signed Bloomer and regained their <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> place in 1911. In 1914, they were again relegated, but instantly won the Second Division to earn promotion, though World War I meant they had to wait until 1919 to play First Division football again. After two seasons, they were relegated yet again in 1921. However, the appointment of <a href="George%20Jobey">George Jobey</a> in 1925 kick-started a successful period for the "Rams" and, after promotion in 1926, the club became a formidable force, with high finishes from the late 1920s and all through the 1930s, including finishing as runners-up twice.
Derby were one of several clubs to close down after the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> but restarted in the early 1940s, in part due to the persistence of Jack Nicholas and Jack Webb. Aided by the recruitment of <a href="Raich%20Carter">Raich Carter</a> and <a href="Peter%20Doherty%20%28footballer%29">Peter Doherty</a>, who had both been stationed in <a href="Loughborough">Loughborough</a> during the war, Derby were one step ahead of the opposition when competitive football resumed with the <a href="1945%E2%80%9346%20FA%20Cup">1946 FA Cup</a> and won their first major trophy with a 4–1 victory over <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>.
Post-war success and decline.
The league restarted the following season after a break due to World War II and, under the management of Stuart McMillan, as well as twice breaking the British transfer record to sign <a href="Billy%20Steel">Billy Steel</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Morris%20%28footballer%29">Johnny Morris</a> to replace Carter and Doherty, finished fourth and third in the 1948 and 1949 seasons respectively, before a steady decline set in and the club was relegated in 1953, after nearly 30 years in the top flight, and again in 1955 to drop to the third tier of English football for the first time in their history. <a href="Harry%20Storer%20Jr.">Harry Storer</a> led Derby back into the second tier at the second attempt in <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1957</a>, though the club progressed no further over the next decade under either Storer or his successor, former Derby player <a href="Tim%20Ward%20%28footballer%29">Tim Ward</a>.
Brian Clough era.
In 1967, <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a> and <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201928%29">Peter Taylor</a> took over and led Derby to its greatest glory. Starting at 18th in the Second Division in 1968, Clough and Taylor acquired <a href="Alan%20Hinton">Alan Hinton</a>, <a href="Roy%20McFarland">Roy McFarland</a>, and <a href="John%20O%27Hare">John O'Hare</a>, then clinched the influential signing of <a href="Dave%20Mackay">Dave Mackay</a> to lead the club to 1st place in 1969, and promotion to the First Division. Derby went on to finish fourth in 1970, were banned from competing in Europe due to financial irregularities in 1971, and won their first ever Football League Championship in 1972. Though Derby did not retain their title the following season, they did reach the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20European%20Cup%23Semi-finals">semi-finals</a> of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>, where they lost to <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>. Clough's frequent outspoken comments against football's establishment eventually led to him falling out with the board of directors at the club, and Clough and Taylor left in October 1973. Such was their impact on the club that, 37 years later, a 9 ft (2.75 metres) bronze statue of the pair was erected outside <a href="Pride%20Park%20Stadium">Pride Park</a> in commemoration of their legacy.
Success and decline after Clough.
Despite the departure of Clough and Taylor, Derby's league success was repeated in the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75 season</a> when they won the title under successor Dave Mackay, who had been a player under Clough when they had returned to the top flight in 1969. However, Derby's form declined towards the end of the 1970s and they went down to the Second Division in 1980 after a string of managers, including former <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> boss <a href="Tommy%20Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a>, unsettled the club trying desperately to maintain its place at the top of the First Division. Though they challenged well in their first season, Derby were soon hit hard by rising debts, falling attendances and dismal performances. Peter Taylor returned to the Baseball Ground as manager in early 1983 and kept Derby up that season, but he retired a year later just before Derby's relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for only the second time in their history. However, Derby did manage to avoid going out of business, and they were soon under the ownership of wealthy businessman <a href="Robert%20Maxwell">Robert Maxwell</a>. 
1980s revival and promotion to Premier League.
After relegation to the Third Division in May 1984, the club appointed <a href="Arthur%20Cox%20%28footballer%29">Arthur Cox</a> as manager. Although they missed out on promotion in Cox's first season as manager, they then won back-to-back promotions and were back in the First Division for the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football">1987–88 season</a>, with attendances also rising as the club's on-the-field fortunes and financial position improved. The financial backing of new chairman Robert Maxwell saw stars such as <a href="Peter%20Shilton">Peter Shilton</a>, <a href="Mark%20Wright%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201963%29">Mark Wright</a>, <a href="Dean%20Saunders">Dean Saunders</a>, <a href="Trevor%20Hebberd">Trevor Hebberd</a> and <a href="Ted%20McMinn">Ted McMinn</a> brought to the club and they finished fifth in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89 season</a>.
A lack of any further investment from Maxwell quickly led to a decline and discontent amongst the club's fans, culminating in relegation back to the Second Division in 1991 when the club finished bottom of the First Division with just five wins all season. At this time, local newspaper businessman <a href="Lionel%20Pickering">Lionel Pickering</a> became the majority shareholder of the club, taking control just before Maxwell's death in November 1991. In 1992, Derby County paid £2.5 million for <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> central defender <a href="Craig%20Short">Craig Short</a>, at the time – and for five years afterwards – the most expensive player to be signed by a club outside the top flight, and indeed one of the highest fees paid by any English club for a player at the time. Other expensive signings included strikers <a href="Tommy%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201971%29">Tommy Johnson</a> and <a href="Marco%20Gabbiadini">Marco Gabbiadini</a>. Cox's resignation as manager in October 1993 saw the appointment of legendary former player <a href="Roy%20McFarland">Roy McFarland</a> as manager. Derby reached the final of the Division One playoffs that season, but were beaten by local rivals <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>. McFarland was sacked a year later after Derby missed out on the playoffs, and his replacement was <a href="Jim%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201940%29">Jim Smith</a> – a manager whose track record at his previous clubs included four promotions and an FA Cup semi-final appearance.
Although the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96 season</a> started slowly, the signing of sweeper <a href="Igor%20%C5%A0timac">Igor Štimac</a> in the early autumn proved pivotal. Smith guided the "Rams" to a second-place finish and the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, now the top flight of English football. During that season, it was announced Derby would be leaving the Baseball Ground after more than 100 years to move into a new all-seater stadium, following earlier plans to develop the Baseball Ground as a 26,000-seat stadium.
After finishing in 12th place in their first season back in the top flight, the club left the Baseball Ground, its home of 102 years, to move into the new 33,597-seat <a href="Pride%20Park%20Stadium">Pride Park Stadium</a> for the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98 season</a>. The Baseball Ground was demolished six years later and a memorial was eventually erected in memory of its role in Derby city history.
Relegation from top flight and financial crisis.
The club settled well into its new home as it recorded back-to-back top 10 finishes for the first time since their 1970s peak, before a sudden decline at the turn of the millennium saw three years of struggle. Smith resigned to be replaced by former players <a href="Colin%20Todd">Colin Todd</a>, who lasted just three months, and <a href="John%20Gregory%20%28footballer%29">John Gregory</a>, before the "Rams" were relegated after a six-year stay in the top flight, in 2002.
Derby County's relegation saw the club enter a serious financial crisis, which forced them to sell many key players. Gregory was later suspended from his managerial duties over alleged misconduct and former <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> boss <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a> was brought in. The club was put into <a href="receivership">receivership</a> then sold in October 2003 for £3 to a group led by <a href="Jeremy%20Keith">Jeremy Keith</a>. After finishing 20th in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04 season</a>, a dramatic improvement in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">2004–05 season</a> saw Derby finish fourth in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a>, qualifying for a promotion play-off spot, though they lost in the semi-finals to <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>. Soon afterwards, Burley resigned citing differences between himself and the board. He was replaced by Bolton Wanderers first team coach <a href="Phil%20Brown%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201959%29">Phil Brown</a>. In January 2006, Brown was sacked after a poor run of results. Terry Westley, the academy coach at the time, took over first-team duties until the end of the season and saved Derby from relegation.
Return to the Premier League and straight back to the Championship.
In April 2006, a consortium of local businessmen led by former vice-chairman <a href="Peter%20Gadsby">Peter Gadsby</a> purchased the club, reducing its debt and returning Pride Park Stadium to the club's ownership in the process. In June 2006, former Preston North End boss <a href="Billy%20Davies">Billy Davies</a> was appointed Derby County's new permanent manager. In his first season, Davies took Derby to the Championship <a href="play-off">play-off</a>s, where they beat <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> on penalties in the semi-finals before defeating <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> 1–0 with a second-half <a href="Stephen%20Pearson">Stephen Pearson</a> goal at the new <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> to secure a return to the Premier League and the associated £60 million windfall.
After failing to win any of their opening five matches of the season (one draw and four consecutive defeats), Derby scored their first victory with a 1–0 win over Newcastle, where <a href="Kenny%20Miller">Kenny Miller</a> scored the only goal of the game. In October 2007, Peter Gadsby stepped down as chairman to be replaced by former <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> owner <a href="Adam%20Pearson%20%28sports%20executive%29">Adam Pearson</a>, who immediately began searching for investment from overseas. After a poor start to the season, manager Billy Davies left by mutual consent in November. He was succeeded by <a href="Paul%20Jewell">Paul Jewell</a>, who failed to save the club as Derby suffered the Premier League's earliest ever relegation, in March, recorded the Premier League's lowest-ever points total, and equalled <a href="Loughborough%20F.C.">Loughborough</a>'s 108-year Football League record of going through an entire season with only one win, which occurred during the 1899–1900 season when Loughborough finished bottom of the <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. In January 2008, Derby was taken over by an international investment group led by General Sports and Entertainment, with Pearson remaining as "de facto" chairman.
Derby's match at home to Sheffield United on 13 September 2008 generated much media coverage as it was approaching a year since Derby's last league win, a run which saw the club break the English league record for most matches without a win. Just four days short of the anniversary of the 1–0 victory over <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, <a href="Rob%20Hulse">Rob Hulse</a> scored against his former club as Derby ran out 2–1 winners, earning Paul Jewell his first league win as Derby boss at his 27th attempt. Despite taking the club to the League Cup semi-final, the club's first major cup semi-final since 1976, where Derby lost 4–3 to Manchester United over two legs, Jewell resigned as manager in December 2008 after a run of just two wins in 11 matches. He was replaced by <a href="Nigel%20Clough">Nigel Clough</a>, son of former manager Brian Clough. Nigel Clough led the club to 18th place and safety. After four years of midtable obscurity, Clough was replaced by <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a> in September 2013; McClaren led the club to a 3rd-place finish in the <a href="2013-14%20Football%20League%20Championship">2013–14 season</a>, but lost the play-off final to <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers">Queens Park Rangers</a>.
Play-off heartaches, administration and relegation.
The following season local businessman <a href="Mel%20Morris%20%28businessman%29">Mel Morris</a> assumed ownership of the club. Morris initially oversaw a level of spending unprecedented in Derby's history, breaking the club's transfer record four times in his first three years, but also oversaw an equally unprecedented managerial turnover, with nine managers in six years from <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Derby%20County%20F.C.%20season">June 2015</a>. In that period, the club endured three unsuccessful play-off campaigns, failing in the semi-finals twice and losing in the <a href="2019%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2019 final</a> to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. In May 2021, the club, by then managed by <a href="Wayne%20Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a>, narrowly avoided relegation to League One. In May 2021, the possibility of EFL sanctions arose amidst allegations of breaches of <a href="UEFA%20Financial%20Fair%20Play%20Regulations">financial fair play regulations</a>. On 8 July 2021, the EFL imposed a transfer embargo on the club, leaving Rooney with a squad of just nine contracted senior professionals. 
On 17 September 2021, the club's board of directors announced that the club was to go into <a href="administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>, and the <a href="English%20Football%20League">EFL</a> confirmed Derby faced a 12-point deduction. On 16 November, the club had a further deduction of nine points for breaching EFL accounting rules. A further three-point deduction, for breaches of EFL profitability and sustainability rules, was suspended. Derby and related companies were reported to owe £29.3m to HMRC. Other liabilities included a £20m loan from US investment group MSD Holdings, plus various football and trade creditors owed around £15m. On 2 December, after press speculation that the club might go into <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a> due to the scale of its debts, Rooney insisted that was not an option. Following a defeat at <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">QPR</a>, Derby County were relegated to League One.
On 26 June 2022, after Derbyshire-based property developer <a href="David%20Clowes">David Clowes</a> had purchased Pride Park, his bid to buy the club was accepted, and Quantuma granted Clowes preferred bidder status. The administrators said Clowes's offer complied with EFL insolvency policy, meaning Derby would avoid a further points deduction. The deal, and the club's exit from administration, was eventually confirmed on 1 July 2022, though some constraints on transfers were agreed by the EFL and Derby's new owners. The club's transfer embargo was finally lifted in May 2023.
In September 2022, Derby approached <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a> to request permission to speak to <a href="Paul%20Warne">Paul Warne</a>, who was announced as the club's new head coach on a four-year-deal on 22 September 2022. The side vied for promotion, but missed out on the League One play-offs, finishing 7th.
Club identity.
Crest.
Like most old football clubs, Derby County did not initially have any badge displayed on their shirts. Their first badge was introduced in 1924. The badge consisted of a circular shield split into three equally sized sections, representing the club, its fans and the area, all containing items traditionally associated with the city of Derby: a <a href="Tudor%20rose">Tudor rose</a> and a <a href="crown%20%28headgear%29">crown</a> in one section, a <a href="deer">buck</a> in a park in the second and a <a href="domestic%20sheep">ram</a>'s head in the final section. The badge was worn on the players' shirts for just two seasons before they reverted to plain shirts.
By 1934, another badge had been introduced. This time it was a traditionally shaped shield, again with three sections. The buck in the park had been removed and the rose and the crown had been split up and now occupied a section each. The ram's head also remained and was now given the largest section of the shield. The badge never appeared on the players' shirts. The shield was modified in 1946 when the rose and crown were removed and replaced with the letters "DC" (Derby County) and "FC" (Football Club) respectively. The badge, right, was featured on the player's shirts from its introduction onwards, though the ram's head on its own was used from the late 1960s (the full shield, however, remained the club's official logo).
A new club badge was introduced in 1971, featuring a more modern design that, with modifications, is still in use. The badge initially consisted of a stylised white ram facing left. The badge was first modified slightly in 1979 to include the text "Derby County FC" under the ram (though the ram remained on its own on away kits). In 1982, the ram turned to face to the right and the text under it was removed. The ram was surrounded by a wreath of laurel and the text "Centenary 1984–1985" was printed underneath for the club's centenary season. The laurel was removed and the text reading "Derby County FC" returned from the next season. In 1993, the ram faced left again and the text was removed once more. From 1995, the ram faced right and was enclosed in a diamond, with a gold banner reading "Derby County FC" underneath and the text "1884" (the year of the club's foundation) underneath that. The design was changed again in 1997 (see left): the ram now faced left and the golden banner now simply read "Derby County"; the diamond and year of formation were removed.
A decade later, in 2007, the badge was modified again with the ram still facing left and the text "Est. 1884" now in the middle of a circular frame featuring "Derby County Football Club" in gold lettering, with the colours being modified to the club colours of black and white in 2009 (see top of page). In July 2012, the club announced its intention to show only the iconic ram, now just an outline, on future shirts, rather than the full club logo. In July 2013, this traditional ram became the club's full logo again.
Colours.
Derby County's original colours (right) were amber, chocolate and blue, though by the 1890s the club had adopted its now traditional colours of black and white, which are still in use today. In the 1970s and 1980s, colours for home matches were white shirts with small blue or red touches (on the club badge or shirt makers insignia), blue shorts and socks that were blue, red, white or a combination of the three. The colours of away kits have varied widely, and although they are usually yellow/gold or blue, the colour for the away kit for the 2008–09 season was fluorescent green. The club also introduced a surprise third kit in August 2008. Similar in design to the club's away kit of the 1970s, with blue and white stripes and reminiscent of the <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina national team</a> strip, the style was re-introduced following feedback from fans who said it was one of their favourite kits from the club's past.
Club mascot.
Derby's mascot is a ram named Rammie, who also works to maintain the club's links with fans and the East Midlands in general, such as school visits to promote literacy and charity events. Rammie originally emerged as a more friendly option to the club's traditional links with the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and the <a href="Mercian%20Regiment">Mercian Regiment</a> in <a href="Mercian%20Regiment%23Mascot">particular</a>.
Rammie was the first full-time mascot in British football. Rammie's traditional activities include penalty shoot-outs with members of the crowd at half-time, with Rammie as goalkeeper, and warming the crowd up before the match and encouraging the Derby fans during matches. Rammie is a very popular figure amongst Rams fans and, in 2005, released his first DVD, which features the character reading from <a href="Aesop%27s%20Fables">Aesop's Fables</a> in the Derbyshire countryside.
Shortly thereafter, Rammie was joined by a female equivalent and his sister, named Eweie. However, Eweie did not last very long at Pride Park, and took a reported "vacation" to the United States. She returned from a 10-year exile on 3 October 2015 at a home match against <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>.
Grounds.
As an offshoot of the cricket club, Derby County's first home stadium was the <a href="County%20Cricket%20Ground%2C%20Derby">County Cricket Ground</a>, also known as the Racecourse Ground, where the club played between 1884 and 1895. Although the ground itself was good enough to hold the first FA Cup final match outside <a href="London">London</a>, when <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> beat West Bromwich Albion 2–0 in the <a href="1886%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1886 FA Cup final replay</a>, and a full <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England international</a>, disputes over fixture clashes between the football and cricket clubs meant that when the opportunity to play at <a href="Francis%20Ley">Sir Francis Ley's</a> <a href="Baseball%20Ground">Baseball Ground</a> arose, the club accepted.
Commonly referred to amongst supporters as "the BBG", the club moved to the Baseball Ground in 1895 and remained there for the next 102 years, despite opportunities to move in the 1920s and 1940s. Derby had already played there, a 1–0 win over <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C">Sunderland</a> during the <a href="1891%E2%80%9392%20Football%20League">1891–92 season</a>, as an alternative venue after a fixture clash at the County Ground. At its peak during the late 1960s, the ground could hold around 42,000 – the club's record attendance achieved following the opening of the Ley Stand with a 41,826 crowd watching a 5–0 defeat of <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> on 20 September 1969. From this peak, the continued addition of seating saw the capacity drop over the next 15 years to 26,500 in 1985.
Following the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> in 1989, and the legal requirement for all-seater stadia, the ground's capacity dwindled to just 18,500 by the mid-1990s, not enough for the then ambitious second-tier club. Despite initially hoping to rebuild the Baseball Ground to hold 26,000 spectators, and rejecting the offer of two sites elsewhere in Derby, then-chairman <a href="Lionel%20Pickering">Lionel Pickering</a> announced in February 1996 the intention to move to a new, purpose-built stadium at the newly regenerated <a href="Pride%20Park">Pride Park</a>, with the last first-team game at the Baseball Ground being in May 1997, a 1–3 home defeat to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, though it continued to host reserve matches until 2003. Derby's new ground, named <a href="Pride%20Park%20Stadium">Pride Park Stadium</a>, was officially opened by the <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen</a> on 18 July with a friendly against Italian club <a href="U.C.%20Sampdoria">Sampdoria</a> following on 4 August.
Derby hold the unique distinction of being the only club to have had three home grounds host full England internationals. England beat <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Ireland</a> 9–0 at the <a href="County%20Cricket%20Ground%2C%20Derby">Racecourse Ground</a> in 1895, beat Ireland again, 2–1, at the Baseball Ground in 1911 and, most recently, Pride Park hosted England's 4–0 win over <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a> in May 2001.
Pride Park was renamed the iPro Stadium on 7 December 2013, as part of a 10-year, £7 million sponsorship deal with global sports drink company iPro. At the beginning of 2017, it reverted to its original name of Pride Park Stadium.
<a href="Clowes%20Developments">Clowes Developments (UK) Ltd</a> purchased Pride Park from Mel Morris on 17 June 2022.
Supporters and rivalry.
Support.
Derby is often acknowledged as a "passionate football town" by rival supporters and the press alike. Tony Francis of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" noted, "Derby is a passionate football town... Even in Division Two, it's a reasonable bet that crowds at Pride Park would not fall far below 30,000. It's historical, it's geographical, it's in the blood. Some places have it, some don't." During the 2007–08 Premier League season, Derby County fans were repeatedly referred to as the best in the country (England) due to their loyalty despite the club's disastrous campaign. Almost every home match at Pride Park Stadium was sold out to the Derby fans and the club also had a large following away from home. The recognition included them being named fans of the season in much national coverage of the season, winning an award from <a href="Nuts%20%28magazine%29">"Nuts" magazine</a>, and being named the most loyal supporters in the country in a 2008 survey by "Sky Sports Magazine". In 2013, Derby supporter Nick Webster was voted <a href="Football%20League%20Awards%232013%20Awards">Championship Fan of the Year</a>.
Statistically, the club had the 12th-highest average attendance in the country in the 2007–08, 2008–09, and 2009–10 seasons, despite only having the <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20stadia%20by%20capacity">15th-largest club ground</a> and finishing 18th or lower in their respective division. In 2008–09, they were the best supported club in the Championship, with a larger average attendance than nine Premier League clubs, and had the Football League's single largest league match attendance, with 33,079 against <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> on 13 April 2009. Since moving to the Pride Park Stadium in 1997, Derby's average attendance has never dropped before 23,000 and they have finished in the top 20 for highest average attendances in 19 out of 23 seasons, despite spending the majority of the time in the second tier.
Derby's celebrity supporters include actors <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a> and <a href="Robert%20Lindsay%20%28actor%29">Robert Lindsay</a>, former Labour MP <a href="Dennis%20Skinner">Dennis Skinner</a>, <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> singer <a href="Niall%20Horan">Niall Horan</a>, <a href="Blur%20%28band%29">Blur</a> guitarist <a href="Graham%20Coxon">Graham Coxon</a>, <a href="The%20Gaslight%20Anthem">The Gaslight Anthem</a> guitarist <a href="Alex%20Rosamilia">Alex Rosamilia</a>, adult film star <a href="Keiran%20Lee">Keiran Lee</a> and actor <a href="Jack%20O%27Connell%20%28actor%29">Jack O'Connell</a>. It has been reported that O'Connell has persuaded other celebrities to support the club, including actress <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, and model <a href="Cara%20Delevingne">Cara Delevingne</a>.
Rivalries.
Derby's primary rival clubs are <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> and <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>.
Forest, based in <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>, east of Derby, are by far the fiercest rivals; a 2008 survey named the rivalry the 11th-largest in English football, revealing that nine out of 10 fans from both clubs point to the other as their fiercest rival, whilst a 2020 survey listed it joint-12th. Meetings between the side are known as <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.%E2%80%93Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.%20rivalry">East Midlands derbies</a> and the winning team is awarded the <a href="Brian%20Clough%20Trophy">Brian Clough Trophy</a>. The rivalry as a whole largely developed from the 1970s, due to former Derby manager <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a> taking over at Forest, much to the anger of the Derby fans. The rivalry has been seen to be as much about which club owns Clough's heart as the proximity of the clubs geographically.
The rivalry with Leicester stems from location, as well as Leicester winning in the 1994 play-off final.
Leeds United are disliked due to ongoing friction from the early 1970s when Derby and Leeds were two of the top English teams and the scarcely concealed hostility between their respective managers, Brian Clough and <a href="Don%20Revie">Don Revie</a> and is documented in the <a href="The%20Damned%20Utd">novel</a> and <a href="The%20Damned%20United">film</a> "The Damned United". This rivalry is traditionally stronger on Derby's side: while Derby consider Leeds their second or third-biggest rivals, Leeds fans focus more on their dislike of Manchester United and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, however the rivalry intensified once more in the <a href="2018-19%20EFL%20Championship">2018–19</a> season following the 'Spygate' scandal, <a href="2019%20English%20Football%20League%20play-offs%23Championship">play-off semi-final</a> and increased animosity between the managers, staff and fans of both clubs.
A 2019 study called 'The League of Love And Hate' reported Derby fan's top five rivals as <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> (88%), <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> (64%), <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> (63%), <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> (43%) and <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> (30%). Derby themselves appeared in the top fives of Forest (1st – 77%), Leicester (2nd – 60%), <a href="Burton%20Albion%20F.C.">Burton Albion</a> (3rd – 56%), Leeds (5th – 30%) and Stoke (5th – 28%).

Club academy.
Moor Farm.
Derby County's academy, called Moor Farm, is a purpose-built complex situated near the city suburb of <a href="Oakwood%2C%20Derbyshire">Oakwood</a>. It was built in 2003, at a cost of £5 million, to replace the club's previous academy, The Ram-Arena, which was based at Raynesway. It covers and features six full-sized training pitches plus an indoor pitch and includes a gym, restaurant, ProZone room and a laundry. When opening the academy, then-Chairman <a href="Lionel%20Pickering">Lionel Pickering</a> said that the intent was to have "at least eight players from the Academy... in the first-team within three years." Although this was not achieved, the academy produced a number of notable players, including England international midfielder <a href="Tom%20Huddlestone">Tom Huddlestone</a>, <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales international</a> defender <a href="Lewin%20Nyatanga">Lewin Nyatanga</a>, <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Northern Ireland international</a> goalkeeper <a href="Lee%20Camp%20%28footballer%29">Lee Camp</a>, <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England under-21s</a> players <a href="Miles%20Addison">Miles Addison</a> and <a href="Lee%20Grant%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29">Lee Grant</a>, as well as <a href="England%20national%20under-19%20football%20team">England under-19</a> player <a href="Giles%20Barnes">Giles Barnes</a>.
In April 2009, new manager Nigel Clough announced his intention to restructure the academy, appointing former Derby players <a href="Darren%20Wassall">Darren Wassall</a> and <a href="Michael%20Forsyth%20%28footballer%29">Michael Forsyth</a> and Wolverhampton Wanderers Academy director John Perkins to the backroom staff, replacing the departed Phil Cannon, <a href="David%20Lowe%20%28footballer%29">David Lowe</a> and Brian Burrows. Following this, and an increased investment of £1 million per year from the club, a number of players broke through to the first team squad ahead of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Derby%20County%20F.C.%20season%23Current%20squad">2010–11 season</a>, almost a third of the Derby squad were academy graduates, with <a href="Mason%20Bennett">Mason Bennett</a> setting the club record for youngest first team appearance when he made his full debut with a start in a defeat at Middlesbrough on 22 October 2011 at the age of 15 years and 99 days old. This helped strengthen the academy's reputation and reinforced CEO Tom Glick's stated desire to make Moor Farm "the academy of choice in the Midlands." In August 2012, Derby's academy became a tier 2 academy under the new controversial <a href="Elite%20Player%20Performance%20Plan">Elite Player Performance Plan</a>. It was awarded Tier 1 status two years later in July 2014. Focus on the academy continued during the ownership of <a href="Mel%20Morris%20%28businessman%29">Mel Morris</a> after his purchase of the club later that year and, at the end of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">2019–20 season</a> Derby had given more first-team minutes to players aged under 21 than any other club in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Football League Championship</a>, with academy graduates such as <a href="Max%20Bird">Max Bird</a>, <a href="Louie%20Sibley">Louie Sibley</a>, <a href="Jason%20Knight%20%28footballer%29">Jason Knight</a>, <a href="Jayden%20Bogle">Jayden Bogle</a>, <a href="Morgan%20Whittaker">Morgan Whittaker</a> and <a href="Lee%20Buchanan%20%28footballer%29">Lee Buchanan</a> getting a total of 7,946 minutes in the league during the campaign. When discussing targets for the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">2020–21 campaign</a>, Morris stated "We are not going to see a team of 11 players from the Academy featuring this season (2019/20) but the target for next season (is) 50% of our starting 11 should be Academy players. That (is) our target, and I think there is a possibility we could get there."
Derby County in Europe.
Derby first competed in Europe when they entered the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20European%20Cup">1972–73 European Cup</a> after winning the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20in%20English%20football%23First%20Division">1971–72 First Division Title</a>, reaching the semi-final stages, where they lost 3–1 on aggregate to <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> in controversial circumstances. They had qualified for the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1970–71 Fairs Cup</a> after finishing the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20in%20English%20football%23First%20Division">1969–70 First Division</a> in 4th, but were banned from entering the competition for financial irregularities. The 70s was Derby County's peak in English football, and they qualified for Europe in three of the next four seasons, competing in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> or the <a href="European%20Cup">European Cup</a> in each of the three seasons between <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75</a> and <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77</a>.
The club then declined rapidly and has not appeared in the top European competitions since, though it finished in 5th in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1989 First Division</a> which would have guaranteed entry into the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20UEFA%20Cup">1989–90 UEFA Cup</a> had English Clubs not been banned from Europe following the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20Disaster">Heysel Stadium Disaster</a>.
Outside of major competition, the club competed in the <a href="Anglo-Italian%20Cup">Anglo-Italian Cup</a> between <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a> and <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95</a>, reaching the final in 1993, losing 3–1 to <a href="U.S.%20Cremonese">Cremonese</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a>.
Records and statistics.
<a href="Kevin%20Hector">Kevin Hector</a> holds the record for Derby County appearances in all competitions, appearing 589 times in two spells with the club between 1966 and 1982. He sits ahead of <a href="Ron%20Webster">Ron Webster</a>, who played 535 times for the club. Just counting league appearances, Hector is again in the lead with 486 appearances, ahead of Jack Parry, who played 483 times for the club between 1948 and 1967. The club's all-time top goalscorer is <a href="Steve%20Bloomer">Steve Bloomer</a>, who netted 332 goals for the club in two spells between 1892 and 1914. He is over 100 goals ahead of second in the list Kevin Hector, who netted 201 goals for the club. <a href="Jack%20Bowers">Jack Bowers</a> holds the club record for most goals in a single season, when he scored 43 goals (35 in the league and a further 8 in the FA Cup), during the <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20in%20English%20football">1932–33 season</a>. The record league scorer for a season is Jack Bowers and <a href="Ray%20Straw">Ray Straw</a> with 37 goals in the <a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20in%20English%20football">1930–31</a> and <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57</a> seasons respectively. 
The club's record attendance is 41,826, for a <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> match against <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> at the Baseball Ground on 20 September 1969, which Derby won 5–0. The record is unlikely to be broken in the near future as Derby's current stadium, Pride Park Stadium, has a limit of 33,597 spectators. The record attendance at Pride Park for a competitive Derby County match is 33,378 for a Premier League match against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> on 18 March 2000. The largest crowd to ever watch a Derby County game is 120,000 when Derby County played <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> in the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20European%20Cup">1975–76 European Cup</a>.
Derby's historically poor <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.%20season%202007%E2%80%9308">2007–08 Premier League campaign</a> saw the club set and equal several unwanted <a href="Football%20records%20in%20England">records in English football</a>. The club equalled Loughborough's all-time league record of just one win in an entire league season. They also equalled or set several Premier League records (1992–present), including fewest home wins in a season (1, joint with Sunderland), least goals (20, initially set, but now held jointly with <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>) fewest away wins in a season (0, joint with five other clubs), and most defeats in a season (29, joint with three other clubs). Unmatched records include fewest points in a season (three points for a win) with 11; and worst goal difference (−69). The club also holds the joint record for most consecutive league games without a win (with <a href="Macclesfield%20Town">Macclesfield Town</a>), with 36 matches over two seasons between 22 September 2007 and 13 September 2008.
Derby also own (alongside <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>), the joint record for most lopsided defeat in an FA Cup final, a 6–0 loss to Bury in 1903.
All-time XI.
As part of the club's 125th Anniversary celebrations, it was announced that during 2009 each month a vote would be carried out to decide on the club's official All Time XI, starting in February 2009 with the <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a>, with the following eight months offering opportunities for Derby's support to select a team based within a <a href="4%E2%80%934%E2%80%932">4–4–2 formation</a>, with December's vote being reserved for the manager. Voting closed on the 25th of each month, with the winner being announced in the following few days.

History.
Early years (1899–1920).
Following a meeting at the home of <a href="lithographic">lithographic</a> artist <a href="Bartley%20Wilson">Bartley Wilson</a> in Cardiff, the club was founded in 1899 as Riverside A.F.C. as a way of keeping players from the Riverside Cricket Club together and in shape during the winter months. In their first season, they played <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendlies</a> against local sides at their <a href="Sophia%20Gardens">Sophia Gardens</a> ground. In 1900 they joined the <a href="Cardiff%20%26amp%3B%20District%20League">Cardiff & District League</a> for their first competitive season. When <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King Edward VII</a> granted Cardiff city status in 1905, the club put in a request to the <a href="South%20Wales%20and%20Monmouthshire%20Football%20Association">South Wales and Monmouthshire Football Association</a> to change their name to Cardiff City. The request was turned down as they were deemed not to be playing at a high enough level. To enhance their standing, the team arranged to join the <a href="South%20Wales%20League">South Wales League</a> in 1907. The following year they were granted permission to change the name of the club to Cardiff City.
Although growing in stature, the club was forced to turn down the opportunity to join the newly formed Second Division of the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern Football League</a> due to a lack of facilities at their Sophia Gardens ground. Over the next two years, Cardiff played friendlies against some of Britain's top professional sides, including <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>, <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a>, and <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>. The matches were played at grounds in Cardiff and nearby towns so as to gauge the level of public interest in the team. The club eventually secured land to build their own stadium, <a href="Ninian%20Park">Ninian Park</a>, which was completed in 1910. The club turned professional the same year. They made their first signing the following year with the acquisition of <a href="Jack%20Evans%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Jack Evans</a> from fellow Welsh side Cwmparc.
With the new ground in place, Cardiff joined the Southern Football League Second Division and appointed their first manager, <a href="Davy%20McDougall">Davy McDougall</a>, who became <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a>. They went on to finish in fourth place in their first year in the league. The board decided to replace McDougall with <a href="Fred%20Stewart%20%28football%20manager%29">Fred Stewart</a>, who had previous managerial experience with <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a>. He set about adopting a more professional approach, signing several players with Football League experience, including brothers <a href="John%20Burton%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201885%29">John</a> and <a href="George%20Burton%20%281910s%20footballer%29">George Burton</a> and <a href="Billy%20Hardy%20%28footballer%29">Billy Hardy</a>. Stewart led the team to promotion in his second season by winning the Second Division title. They remained in the First Division for the next decade, and finished in the top four on two occasions.
1920s success and later decline (1920–1945).
In 1920, the club submitted a successful application to join the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> and were placed into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> for the <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">1920–21 season</a>. Stewart brought in several players with Football League experience, breaking the club's transfer record on two occasions to sign <a href="Jimmy%20Gill">Jimmy Gill</a> and later <a href="Jimmy%20Blair%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201888%29">Jimmy Blair</a> from <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">The Wednesday</a>. They played their first match in the Football League on 28 August 1920, defeating Stockport County 5–2. The side finished the season in second place to win promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>. They finished behind <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> on <a href="Goal%20difference">goal average</a>, and reached the semi-final of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. In their third season in the top-tier, the team finished runners-up to <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> because of a goal average difference of 0.024. Cardiff drew their final match 0–0 as club record goalscorer <a href="Len%20Davies">Len Davies</a> missed a penalty.
The <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20in%20English%20football">following season</a> was the first time Cardiff appeared at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, having reached their first FA Cup final. The team lost 1–0 to <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> following a goal from <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> international <a href="Fred%20Tunstall">Fred Tunstall</a>. The <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20in%20English%20football">1926–27</a> season, when they finished in 14th position, was Cardiff's worst performance in the top tier of English Football since winning promotion six seasons before. However, they reached their second FA Cup final in the space of two years. On <a href="St%20George%27s%20Day">St George's Day</a>, 23 April 1927, at Wembley Stadium in London, Cardiff became the only non-English side to win the FA Cup by defeating <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 1–0 in the <a href="1927%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a>; <a href="Hughie%20Ferguson">Hughie Ferguson</a> scored the only goal of the game in the 74th minute. He received the ball from <a href="Ernie%20Curtis">Ernie Curtis</a> and hurried a tame shot toward the goal; <a href="Dan%20Lewis%20%28footballer%29">Dan Lewis</a>, the Arsenal goalkeeper, allowed the shot to slip through his grasp and knocked the ball into the net with his elbow. Captain <a href="Fred%20Keenor">Fred Keenor</a> received the FA Cup trophy at the end of the match from King <a href="George%20V">George V</a> only seven years after Cardiff City had entered the Football League. When the team returned to Cardiff the next day, a crowd of around 150,000 people lined the streets to welcome them.
The side also won the <a href="Welsh%20Cup">Welsh Cup</a> in 1927, defeating <a href="Rhyl%20F.C.">Rhyl</a> 2–0 and so becoming the only club to win the national cups of two countries in the same season. They went on to win the <a href="FA%20Charity%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a> after beating amateur side <a href="Corinthian%20F.C.">the Corinthians</a> 2–1 at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>. The club entered a period of decline after their cup success. They were relegated from the First Division in the <a href="1928-29%20in%20English%20football">1928–29</a> season, despite conceding fewer goals than any other side in the division. They suffered a second relegation two years later, dropping into the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> for the first time since they joined the Football League. During their first season in the division, Cardiff recorded their biggest-ever win when they beat <a href="Thames%20A.F.C.">Thames</a> by a scoreline of 9–2. They finished the <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20in%20English%20football">1932–33 season</a> in 19th place, resulting in manager Fred Stewart tendering his resignation from his post after 22 years in charge. Club founder Bartley Wilson stepped in to replace Stewart. Results continued to be disappointing, and in March 1934, <a href="Ben%20Watts-Jones">Ben Watts-Jones</a> was given the opportunity to manage the club he had supported as a youngster. He was unable to turn the team's fortunes around; they finished the season at the bottom of the table, and had to apply for re-election to the league. Watts-Jones remained in charge for another three years until <a href="Billy%20Jennings%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Bill Jennings</a> replaced him. Cardiff remained in the Third Division South until the Football League was suspended following the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.
Post war and European competition (1945–2000).
In their first season since the resumption of the Football League, under new manager <a href="Billy%20McCandless">Billy McCandless</a>, Cardiff finished the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20in%20English%20football">1946–47</a> season as champions of the Third Division South and returned to the Second Division. McCandless left the club soon after and was replaced by <a href="Cyril%20Spiers">Cyril Spiers</a> who led the side to promotion in the <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20in%20English%20football">1951–52</a> season. Cardiff returned to the top tier of English football for the first time in 23 years and stayed there for five seasons. They were relegated after in 1957, after struggling in the bottom half of the table for three seasons. They returned to the First Division for two seasons between 1960 and 1962 before they were again relegated.
During the 1960s, Cardiff participated in <a href="UEFA%20competitions">European competition</a> for the first time as a result of winning the Welsh Cup, which granted qualification to the newly created <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners Cup</a>. Their first ever match in European competition was in the tournament during the 1964–65 season against Danish side <a href="Esbjerg%20fB">Esbjerg fB</a>. The team won 1–0 on aggregate over two legs, the only goal being scored by <a href="Peter%20King%20%28footballer%20born%201943%29">Peter King</a>. They went on to reach the quarter-finals before being knocked out by <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a>. Despite their exploits in Europe, the team were still struggling in league competition under the stewardship of <a href="Jimmy%20Scoular">Jimmy Scoular</a>, finishing in 20th position in the Second Division. Two years later the team reached the semi-final of the Cup Winners Cup after victories over <a href="Shamrock%20Rovers%20F.C.">Shamrock Rovers</a>, <a href="NAC%20Breda">NAC Breda</a>, and <a href="Torpedo%20Moscow">Torpedo Moscow</a> set up a tie with German side <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburg</a>, whose squad contained several <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">German</a> internationals. This remains the furthest any Welsh side has advanced in European competition. After a 1–1 draw in the first leg, over 43,000 fans turned out at Ninian Park to watch Hamburg win 3–2. During the <a href="1970-71%20in%20English%20football">1970–71</a> season, Cardiff reached the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners Cup where they faced Spanish side <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. The first leg of the tie was held at Ninian Park where 47,000 fans watched one of the most significant victories in Cardiff's history when <a href="Brian%20Clark%20%28footballer%20born%201943%29">Brian Clark</a> headed in to give Cardiff a 1–0 win. They were later eliminated after losing the second leg 2–0. The team remained in the Second Division for 19 of the 20 seasons between 1962 and 1982, having been relegated to the Third Division for the 1975–76 season.
Cardiff were continuously in the lower two divisions of the Football League between 1985 and 1993. The club appointed several managers in attempts to turn the team's performances around with limited success. They were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> once in the <a href="1985-86%20in%20English%20football">1985–86</a> season and, despite returning to the Third Division on two occasions, they finished in their lowest-ever league position in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1996</a>—22nd of 24 in Division Three. In 1995, Cardiff and other Welsh clubs competing in English leagues were banned from entering the Welsh Cup by the <a href="Football%20Association%20of%20Wales">Football Association of Wales</a> after pressure from <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>, who did not want teams playing in two national cup competitions. Their final match in the competition was a 2–1 defeat to Wrexham in the <a href="1995%20Welsh%20Cup%20Final">1995 final</a>.
Foreign investment (2000–present).
In August 2000, Lebanese businessman <a href="Sam%20Hammam">Sam Hammam</a> purchased control of the club and replaced Steve Borley as chairman. Shortly after taking over, he controversially pledged to get the entire Welsh nation to support Cardiff by renaming the club "The Cardiff Celts" and changing the club colours to green, red and white. After lengthy talks with senior players and fans, he decided the best policy was not to change the name of the club. The club crest was redesigned; the new design incorporated the Cardiff City bluebird in front of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Saint%20David">Flag of Saint David</a> and featured the club's nickname superimposed at the top of the crest. Hammam funded the transfers of several new players to the club, and new manager <a href="Lennie%20Lawrence">Lennie Lawrence</a> guided Cardiff to promotion when they won the Second Division play-off in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2003</a> against <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>. Substitute <a href="Andy%20Campbell">Andy Campbell</a> came off the bench to score the only goal in extra time and ensure Cardiff's return to Division One after an 18-year absence.
The club experienced increasing financial difficulties over the next few years and plans for a new stadium failed to gain approval from <a href="Cardiff%20Council">Cardiff Council</a> because of concerns over financial security in 2006. Hammam then agreed to a takeover by a consortium led by new chairman <a href="Peter%20Ridsdale">Peter Ridsdale</a> and the lead developer of the new stadium, Paul Guy. During the 2007–08 season, Cardiff reached the semi-final of the FA Cup for the first time in 81 years after beating Middlesbrough 2–0 on 9March 2008. After coming through their semi-final against <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> with a 1–0 win at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> on 6 April with a goal from <a href="Joe%20Ledley">Joe Ledley</a>, they eventually lost 1–0 to <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> in the final, thanks to a goal from Nwankwo Kanu in the 37th minute. 
In May 2010, <a href="Chan%20Tien%20Ghee">Datuk Chan Tien Ghee</a> took over as club chairman following a takeover bid by a Malaysian consortium; <a href="Vincent%20Tan">Vincent Tan</a> also invested and joined the board. Tan later became the Cardiff's majority shareholder after buying out several other directors and acquired around 82% of the club's shares. In 2011, the club appointed <a href="Malky%20Mackay">Malky Mackay</a> as manager. He took the side to the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> final for the first time in the club's history during his first season. The following season, Cardiff won the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Football%20League%20Championship">2012–13 Championship</a> title and with it gained promotion to the top tier of English football for the first time after 52 years. On 18 August 2013, Cardiff played their first ever away Premier League match against <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>, losing 2–0. Cardiff won only three games in the first half of the season and, on 27 December 2013, Mackay was sacked by Vincent Tan and replaced by <a href="Ole%20Gunnar%20Solskj%C3%A6r">Ole Gunnar Solskjær</a>. Despite the change in management, Cardiff were relegated to the Championship after a single season following a 3–0 away defeat to <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. Solskjær himself was sacked on 18 September 2014 after a disappointing start to the following Championship season, and replaced by <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a> manager <a href="Russell%20Slade">Russell Slade</a>.
In October 2016, <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a> was appointed first team manager of Cardiff. Warnock took over the team with Cardiff second from the bottom of the table after two wins from eleven games, and guided the side to a 12th-placed finish after a good run of form. The start of the 2017–18 season saw Cardiff break a club record by winning their opening three league games of a season, the first time in the club's 107-year professional history. They proceeded to clinch promotion to the Premier League after <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20EFL%20Championship">finishing second in the table</a>. However, they were relegated back to the Championship after a <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Premier%20League">single season</a>.
Warnock resigned as manager in November 2019 following a poor start to the season and was replaced by <a href="Neil%20Harris%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201977%29">Neil Harris</a>. Harris guided Cardiff to a 5th-placed finish before suffering defeat in the Championship playoff semi-final. After a run of six straight defeats, Harris was sacked on 21 January 2021, beginning a chain of short-term hirings. His replacement, <a href="Mick%20McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a>, was appointed the following day, but was relieved of his duties less than a year later with the side 2 points above relegation. The club's under–23 manager <a href="Steve%20Morison">Steve Morison</a> was appointed as caretaker manager before signing an 18-month contract after guiding the Bluebirds to safety. Morrison was sacked in September 2022 and replaced by <a href="Mark%20Hudson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201982%29">Mark Hudson</a>, who lasted only 4 months in the role before he too was dismissed in January 2023.
In December 2022, Cardiff City were issued a transfer embargo by <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>, which was lifted in January 2023. The club are also appealing against an embargo from the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> which prevents them paying fees for players until May 2024.
In March 2023, Cardiff City reported an operating loss of £29 million for the 2021–22 season.
Support.
Cardiff has a large catchment area from which to draw its supporter base. With only two professional teams (Swansea City and <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a>) sharing the South Wales region, the club enjoys considerable support from both the city of Cardiff and the surrounding <a href="South%20Wales%20Valleys">South Wales Valleys</a>. As a Welsh club playing in the English football league system, national identity is believed to be a major factor in fan support, and some of the club's matches are considered to be Welsh cross-border rivalries with England. During the 1980s, as the club struggled in the lower divisions of English football, crowds dropped to an average of 3,000 per match. An increase in the club's fortunes saw a steady improvement in crowd numbers. The average attendance at home matches rose from 3,594 to 12,522 between 1997 and 2002. Promotion to the second tier in 2003 brought further increases in numbers. The opening of the Cardiff City Stadium led to average attendances reaching 20,000 fans, culminating with highs of between 28,000 and 31,000 during two seasons in the Premier League. Despite this increase, the club has often been regarded as attracting fewer spectators than similarly placed teams. This has been attributed to several factors such as the club's controversial change to red shirts between 2012 and 2015—some supporters being perceived as <a href="Fan%20loyalty">fairweather fans</a>, and a lack of atmosphere.
Welsh national identity also contributes to the supporter culture of the club. "<a href="Men%20of%20Harlech">Men of Harlech</a>", a song largely made famous by the 1964 film "<a href="Zulu%20%281964%20film%29">Zulu</a>", which depicted a battle involving a Welsh regiment, and "I'll Be There", a take on a miner's song that was popular during the <a href="1926%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20strike">1926 United Kingdom general strike</a>, are both frequently sung before and during matches. <a href="The%20Ayatollah%20%28football%20celebration%29">The Ayatollah</a>, an act involving raising both arms up and down above the head in a patting motion, has become synonymous with the club and its supporters as a celebratory gesture since its adoption in the early 1990s. The action has become popular with Cardiff fans outside football to show support for the club with boxer <a href="Nathan%20Cleverly">Nathan Cleverly</a>, Olympic swimmer <a href="David%20Davies%20%28swimmer%29">David Davies</a> and rugby player <a href="Gareth%20Thomas%20%28rugby%29">Gareth Thomas</a> all having performed the action at some points of their careers.
Rivalry.
Known as the <a href="South%20Wales%20derby">South Wales derby</a>, Cardiff City's most significant rivalry is with nearby neighbours <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a>, and over 100 games have been played in all competitions between the sides. Swansea's first competitive match following their founding in 1912 was against Cardiff in the Southern Football League. The rivalry had been relatively friendly until the 1970s and 1980s. Economic issues, such as the <a href="UK%20miners%27%20strike%20%281984%E2%80%9385%29">UK miners' strike</a>, rivalry between the two cities and an increase in <a href="football%20hooliganism">football hooliganism</a> led to numerous violent clashes between fans at the matches. One game in 1993 was dubbed "The Battle of Ninian Park" for its particularly severe violence and resulted in away fans being banned from attending any matches between the sides for four years. Cardiff player <a href="Jason%20Perry%20%28footballer%29">Jason Perry</a> described the period as "the dark, dark days of the derby". When the ban was dropped, "bubble trips" were introduced for away fans who could only attend matches via police-escorted convoys to and from the stadium.
Further political divide between the two cities was caused by the <a href="1997%20Welsh%20devolution%20referendum">Welsh devolution referendum in 1997</a> when Cardiff was chosen as the site for the newly created <a href="Senedd">Senedd</a>, despite the majority of the city voting against devolution. Swansea, which largely voted in favour of devolution, received funding for a <a href="Wales%20National%20Pool">national swimming pool</a> instead. <a href="Alan%20Curtis%20%28footballer%29">Alan Curtis</a>, who played for both sides, commented, "I think Cardiff has always been perceived [...] to receive whatever funding is going around. It seems to me that everything gets channelled in that direction".
Further afield, the club has a rivalry with <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a>, known as the <a href="Severnside%20derby">Severnside derby</a>, and to a lesser extent, <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>. There is also a lesser rivalry with Welsh neighbours <a href="Newport%20County%20F.C.">Newport County</a> due to the proximity of the two Welsh cities; they have rarely played against each other since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total, they have only ever played 20 Football League games against each other. A survey by <a href="Football%20Fans%20Census">Football Fans Census</a> in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City, and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> matching Newport in third.
In the 1980s, a hooligan group known as the <a href="Soul%20Crew">Soul Crew</a> emerged from within the club's fanbase. The group became notorious for their violent clashes with rival supporters and brawls between sets of supporters at football matches and other events.
Stadium.
Ninian Park.
Cardiff's first ground was at Sophia Gardens recreational park, where the team played from their founding in 1899 until 1910. With increasing support for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on Sloper Road. The land was a former rubbish tip and required extensive work to get a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers, the work was completed. The original intention was to name the ground Sloper Park, but Ninian Park was chosen instead after <a href="Lord%20Ninian%20Crichton-Stuart">Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart</a>, who was a driving force behind the ground's construction. The ground hosted its first match on 1September 1910 with a friendly against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>; Lord Crichton-Stuart ceremonially kicked off the game.
The stadium was built with one stand. A second, which replaced an earth embankment and could hold 18,000 people, was opened in 1928. It hosted its first international match in March 1911 with a Welsh match against <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a>. Towards the end of its lifespan, the ground was replaced for international fixtures by <a href="Cardiff%20Arms%20Park">Cardiff Arms Park</a> as doubts mounted over the safety of the aging ground. The club's record attendance in the ground is 57,893 which was achieved during a league match against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. The scaling down of grounds throughout the 1970s and 1980s due to safety fears, which saw the ground capacity fall to 22,000, meant that the record stood until the ground's closure. In its final years of use, the club was forced to seek special dispensation from authorities to keep the remaining standing areas of the ground open beyond the three-year period given to clubs at Championship level or above to remove them.
Cardiff City Stadium.
In June 2009, the club completed construction of a 26,828-seat stadium on the site of the now-demolished old <a href="Cardiff%20Athletics%20Stadium">Cardiff Athletics Stadium</a> at a cost of £48 million. The ground was named the "Cardiff City Stadium". Three of the four stands retained the names used at Ninian Park—the Grange End, the Canton Stand and the Grandstand—and the fourth stand was named the Ninian Stand. The ground's naming rights were expected to be sold, the club hoping to generate up to £9 million income; they remain unsold. Although a pre-season friendly against <a href="Chasetown%20F.C.">Chasetown</a> was played at the ground with limited capacity to test safety features, the stadium was officially opened with a friendly against Scottish side <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> on 22 July 2009. The first competitive match played at the ground was on 8August 2009, the opening day of the 2009–10 season, as Cardiff won 4–0 over <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a>. When it opened, the <a href="Cardiff%20Blues">Cardiff Blues</a> rugby union club left their Cardiff Arms Park home to share the new stadium with Cardiff City. The move proved unpopular among fans of the rugby club, which returned to Cardiff Arms Park in 2012.
A few years after the stadium was built, plans to upgrade and expand the stadium were initiated. The expansion plans were completed in August 2014, and the seating capacity was raised to 33,316. In March 2015, it was announced that the Ninian Stand extension was to be shut for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Cardiff%20City%20F.C.%20season">2015–16</a> season due to poor ticket sales, dropping the capacity to 27,978. It was reopened the following year due to an increase in demand.
In February 2023, the stadium was awarded the Level Playing Field's Centre of Excellence Award in recognition of its accessible facilities and services.
Colours, kit and crest.
Colours.
When Riverside A.F.C. was formed in 1899, the club used a chocolate-brown and amber checkered shirt. Following the club's name change to Cardiff City in 1908, they adopted a blue shirt and white or blue shorts and socks, although for the first nine years black socks were used. Kit changes over the club's history have included all blue kits, the introduction of a yellow vertical stripe during the 1970s, and alternating blue stripes.
In 2012, Cardiff controversially changed their home kit colours from the traditional blue, white and yellow to red and black, the first time the club had not worn blue as its primary colour since 1908. The crest was also changed to one in which the <a href="Welsh%20Dragon">Welsh Dragon</a> was more prominent than the traditional bluebird. These changes were made to "appeal in 'international markets as part of a "major investment plan" unveiled by chairman Vincent Tan. The rebranding provoked strong opposition from the fans, who organised protest marches and demonstrations to voice their displeasure at the changes. Despite Tan previously stating that the club would only return to wearing blue if another owner was found, on 9January 2015, after three seasons playing in the red kit, the club reverted their home kit back to blue with a red away kit in a bid to "unite" the club.
Crest history.
From 1908 Cardiff played in unadorned shirts. This changed in 1959 when they played in shirts with a simple crest featuring an image of a <a href="bluebird">bluebird</a>. The following season their shirts were plain and unadorned and remained so until 1965 when they played in shirts with the word "Bluebirds" embroidered. A new crest, similar to the one used previously, and again featuring a bluebird, was introduced in 1969. Variations of this crest have been used over the years. In the 1980s, extra features including words and motifs were added. A major change was made in 2012, when owner Vincent Tan attempted to rebrand the club to expand its appeal outside Wales. This change gave large prominence to the Welsh Dragon, reducing the bluebird to a minor feature. In March 2015, Cardiff announced a new crest which would once again feature the Bluebird predominantly with a <a href="Chinese%20dragon">Chinese dragon</a> replacing the standard Welsh dragon.
Players.

Portsmouth F.C.

Portsmouth Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, <a href="England">England</a>. The team competes in the , the third level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. They are also known as Pompey, a local nickname used by both <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">His Majesty's Naval Base, Portsmouth</a> and the city of Portsmouth.
Founded on 5 April 1898, Portsmouth began their <a href="History%20of%20Portsmouth%20F.C.">early history</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern</a> and <a href="Western%20Football%20League">Western</a> leagues, before being elected into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> in 1920. Portsmouth won two promotions in 1924 and 1927 to reach the First Division, becoming the first football club south of London to do so.
After finishing runners-up in two <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> finals in <a href="1929%20FA%20Cup%20final">1929</a> and <a href="1934%20FA%20Cup%20final">1934</a>, Portsmouth won for the first time in <a href="1939%20FA%20Cup%20final">1939</a>. Portsmouth won the top-flight <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> titles twice in successive 1948–49 and 1949–50 seasons. However, their 32 consecutive years in the First Division ended with relegation in 1959 and was followed by a further relegation in 1961.
In 1978, Portsmouth were relegated to the fourth tier for the first time before earning three promotions in 1980, 1983 and 1987. After a brief spell in the top-flight, Portsmouth would remain in the second tier from 1988 until 2003. After winning promotion, they spent seven years in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> and won the FA Cup for a second time in <a href="2008%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2008</a>.
Relegation from the Premier League in 2009–10 signalled the beginning of a difficult period where the club entered financial administration twice and were relegated three times. After the club was purchased by the <a href="Pompey%20Supporters%20Trust">Pompey Supporters Trust</a> in 2013, Pompey would begin to recover financially as well as winning the <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> title in 2016–17.
Portsmouth are one of only five English football clubs to have been champions of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">all four tiers of the professional English football pyramid</a>. Portsmouth's arch-rivals are <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>, a rivalry based in part on geographic proximity and both cities' respective maritime histories.
History.
1898–1920: founding of Portsmouth F.C. and early years.
Portsmouth F.C. were formed on 5 April 1898, at 12 High Street, <a href="Old%20Portsmouth">Old Portsmouth</a>, as "The Portsmouth Football and Athletic Company", with John Brickwood as chairman. Although the founding of Portsmouth F.C. had been agreed on 5 April 1898, a football ground or a team of players did not exist until 1899. 
In 1899, work began on developing a plot of former agricultural land near Goldsmith Avenue, <a href="Milton%2C%20Portsmouth">Milton, Portsmouth</a> into a new football ground, bought in 1898 from the local Goldsmith farming family. The new football ground was to be named <a href="Fratton%20Park">Fratton Park</a> after the nearby and convenient <a href="Fratton%20railway%20station">Fratton railway station</a>. <a href="Frank%20Brettell">Frank Brettell</a> was announced as Portsmouth Football Club's first manager-secretary in February 1899, A bold and ambitious application for Portsmouth's direct entry into the Southern League First Division, without the usual probationary period in the lower divisions, was accepted, and the club joined the <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20Southern%20Football%20League%23Division%20One">Southern Football League Division One</a> for the 1899–1900 season. The Southern League were very keen to see a professional team from Portsmouth join the Southern League. 
On 6 September 1899, the first-ever home match at Fratton Park was played; a friendly against local team <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>, which Portsmouth won 2–0. Portsmouth's first competitive Southern League home match followed on 9 September, a 2–0 win against <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>. Portsmouth's first 1899–1900 season in the Southern Football League Division One was successful, with the club winning 20 out of 28 league matches, earning them the runner-up spot in the table behind champions, <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>.
In their second <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20Southern%20Football%20League%23Division%20One">1900–01 Southern Football League Division One</a> season, Portsmouth finished in third place and joined the <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20Western%20Football%20League">1900–01 Western Football League</a>, where they finished as Division One champions. Portsmouth won the <a href="1901%E2%80%9302%20Southern%20Football%20League">1901–02 Southern Football League</a> championship title but were not promoted. In the <a href="1901%E2%80%9302%20Western%20Football%20League">1901–02 Western Football League</a>, Portsmouth also won the Division One championship for a second consecutive season. In the <a href="1902%E2%80%9303%20Western%20Football%20League">1902–03 Western Football League</a>, Portsmouth won the Division One championship for a third consecutive season. 
In the <a href="1906%E2%80%9307%20Western%20Football%20League">1906–07 Western Football League</a>, the top Division One was split into equal 'A' and 'B' sections, with a play-off between the two section winners to decide a Division One champion. The <a href="1906%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">1906–07 season</a> was highlighted by the visit of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> to Fratton Park in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, which generated a record attendance of 24,329. A 2–2 draw meant a replay in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, where Portsmouth recorded a famous 2–1 win.
In their last <a href="1908%E2%80%9309%20Western%20Football%20League">Western Football League</a> appearance, Portsmouth finished in fourth position of the 'B' section of Division One. At the end of the season, all fourteen members of the split 'A' and 'B' sections of Division One resigned from the Western Football League. Portsmouth ended their season in sixth place before the <a href="1910%E2%80%9311%20Southern%20Football%20League">following</a> season saw the team relegated. A severe financial crisis struck between seasons and a public appeal for funds in May 1911 kept the club afloat.
With the recruitment of manager <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28football%20manager%29">Robert Brown</a> from <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday">Sheffield Wednesday</a> the team finished second place in the <a href="1911%E2%80%9312%20Southern%20Football%20League">1911–12 Southern Football League</a> Division Two and were promoted as runners-up. However, the club's finances were in trouble again, with losses and debts increasing to £10,000. A shareholders meeting was called on 8 May 1912, where <a href="George%20Lewin%20Oliver">George Lewin Oliver</a>, one of the original founders and directors, proposed that ""The Portsmouth Football and Athletic Company" should be wound up and replaced with a more business orientated company. The original company was then liquidated to remove the debt and on 27 July 1912, the "Portsmouth Football Company Ltd"" was formed as the new parent company of Portsmouth F.C., with substantial financial guarantees given by the board of directors. The original 1898 founding director George Lewin Oliver became the new Portsmouth F.C. chairman.
For the new <a href="1912%E2%80%9313%20Southern%20Football%20League">1912–13 Southern Football League</a> season back in Division One, Portsmouth, now under new ownership, wore new home colours of blue shirts, white shorts and black stockings. Portsmouth finished the season in 11th position. Football was suspended during the First World War. Many with connections to Portsmouth F.C. joined the "Pompey Pals Battalions", which formed parts of the <a href="Hampshire%20Regiment">Hampshire Regiment</a>, many never returned home. In 1915, the Fratton End terrace was upgraded to accommodate 8,000 standing supporters and covered with a roof for the first time. Following the resumption of matches in the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Southern%20Football%20League">1919–20 season</a>, Portsmouth won the Southern League championship for the second time. Portsmouth were then elected to the Football League Third Division as founder members. 
1920–1939: establishment in Football League, FA Cup triumph.
Competing in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Football League Third Division</a>, Portsmouth claimed the title in the <a href="1923%E2%80%9324%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">1923–24 season</a>. Debuting in the second division for the <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">first time</a>, they finished in fourth place. Portsmouth won promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> by finishing runners-up in the <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">1926–27 season</a> and in the process, recording their club record win in a 9–1 victory over <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a>. 
Portsmouth's debut season in the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20Football%20League">1927–28 First Division</a> was a struggle, finishing one point and one place above relegation. The next 1928–29 season in the First Division, Portsmouth continued to falter, losing 10–0 away at <a href="Filbert%20Street">Filbert Street</a> to Leicester City, the club's record away defeat. Despite their failings in the league, Portsmouth reach the <a href="1929%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> for the first time, which they lost to <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. Portsmouth managed to survive relegation, finishing one place above relegation.
From 1929 to 1934, Portsmouth had become a regular top-half table finisher in the First Division. The <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34 season</a> saw Portsmouth again reach the FA Cup final for a second time but lost to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Halfway through the 1934–35 season, the original 1898 founding director and later Portsmouth chairman, George Lewin Oliver died. The ground's capacity was extended to more than 58,000. Having established themselves in the top flight, the <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20in%20English%20football">1938–39 season</a> saw Portsmouth reach the <a href="1939%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a>. This was indeed third time lucky, as Portsmouth managed to defeat favourites <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> 4–1. <a href="Bert%20Barlow">Bert Barlow</a> and <a href="John%20Anderson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201915%29">John 'Jock' Anderson</a> scored, whilst <a href="Cliff%20Parker%20%28footballer%29">Cliff Parker</a> scored twice (third and fourth goals). The start of World War II in 1939 resulted in the suspension of the FA Cup competition for the duration, so Portsmouth held the trophy until it resumed in 1945-1946. 
The new <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20in%20English%20football">1939–40 season</a> was cut short with the start of World War Two. However, football competitions did take place during the war, with the Football League being split into ten regional mini leagues, with Portsmouth in <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20in%20English%20football">'League South'</a> along with an annual national cup competition, the <a href="Football%20League%20War%20Cup">Football League War Cup</a>. In 1942, Portsmouth reached the <a href="London%20War%20Cup">London War Cup</a> final. The London War Cup competition required Portsmouth, the current FA Cup champions, to secede from the Football Association to enter. Portsmouth progressed to the 1942 London War Cup final at Wembley Stadium, but were beaten by <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>. 
During his wartime visits to Portsmouth, <a href="Field%20Marshal%20Montgomery">Field Marshal Montgomery</a> became interested in Portsmouth Football Club and was made honorary President of Portsmouth F.C. in 1944 (until 1961). The end of World War II in 1945 resulted in Portsmouth having held the FA Cup trophy for the longest uninterrupted period of seven years. Manager Jack Tinn was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' during part of the war. As the navy city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for German Luftwaffe bombing, the FA Cup trophy was routinely moved around the city of Portsmouth for its protection.
1946–1959: post-war years, champions of England.
FA Cup competition was resumed for the <a href="1945%E2%80%9346%20in%20English%20football">1945–46 season</a>, but the resumption of the Football League had to wait one more year. The Football League finally resumed in <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Football%20League">1946–47</a>. Portsmouth had capitalised on the footballers called up to serve in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines in the war years and recruited some of them. 
In the <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20Football%20League">1948–49 season</a>, Bob Jackson's Portsmouth side were tipped to be the first team of the 20th century to win a historic Football League and FA Cup "<a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a>" which helped attract average home attendances of 36,000 supporters, and a record attendance of 51,385 in an FA Cup quarter-final match against Derby County before a defeat in the semi-final. Portsmouth however, did win the First Division title. Bob Jackson's Portsmouth side beat <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> 5–1 on the last day of the following <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20Football%20League">1949–50 season</a>, winning the Football League title again for a second consecutive season – on goal average – as both Portsmouth and runners up <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> finished the season with the same points tally. In the following <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1950–51 season</a>, Portsmouth finished in 7th position. <a href="Eddie%20Lever">Eddie Lever</a> took over at Pompey in 1952 after championship-winning manager Bob Jackson joined <a href="Hull%20City">Hull City</a>. After narrowly avoiding relegation in previous seasons, Portsmouth finished bottom of the First Division at the end of the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Football%20League">1958–59 season</a>, ending their 32-year stay in the First Division
1959–1979: decline and relegation to the Fourth Division.
After another poor season, they escaped a further relegation to the Third Division only by 2 points and finishing only one place above the relegation zone. In the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Football%20League">1960–61 season</a> Portsmouth finished second-to-last place in the Second Division relegation zone and were relegated once again to the Third Division. Under the guidance of <a href="George%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201915%29">George Smith</a>, Portsmouth were promoted back to the Second Division at the first time of asking, winning the Third Division title. 
Despite limited financial means, manager George Smith maintained Portsmouth's Second Division status throughout the rest of the 1960s until Smith was replaced by <a href="Ron%20Tindall">Ron Tindall</a> in April 1970. The cash injection that accompanied the arrival of John Deacon as chairman in 1972 failed to improve Portsmouth's Second Division position. With Deacon unable to continue bankrolling the club on the same scale, Portsmouth finished bottom of the Second Division in the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">1975–76 season</a> and were relegated down to the Third Division.
In November of the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League">1976–77 Third Division season</a>, the club found itself needing to raise <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>25,000 to pay off debts and so avoid bankruptcy. With players having to be sold to ease the club's financial situation, and no money available for replacements, Portsmouth were forced to rely on inexperienced young players. They ended the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League">1976–77 season</a> only one place and one point above the Third Division's relegation zone. They were relegated at the end of the new 1977–78 season, finishing in bottom place. In the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Football%20League">1978–79 Fourth Division season</a>, Portsmouth finished in 7th position. Jimmy Dickinson suffered a heart attack near the end of the season and after the season in May 1979, was replaced by <a href="Frank%20Burrows">Frank Burrows</a>.
1979–1987: return to the First Division.
Under Frank Burrows new management, Portsmouth gained promotion back to the Third Division after finishing in 4th place in the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">1979–80 season</a>. Portsmouth would take three seasons before in 1983, Portsmouth claimed their <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division championship title</a>, gaining promotion back into the Second Division.
In the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">1983–84 Second Division season</a>, Portsmouth finished sixteenth place in the table. After the season, Bobby Campbell was replaced by former England <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> winner, <a href="Alan%20Ball%20Jr.">Alan Ball</a> on 11 May 1984. Under Ball, Portsmouth's results markedly improved and they narrowly missed winning promotion to the First Division in the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">1984–85 season</a>. In Ball's third season as Portsmouth manager in the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">1986–87 Second Division season</a>, Portsmouth finished as runners-up behind Derby County, gaining promotion back to the First Division for the first time since the 1958–59 season. 
By the middle of the new <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1987–88 First Division season</a>, the club was again in financial trouble with the ground in a poor condition. Portsmouth were relegated straight back down to the Second Division. The summer of 1988 saw chairman John Deacon sell the club to London-based businessman and former <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> chairman, <a href="Jim%20Gregory%20%28football%20chairman%29">Jim Gregory</a>. 
1988–2003: second tier.
Halfway through the season, Alan Ball was sacked on 17 January 1989 and replaced by <a href="John%20Gregory%20%28footballer%29">John Gregory</a>. The club's parent company had a name change from 'Portsmouth Football Company Limited' to 'Portsmouth Football Club Limited' on 23 January 1989. Portsmouth ended the season only two places above the relegation zone. 
<a href="Jim%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201940%29">Jim Smith</a>'s arrival as manager at the start of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">1991–92 season</a> sparked a revival in the team's fortunes and that year Portsmouth reached the semi-finals of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, but lost the replay to Liverpool on penalties. The <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Football%20League">1992–93 Football League</a> season saw a major restructuring of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football "pyramid" system</a>, with the new <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a> becoming the new first tier and the First Division becoming the second tier. Therefore, Portsmouth played in the new "First Division" but missed out on automatic promotion by virtue of scoring only one fewer goal than second-placed <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>. In the subsequent promotion play-offs, Portsmouth lost 3–2 on aggregate to Leicester City.
In <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">1994–95</a>, Jim Smith was sacked on 1 February 1995 and was replaced by <a href="Terry%20Fenwick">Terry Fenwick</a>, who guided them to safety with 4 wins in their final 6 league games. In the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">1995–96 season</a>, relegation to the Second Division was avoided on the last day of the season (on goal difference) when Portsmouth won away at <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> while other results went the club's way. Terry Venables took over as chairman in February 1997 after buying a 51 per cent controlling share in the club for £1. Two-thirds of the way through the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">1997–98 season</a>, Venables and manager Terry Fenwick left the club, with Portsmouth on the bottom of the table, and Venables selling his shareholding back to Martin Gregory, son of former chairman Jim Gregory. Alan Ball then returned as manager for the second time on 26 January 1998. Relegation to the third tier was avoided on the last day of the season – by 1 point.
Portsmouth's centenary season, <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">1998–99</a>, saw a financial crisis hit the club, and in December 1998 Portsmouth went into <a href="Administration%20%28football%29">financial administration</a>. Serbian-born US businessman <a href="Milan%20Mandari%C4%87">Milan Mandarić</a> was persuaded by his friend <a href="George%20Best">George Best</a> to invest in an English football club; Mandaric decided to buy Portsmouth in May 1999. Alan Ball was sacked on 9 December 1999 during the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000</a> season with the club near the bottom of the table. <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a> steered the club to safety. Portsmouth escaped relegation on the last day of the 2000–01 season when they won their final game and <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> lost theirs, keeping Portsmouth up at their expense. A week before the new season began, 25-year-old Portsmouth goalkeeper <a href="Aaron%20Flahavan">Aaron Flahavan</a> was killed in a car crash on 5 August 2001 with the club retiring his number 1 shirt for the season. Harry Redknapp became manager in 2002. After a 17th place finish, he led Pompey to the First Division title in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2002–03</a>, after an absence of fifteen seasons from the first tier.
2003–2010: Premier League.
In Portsmouth's Premiership debut season in 2003–04, the partnership of Harry Redknapp and Jim Smith resulted in a 13th place final position at the end of the season. Almost halfway through the following 2004–05 season in the Premiership, Harry Redknapp unexpectedly walked out on Portsmouth on 24 November 2004 after a row with chairman Milan Mandarić over the appointment of new Director of Football <a href="Velimir%20Zajec">Velimir Zajec</a> at the club and later joined Southampton. Zajec then replaced Redknapp as Portsmouth manager, but in April 2005, Zajec was replaced by Frenchman <a href="Alain%20Perrin">Alain Perrin</a>. Perrin managed to secure Portsmouth's Premiership status with a few games of the season left.
During the 2005–06 season, Alain Perrin was sacked with Harry Redknapp then making a surprise return to manage Portsmouth again after leaving relegated Southampton. In January 2006, Portsmouth were sold by Milan Mandarić and bought by businessman <a href="Alexandre%20Gaydamak">Alexandre Gaydamak</a>. The club survived their third season in the Premier League one place above the relegation zone in 17th position. With large amounts of money available for Redknapp to make record signings, the club finished the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2006–07 season</a> in the top half of the table for the first time since their promotion, in ninth position.
The following <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>, Portsmouth finished eighth in the Premier League and reached the <a href="2008%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a> for the first time since 1939 after defeating Championship side <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Brom</a> in the semi-finals. On 17 May 2008, Portsmouth played <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> in the <a href="2008%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> at Wembley Stadium. Portsmouth won 1–0, with <a href="Nwankwo%20Kanu">Nwankwo Kanu</a> scoring the only goal. 
The FA Cup win had also earned Portsmouth a place in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">2008–09 UEFA Cup</a>, the club's first time playing European football. On 25 October 2008, Redknapp left Portsmouth for a second time, leaving his assistant <a href="Tony%20Adams">Tony Adams</a> to be promoted to the managerial role. On 27 November 2008, Portsmouth drew 2–2 with <a href="A.C.%20Milan">AC Milan</a>, going 2–0 up, but conceding two goals later in the game. Adams was dismissed in February 2009. Youth team coach <a href="Paul%20Hart">Paul Hart</a> took over as manager until the end of the season, eventually finishing in 14th place. On 26 May, Portsmouth accepted a bid from <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">Emirati</a> businessman <a href="Sulaiman%20Al%20Fahim">Sulaiman Al Fahim</a> to purchase the club.
Because of the financial problems suffered by the club, Portsmouth were forced to sell several of their top players and high earners, including <a href="Peter%20Crouch">Peter Crouch</a>, <a href="Sylvain%20Distin">Sylvain Distin</a>, <a href="Glen%20Johnson">Glen Johnson</a> and <a href="Niko%20Kranj%C4%8Dar">Niko Kranjčar</a>. On 21 July 2009, Al Fahim was appointed non-executive chairman of Portsmouth. On 19 August 2009, Portsmouth announced on their website that a rival consortium headed by current CEO <a href="Peter%20Storrie">Peter Storrie</a> had also made a bid for the club; unknown at the time, this was backed by <a href="Ali%20al-Faraj">Ali al-Faraj</a>. Despite this, Al Fahim completed the takeover on 26 August 2009; al Faraj moved to review a takeover of West Ham United.
As the early stages of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 season</a> progressed, the finances dried up and the club admitted on 1 October that some of their players and staff had not been paid. On 3 October, media outlets started to report that a deal was nearing completion for Ali al-Faraj to take control of the club. On 5 October, a deal was agreed for al-Faraj and his associates, via <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands">BVI</a>-registered company Falcondrone, to hold a 90% majority holding, with Al-Fahim retaining 10% stake and the title of non-executive chairman for two years. Falcondrone also agreed a deal with Alexandre Gaydamak the right to buy, for £1, Miland Development (2004) Ltd., which owns various strategic pockets of land around the ground, once refinancing was complete. Because of the financial difficulties, the Premier League placed the club under a transfer embargo.
Avram Grant took over at Portsmouth on 26 November 2009, following the dismissal of Hart. <a href="HM%20Revenue%20and%20Customs">HM Revenue and Customs</a> (HMRC) filed a winding-up petition against Portsmouth at the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court of Justice</a> on 23 December 2009. In March 2010, this winding-up petition was dropped, leaving Portsmouth with a nine-point penalty for entering administration.
2010–2017: administration, FA Cup final appearance and relegations.
During the 2009–10 season, it had become apparent to the club's new owner <a href="Balram%20Chainrai">Balram Chainrai</a> that Portsmouth were approximately £135 million in debt so to protect the club from liquidation, Chainrai placed the club into administration on 26 February 2010, and the club appointed Andrew Andronikou, Peter Kubik and Michael Kiely of accountancy firm <a href="UHY%20Hacker%20Young">UHY Hacker Young</a> as administrators. This automatically incurred a nine-point penalty from the Premier League which came into effect on 17 March and consigned the team to almost certain relegation, which was mathematically confirmed on 10 April 2010 after West Ham won. 
Portsmouth won their FA Cup semi-final match against Tottenham 2–0 after extra-time the next day and faced Chelsea in the <a href="2010%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> at Wembley on 15 May 2010 but lost 1–0 to a goal from <a href="Didier%20Drogba">Didier Drogba</a>. Despite being the FA Cup finalists, the club were denied a licence to play European football the following season in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>. On 17 June, the club's creditors voted for a <a href="Trading%20while%20insolvent%20%28UK%29%23Company%20Voluntary%20Arrangement%20%28CVA%29">company voluntary arrangement</a> (CVA), with an 81.3% majority; HMRC, Paul Hart and the agent of Portsmouth midfielder <a href="Tommy%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201980%29">Tommy Smith</a> were the only ones to reject it, but HMRC appealed against the CVA due to the reduction of its considerable debt. On 15 July 2010, HMRC appealed against the proposed CVA on the last day before it would be formally agreed, the case was originally going to take place in October 2010, but after an appeal from the administrators at the club it was set for 3 August at the High Court in London. The case was heard by Mr Justice Mann from 3 to 5 August where, having heard submissions from both sides, he turned down HMRC's appeal on all five counts it had put forward. HMRC decided not to appeal against the verdict, leaving Portsmouth's administrators to formally agree the CVA and bring the club out of administration. On 17 August, Balram Chainrai completed his takeover of the club and passed the owners' and directors' <a href="fit%20and%20proper%20person%20test">fit and proper person test</a>.
On 22 October 2010, Portsmouth issued a statement saying, "It appears likely that the club will now be closed down and liquidated by the administrators," but key creditor Alexandre Gaydamak announced the next day that he had reached an agreement which could save their future. It was revealed just hours later that Portsmouth had finally come out of administration, with Balram Chainrai regaining control of the company. On 1 June 2011, Convers Sports Initiatives (CSI) owned by Russian <a href="Vladimir%20Aleksandrovich%20Antonov">Vladimir Antonov</a> completed its takeover of the club, although an arrest warrant would later be issued for him in November 2011 following allegations of <a href="asset%20stripping">asset stripping</a>. Antonov was subsequently arrested at his offices in London on 24 November and was bailed. He shortly afterwards resigned as chairman of Portsmouth after parent company CSI entered administration. On 24 January 2012, Portsmouth were issued with a winding up petition by HMRC for over £1.6 million in unpaid taxes, which was heard on 20 February. On 17 February 2012, Portsmouth went into administration for the second time in two years, bringing them an automatic 10-point deduction. On 11 April 2012, reports from administrators PKF revealed that Portsmouth owed £58 million with £38 million being owed to UHY Hacker Young, £10.5 million investment made by Vladimir Antonov's CSI remained outstanding, players were due £3.5 million in wages and bonuses for the last two seasons, while £2.3 million was owed to HMRC and, additionally, £3.7 million was owed for general trade. On 21 April, Portsmouth were relegated from the Championship after a 2–1 loss to <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>, the first time in 30 years that the club had played at that level.
Following Pompey's relegation to <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a>, the entire professional playing squad left the club. The team were given a 10-point deduction in December 2012 for their financial issues. On 9 November 2012, Chanrai halted his attempt to buy the club. Six days later, the Pompey Supporters Trust signed a conditional agreement with PFK to buy the club. The club went on a record winless run of 23 matches during the season. On 10 April 2013, a deal with administrators was reached, although the Pompey Supporters' Trust had not yet finalised the purchase. Portsmouth were relegated again at the end of the season. On 19 April 2013, Portsmouth exited administration when the <a href="Pompey%20Supporters%20Trust">Pompey Supporters' Trust</a> (PST) deal to buy the club was completed. 
The <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a> season was also a turbulent one for Pompey with a high turnover of managers. With the club in serious danger of relegation to <a href="Football%20Conference">non-League</a>, <a href="Andy%20Awford">Andy Awford</a> was again made caretaker manager and guided the club away from the drop. In a historic announcement on 29 September 2014, the club was able to declare itself debt-free after paying back all creditors and legacy payments to ex-players. Following an unsuccessful <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2014–15</a> campaign, <a href="Paul%20Cook%20%28footballer%29">Paul Cook</a> was appointed new manager of Portsmouth on 12 May 2015.
Following an unsuccessful play-off attempt in the previous season, Paul Cook's side secured promotion to League One in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20EFL%20League%20Two">2016–17</a> with a 3–1 win away at <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a>. On the final day of the season, Portsmouth reached the top the table for the first time in the season following a 6–1 home win against <a href="Cheltenham%20Town%20F.C.">Cheltenham Town</a> and were crowned champions of League Two. However, Paul Cook resigned on 31 May 2017 to join <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>.
2017–present.
In May 2017, the Pompey Supporters' Trust (PST) voted in favour of a proposed bid by <a href="The%20Tornante%20Company">The Tornante Company</a>, headed by former Disney chief executive <a href="Michael%20Eisner">Michael Eisner</a>, to take over the club which was completed on 3 August 2017. Portsmouth ended their first <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20EFL%20League%20One">season</a> back in League One in 8th position on 66 points, missing out on the play-off places. On 31 March 2019, Portsmouth met <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> in the <a href="2019%20EFL%20Trophy%20final">2019 EFL Trophy final</a> at Wembley Stadium. The match finished 2–2 after extra time, with Pompey winning 5–4 on penalties. Portsmouth finished 4th and qualified for the play-offs but lost 1–0 on aggregate to <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>.
During the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2019–20 season</a>, Portsmouth achieved a winning run of nine consecutive matches in all competitions, setting a new win record for the club since Portsmouth joined the Football League in 1920. Portsmouth were due to return to Wembley Stadium to defend the EFL Trophy as champions against <a href="Salford%20City%20F.C.">Salford City</a> on 5 April 2020, however, the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a> forced the suspension of the season on 13 March. On 9 June 2020, the football clubs of EFL League One (and EFL League Two) voted to end the season early on a points-per-game calculation which meant Pompey finished 5th. This meant a behind closed doors play-off tie against <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a>. After two legs a penalty shoot-out was needed to settle the 2–2 aggregate tie, which Oxford won 5–4.
Portsmouth's fourth-successive season in League One began behind closed doors due to the ongoing pandemic. <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19</a> 'social-distancing' restrictions were partially relaxed in December 2020 when 2,000 Portsmouth fans were permitted to return to Fratton Park on 5 December for a fixture against <a href="Peterborough%20United%20F.C.">Peterborough United</a>. The delayed 2020 EFL Trophy final was eventually played behind closed doors at Wembley Stadium on 13 March 2021, with Portsmouth losing 4–2 on penalties to <a href="Salford%20City%20F.C.">Salford City</a> after a 0–0 draw. Pompey finished just outside the play-off places in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2020–21</a>, <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2021–22</a> and <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Portsmouth%20F.C.%20season">2022–23</a>.
Club identity.
Club badge.
Although Portsmouth F.C. were formed in 1898, the club did not have a club badge until one was introduced for the 1913–14 season. The official Coat of Arms of the <a href="Portsmouth">City of Portsmouth</a> contains an eight pointed gold star and crescent moon on a blue shield, Portsmouth's adoption of the <a href="star%20and%20crescent">star and crescent</a> is said to have come from when <a href="King%20Richard%20I">King Richard I</a> (1157–1189), who granted the city "a crescent of gold on a shade of azure, with a blazing star of eight points" which he had taken from the <a href="Byzantine%20Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a>'s standard of Governor <a href="Isaac%20Komnenos%20of%20Cyprus">Isaac Komnenos</a>, after capturing <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>.
The first 1913 Portsmouth F.C. badge was based on official symbols belonging to the town council of Portsmouth, which featured a golden eight-pointed star and a golden crescent moon. The club's first badge featured a horizontally elongated white crescent moon beneath a white five pointed star, with both symbols positioned in the centre of a blue four pointed shield. Portsmouth town council bestowed the privileged use (but not ownership) of their moon and star motifs to Portsmouth F.C., albeit with some colour and design changes.
Throughout their history Portsmouth F.C. have tried different variations of the badge. After World War II, Portsmouth began using an eight-pointed star to match that used by the city of Portsmouth. In the 1950s and 1960s, the traditional badge was emblazoned on the shirt in white rather than gold but this was due to white being a cheaper alternative to a more expensive gold coloured thread. Between 1980 and 1989, Portsmouth scrapped their traditional star and crescent badge and replaced it with an entirely new design. This badge showed a football in front of an <a href="anchor">anchor</a> (representing the navy) and a <a href="sword">sword</a> (representing the army), with the whole design surrounded by an outer ring of ships rope. An alternative version included a circular version of the traditional star and crescent badge in place of the football.
During 1989 and 1993, the sword and anchor badge was dropped replaced with a simpler eight pointed star and crescent moon on a long narrow shield. From 1993 until 1997, the 1989–93 long narrow shield design was replaced by an embroidered badge of the city of Portsmouth Coat of Arms. The 1993–97 city arms badge was replaced in 1997, with an eight pointed gold star and a golden crescent moon on a blue shield edged with a gold outer rim. This new badge coincided with the centennial anniversary in the 1997–98 season.
On 6 May 2008, Portsmouth revealed a new badge with "three points" at the top of the shield were replaced with two straightened angles, with "Portsmouth F.C." written above the star on the shield. The traditional elongated crescent moon was replaced with a new circular one, which closely resembled that on the city's Coat of Arms. The new badge had its debut in the 2008 FA Cup final, in which Portsmouth also wore a new 110th Anniversary all-blue commemorative home strip. As part of the World War I Centennial Commemorations in the 2014–15 season, the club opted to temporarily replace the badge with a more traditional badge. In June 2015, Portsmouth reverted the official club badge back to a traditional design. 
On 4 May 2017, during a meeting between the Tornante Company the Supporters Trust, the prospective new owners identified a long overlooked ownership and copyright issue concerning the traditional Portsmouth badge – Portsmouth Football Club did not legally "own" the symbols on the badge, which had actually only been "on loan" to the club from Portsmouth City Council since 1913. On 15 March 2018, two newly redesigned club badges were finally revealed ahead of the 2018–19 season (one for players' shirts and the other for commercial purposes).
Home colours.
In the 1899–1900 season, Portsmouth's first home colours were salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, matched with white shorts and black socks. The pink shirts gave the early Portsmouth F.C. the alternative second nickname of 'The Shrimps'. The collars and cuffs were the same colour as the Corporation of Portsmouth's public trams, which were painted maroon at the time. These colours lasted until the end of the 1908–09 season. At the start of the 1909–10 season, Portsmouth changed to white shirts with navy blue shorts and navy blue socks.
For the start of the 1912–13 Southern League Division One season, Portsmouth changed their home colours to azure blue shirts, white shorts and black socks. This was to become Portsmouth's home kit colour combination up until the start of the 1933–34 season, when the shirts were changed to a royal blue. These colours remained until the start of the 1947–48 season, when the black socks were changed to red; this coinciding with the club's most successful period and has remained the favoured colours for the majority of the time since. Portsmouth F.C. changed their colour combination several times during the 1966–1976 period, before reverting to the now tradition post-war blue shirts, white shorts and red stockings in 1976. For the club's 110th anniversary season in 2008–09, Portsmouth played in an all blue home kit, which debuted in the previous season's successful 2008 FA Cup final win. Since the 2009–10 season, Portsmouth reverted to the now traditional blue-white-red home kit.
Red socks memorial.
Portsmouth had predominantly worn black socks since their first match in 1899. During the Second World War and post-war periods, the British Army's <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Field Marshal Sir Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery</a> had been based at <a href="Southwick%20House">Southwick House</a>, 5 miles to the north of Portsmouth. Montgomery regularly attended Pompey matches at Fratton Park, becoming the honorary President of Portsmouth Football Club. Following the suggestion by Montgomery, red socks were introduced by the club as a memorial to soldiers lost in wartime as red is the traditional colour of the British Army and also the colour of the <a href="Remembrance%20poppy">Remembrance poppy</a>. This also gave the Portsmouth team a patriotic blue, white and red appearance similar to the United Kingdom's red white and blue <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a>. The new red socks also coincided with Portsmouth's most successful period, so the red socks were retained for good luck.
Away colours.
The most frequent away colours used by Portsmouth have been white shirts with royal or navy blue shorts and either blue or white socks.
Other historic kits.
For the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20FA%20Cup">2008 FA Cup final</a> victory against <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a>, Portsmouth debuted an all blue home kit manufactured by <a href="Canterbury%20of%20New%20Zealand">Canterbury</a> and sponsored by <a href="Oki%20Electric%20Industry">Oki Printing Solutions</a> to commemorate the club's 110th Anniversary year. The all blue home kit was also used throughout the following 2008–09 season.
Portsmouth again reached the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup final</a> in 2010, but were defeated 1–0 by <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. Portsmouth, as the away team, wore a white and maroon kit inspired from elements of the original "Shrimps" era (1899–1909) kit in which maroon collars and cuffs featured on the salmon pink home shirts.

"Pompey" nickname.
The traditional nickname of the Portsmouth Football Club is Pompey, a nickname already long associated with the English city of Portsmouth and its <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Royal Navy base</a>. An exact origin for the "Pompey" nickname has never formally been identified by historians, as many variations and interpretations of the "Pompey" nickname exist.
Ground.
Portsmouth play their home games at <a href="Fratton%20Park">Fratton Park</a>, in the Portsmouth suburb of <a href="Milton%2C%20Portsmouth">Milton</a>. The football ground has been home to the club throughout its entire history. The football ground was formerly the site of a potato field in 1898 when it was purchased by the newly-formed "Portsmouth Football & Athletic Company".
Fratton Park was designed and completed during 1899 by local architect <a href="A.%20E.%20Cogswell">Arthur Cogswell</a>, and was first opened to the public on 15 August 1899. The early Fratton Park of 1899 only had one roofed all-seat stand on the pitch's southern side. The first ever football match to take place at Fratton Park was a friendly against Southampton, played on 6 September 1899, with Portsmouth winning 2–0. The first competitive match at Fratton Park was played three days later on 9 September 1899; a Southern League Division One match against <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>, which Portsmouth also won 2–0. 
In 1905, the club expanded Fratton Park, adding a mock Tudor style club pavilion to the south-west corner in Frogmore Road, a pavilion designed by architect Arthur Cogswell. The pavilion originally featured a tall octagonal clock tower spire on its north-east corner, with an upper viewing gallery built beneath it giving an unobscured view over the entire Fratton Park pitch. In addition, two new solid earthbank terraces, topped with cinders and wooden planking were built behind the two goal ends. They were initially known as the "Fratton Railway End" and "Milton End" (or "Spion Kop") and were built behind the west and east end goal lines respectively. 
The pavilion's clock tower was demolished in the 1920s as the South Stand was partially built into the pavilion's footprint and still contains most of the pavilion's original east side within it. Ten years later in 1935, Archibald Leitch also designed a larger North Stand for Fratton Park. Fratton Park reached its current all-time ground attendance record of 51,385 supporters on 26 February 1949, for an FA Cup sixth-round match, a 2–1 win against Derby County. The Fratton Railway End was demolished in 1956 and replaced by a new prefabricated concrete and steel stand, simply known as "The Fratton End". Fratton Park became an all seated football ground in 1996, which greatly reduced Fratton Park's previous maximum capacity. In 1997, a new Fratton End was opened in October 1997. Plans for relocation were first mooted in the early 1990s, but due to various objections and financial obstacles, the club has continued to play at Fratton Park.
Rivalries and supporters.
Portsmouth's main rivals are <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>, who are 19.8 miles (31.8 km) away. The <a href="South%20Coast%20Derby">South Coast Derby</a> is one of the less frequently played rivalries within English football due to the clubs being in different divisions; however this usually adds to the ferocity of the fixture.
Prior to the mid/late 1960s, rivalry between Portsmouth and Southampton was largely non-existent, as a consequence of their disparity in league status. This <a href="Local%20derby">derby match</a> has been sporadic. Since 1977, the teams have only played league games against each other in four seasons (1987–88, 2003–04, 2004–05 and 2011–12). Including Southern League games, there have been 64 league games between the clubs, but they have also met five times in the FA Cup, and twice in the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> – with Southampton winning both times, including at the most recent match between the two sides, with Portsmouth losing to their rivals 4–0 at <a href="Fratton%20Park">Fratton Park</a> in 2019.
Many Portsmouth supporters commonly use the derogatory nickname Scummer (plural: Scummers) to describe Southampton fans, or collectively Scum to also include their football club, and indeed the city of Southampton itself. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, "Scummers" was a derogatory name with naval origins for pirates or buccaneers, and was first recorded in use in 1585.
Meanwhile, Portsmouth supporters have had the equally derogatory nickname Skate bestowed upon them by Southampton fans as a rebuttal to "Scummer" since the 1987–88 Division One season. This was unofficially chosen by Southampton fans from a list of insults compiled by a Southampton-based supporters fanzine called "The Ugly Inside" in 1988. Ironically, the chosen nickname "Skate" was actually stolen from the civilian population of Portsmouth, who had long used "Skate" as a derogatory insult or nickname for sailors based in Portsmouth Dockyard and other Royal Navy establishments. 
Another rivalry over the years, known as the "Dockyard Derby" by the media, is with <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a>. This rivalry is also known as the Battle of the Ports. In recent seasons the club has also developed a minor rivalry with <a href="Sunderland%20AFC">Sunderland</a>, mainly stemming from the clubs meeting each other 5 times in the 2018–19 season.
'The Pompey Chimes'.
The best-known chant sung by Portsmouth supporters are "The Pompey Chimes". The chant is regarded as football's oldest chant still in use today.
"The Pompey Chimes" were originally called "The Town Hall Chimes", and were created by the supporters of Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) Football Club, a British Army artillery regiment team, who were the most popular and successful amateur football team based in Portsmouth for much of the 1890s. Royal Artillery played their home matches at the <a href="United%20Services%20Recreation%20Ground">United Services Recreation Ground</a> in Burnaby Road, Portsmouth, and were already nicknamed "Pompey" before the founding of Portsmouth F.C. in 1898.
The nearby <a href="Portsmouth%20Guildhall">Portsmouth Town Hall</a>, only 0.3 miles (0.5 km) from Burnaby Road was completed in 1890, and would strike the various <a href="Westminster%20Quarters">Westminster Quarters</a> chimes every quarter hour. Football referees would use the Town Hall's clock bells as a reference to when the football match should end at 4 pm. Just before 4 pm the crowd of supporters would sing in unison with the Town Hall's chimes on the hour to encourage the referee to blow the whistle to signify full-time. The original words to "The Pompey Chimes" (as printed in the 1900–01 Official Handbook of Portsmouth F.C.), were:
<score sound="1"> \relative c' {\set Staff.midiInstrument = #"tubular bells" \time 5/4 \key e \major e4 gis fis b,2 | e4 fis gis e2 | gis4 e fis b,2 | b4 fis' gis e2 | R1*5/4\fermata \bar "||" \clef bass \time 4/4 e,1^"Portsmouth Town Hall Chimes (4pm)" | e1| e1 | e1 |}</score>
"Play up Pompey,"
"Just one more goal!" 
"Make tracks! What ho!"
"Hallo! Hallo!!"
With the demise of Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) F.C. after their expulsion from the 1898–99 <a href="FA%20Amateur%20Cup">FA Amateur Cup</a> for alleged professionalism, many of Royal Artillery's supporters switched their allegiance in 1899 to Portsmouth F.C., taking the "Town Hall Chimes" chant and the "Pompey" nickname from Burnaby Road to <a href="Fratton%20Park">Fratton Park</a>, a distance of 1.8 miles (2.8 km).
The Pompey Chimes are still sung at Fratton Park today, and have evolved to be sung at a quicker tempo, and with a shortened chime style – usually twice:
<score sound="1"> \relative c" {\set Staff.midiInstrument = #"tubular bells" \time 5/4 \key e \major gis4 e fis b,2 | b4 fis' gis e2 | gis4 e fis b,2 | b4 fis' gis e2 |}</score>
"Play up Pompey,"
"Pompey play up!"
"Play up Pompey,"
"Pompey play up!"
It is most common to hear The Chimes sung by Portsmouth supporters as an encouragement to the Portsmouth team, more specifically before the Portsmouth players take set-piece kicks, such as corner-kicks, penalty-kicks or direct free-kicks.

Since the formation of the club in 1892, when <a href="Newcastle%20East%20End%20F.C.">Newcastle East End</a> absorbed the assets of <a href="Newcastle%20West%20End%20F.C.">Newcastle West End</a> to become Newcastle United, the club has played its home matches at <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a>. Located in the centre of Newcastle, it currently has a capacity of 52,305.
The club has been a member of the Premier League for all but three years of the competition's history, spending 91 seasons in the top flight as of May 2023, and has never dropped below English football's second tier since joining the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1893. Newcastle have won four <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">League titles</a>, six <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s and an <a href="FA%20Charity%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a>, as well as the <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1968–69 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20England%20by%20competitive%20honours%20won">ninth-highest total of trophies won by an English club</a>.

Their last major domestic trophy was <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20FA%20Cup">in 1955</a>. More recently the club have been League or FA Cup runners-up on four occasions in the 1990s. Newcastle were relegated in 2009, and again in 2016. The club won promotion at the first time of asking each time, returning to the Premier League, as <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> winners, in 2010 and 2017.

History.
1881–1903: formation and early history.
The first record of football being played on <a href="Tyneside">Tyneside</a> dates from 3 March 1877 at <a href="Northern%20Football%20Club">Elswick Rugby Club</a>. Later that year, Newcastle's first football club, Tyne Association, was formed. The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of <a href="Byker">Byker</a> in November 1881. This team was renamed <a href="Newcastle%20East%20End%20F.C.">Newcastle East End F.C.</a> in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in <a href="Stanley%2C%20County%20Durham">Stanley, County Durham</a>. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, <a href="Newcastle%20West%20End%20F.C.">Newcastle West End F.C.</a> formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886 moved into <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a>. The two clubs became rivals in the <a href="Northern%20Football%20League">Northern League</a>. In 1889, Newcastle East End became a professional team, before becoming a limited company the following March. Newcastle West End, on the other hand, was in serious financial trouble and approached East End with a view to a takeover. Newcastle West End was eventually dissolved, and a number of its players and backroom staff joined Newcastle East End, effectively merging the two clubs, with Newcastle East End taking over the lease on St James' Park in May 1892.
With only one senior club in the city for fans to support, development of the club was much more rapid. Despite being refused entry to the <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League's</a> <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> at the start of the <a href="1892%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1892–93</a> season, they were invited to play in their new <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. However, with no big names playing in the Second Division, they turned down the offer and remained in the Northern League, stating "gates would not meet the heavy expenses incurred for travelling". In a bid to start drawing larger crowds, Newcastle East End decided to adopt a new name in recognition of the merger. Suggested names included 1892 Newcastle, Newcastle Rangers, Newcastle City and City of Newcastle, but Newcastle United was decided upon on 9 December 1892, to signify the unification of the two teams. The name change was accepted by the Football Association on 22 December, but the club was not legally constituted as Newcastle United Football Club Co. Ltd. until 6 September 1895. At the start of the <a href="1893%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1893–94</a> season, Newcastle United were once again refused entry to the First Division and so joined the Second Division, along with <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Woolwich%20Arsenal%20F.C.">Woolwich Arsenal</a>. They played their first competitive match in the division that September against Woolwich Arsenal, with a score of 2–2.
Turnstile numbers were still low, and the club published a statement stating, "The Newcastle public do not deserve to be catered for as far as professional football is concerned". However, eventually figures picked up by <a href="1895%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1895–96</a>, when 14,000 fans watched the team play <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>. That season <a href="Frank%20Watt%20%28football%20manager%29">Frank Watt</a> became secretary of the club, and he was instrumental in promotion to the First Division for the <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1898–99</a> season. However, they lost their first game 4–2 at home to <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and finished their first season in 13th place.
1903–1937: first glory years and war years.
In <a href="1903%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">1903–04</a>, the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their "artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing". Long after his retirement, <a href="Peter%20McWilliam">Peter McWilliam</a>, the team's <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">defender</a> at the time, said, "The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and furthermore, beat them at a trot". Newcastle United went on to win the League on three occasions during the 1900s; <a href="1904%E2%80%9305%20Football%20League">1904–05</a>, <a href="1906%E2%80%9307%20Football%20League">1906–07</a> and <a href="1908%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League">1908–09</a>. In 1904–05, they nearly did the double, losing to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> in the <a href="1905%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1905 FA Cup Final</a>. They were beaten again the following year by <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> in the <a href="1906%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1906 FA Cup Final</a>. They reached the final again in 1908 where they lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers. They finally won the FA Cup in 1910 when they beat <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> in the <a href="1910%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a>. They lost again the following year in the <a href="1911%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> against <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a>.
The team returned to the <a href="1924%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final in 1924</a>, in the second final held at the then new <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. They beat Aston Villa, winning the club's second <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. Three years later, they won the First Division championship a fourth time in <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20Football%20League">1926–27</a>, with <a href="Hughie%20Gallacher">Hughie Gallacher</a>, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the club's history, captaining the team. Other key players in this period were <a href="Neil%20Harris%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201894%29">Neil Harris</a>, <a href="Stan%20Seymour">Stan Seymour</a> and <a href="Frank%20Hudspeth">Frank Hudspeth</a>. In 1930, Newcastle United came close to relegation, and at the end of the season Gallacher left the club for <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, and at the same time <a href="Andy%20Cunningham%20%28footballer%29">Andy Cunningham</a> became the club's first team manager. In <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20Football%20League">1931–32</a>, the club won the <a href="1932%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup</a> a third time. However, a couple of years later, at the end of the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20Football%20League">1933–34 season</a>, the team were relegated to the Second Division after 35 seasons in the top. Cunningham left as manager and <a href="Tom%20Mather">Tom Mather</a> took over.
1937–1969: post-war success.
The club found it difficult to adjust to the Second Division and were nearly further relegated in the <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20Football%20League">1937–38 season</a>, when they were spared on goal average. However, when World War II broke out in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in <a href="Jackie%20Milburn">Jackie Milburn</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Walker%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201923%29">Tommy Walker</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Cowell">Bobby Cowell</a>. They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20Football%20League">1947–48 season</a>. During the 1950s, Newcastle won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> three times in five years, beating <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> in 1951, <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in 1952 and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61 season</a> under the management of <a href="Charlie%20Mitten">Charlie Mitten</a>. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player <a href="Joe%20Harvey">Joe Harvey</a>. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20in%20English%20football">1964–65 season</a> after winning the Second Division title. Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20in%20English%20football">1967–68 season</a> and the following year won the <a href="1969%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup%20Final">1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final</a>, triumphing 6–2 over two legs against Hungary's <a href="%C3%9Ajpest%20FC">Újpest</a> in the final.
1969–1992: bouncing between divisions.
Harvey bought striker <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a> in the summer of 1971, for a club record <a href="transfer%20fee">transfer fee</a> of £180,000 (equivalent to £2,265,000 in 2021). He was an impressive goal scorer, who led United's attack to Wembley in their <a href="1974%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1974 FA Cup Final</a> defeat at the hands of Liverpool. The club also had back to back triumphs in the <a href="Texaco%20Cup">Texaco Cup</a> in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Football%20League">1974</a> and <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Football%20League">1975</a>. Harvey left the club in 1975, with <a href="Gordon%20Lee%20%28footballer%29">Gordon Lee</a> brought in to replace him. Lee took the team to the <a href="1976%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1976 Football League Cup Final</a> against Manchester City, but failed to bring the trophy back to Tyneside. However, he sold Macdonald to Arsenal at the end of the season, a decision of which Macdonald later said "I loved Newcastle, until Gordon Lee took over". Lee left for Everton in 1977, and was replaced by <a href="Richard%20Dinnis">Richard Dinnis</a>.
United dropped once again to the Second Division at the end of the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20in%20English%20football">1977–78 season</a>. Dinnis was replaced by <a href="Bill%20McGarry">Bill McGarry</a>, and then he was replaced by <a href="Arthur%20Cox%20%28footballer%29">Arthur Cox</a>. Cox steered Newcastle back to the First Division at the end of the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20in%20English%20football">1983–84 season</a>, with players such as <a href="Peter%20Beardsley">Peter Beardsley</a>, <a href="Chris%20Waddle">Chris Waddle</a> and ex-<a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> captain <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a> the fulcrum of the team. However, with a lack of funds, Cox left for <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> and Keegan retired. With managers such as <a href="Jack%20Charlton">Jack Charlton</a> and then <a href="Willie%20McFaul">Willie McFaul</a>, Newcastle remained in the top-flight, until key players such as Waddle, Beardsley and <a href="Paul%20Gascoigne">Paul Gascoigne</a> were sold, and the team was relegated once more in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89 season</a>. McFaul left the managerial post, and was replaced by <a href="Jim%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201940%29">Jim Smith</a>. Smith left at the start of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92 season</a> and the board appointed <a href="Osvaldo%20Ardiles">Osvaldo Ardiles</a> his replacement.
<a href="John%20Hall%20%28businessman%29">John Hall</a> became the club's chairman in 1992, and replaced Ardiles with Keegan, who managed to save the team from relegation to the Third Division. Keegan was given more money for players, buying <a href="Rob%20Lee">Rob Lee</a>, <a href="Paul%20Bracewell">Paul Bracewell</a> and <a href="Barry%20Venison">Barry Venison</a>. The club won the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> championship at the end of the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">1992–93 season</a>, earning promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>.
1993–2007: into the Premier League.
At the end of their first year, <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">1993–94 season</a>, back in the top flight they finished in third, their highest league finish since 1927. The attacking philosophy of Keegan led to the team being labelled "The Entertainers" by <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a>.
Keegan took Newcastle to two consecutive runners-up finishes in the league in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96</a> and <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1996–97</a>, coming very close to winning the title in the former season which included a <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%204%E2%80%933%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20%281996%29">4–3 game against Liverpool at Anfield</a> – often considered the greatest game in Premier League history – which ended with a defining image of the Premier League with Keegan slumped over the advertising hoarding. The success of the team was in part due to the attacking talent of players like <a href="David%20Ginola">David Ginola</a>, <a href="Les%20Ferdinand">Les Ferdinand</a> and <a href="Alan%20Shearer">Alan Shearer</a>, who was signed on 30 July 1996 for a then <a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20association%20football%20transfers">world record</a> fee of £15 million.
Keegan left Newcastle in January 1997 and was replaced by <a href="Kenny%20Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a>, however the club endured a largely unsuccessful season with a 13th-place finish in the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20FA%20Premier%20League">1997–98 FA Premier League</a>, failure to progress beyond the group stages of the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1997–98 UEFA Champions League</a> despite beating <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and group winners <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a> at home as well as coming from 2–0 down to draw 2–2 with <a href="Valeriy%20Lobanovskyi">Valeriy Lobanovskyi</a>'s team in Ukraine and defeat in the <a href="1998%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1998 FA Cup Final</a>. Dalglish was replaced as manager early in the following season by <a href="Ruud%20Gullit">Ruud Gullit</a>. The club once again finished 13th in the league and lost the <a href="1999%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1999 FA Cup Final</a>. Gullit fell into disagreements with the squad and chairman <a href="Freddy%20Shepherd">Freddy Shepherd</a>, and quit the club five games into the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000 season</a> with the team bottom of the table to be replaced by <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a>. In 1999 Newcastle was <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">5th-highest revenue producing club in the world</a>; second in England behind <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>.
A title challenge emerged during the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2001–02 season</a>, and Newcastle's fourth-place finish saw them qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>. The following season, Robson guided the team to another title challenge and finished third in the League, and the second group stage of the Champions League, after being the first team to have progressed past the first group stage after losing their first three games. Newcastle finished fifth in the league at the end of the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2003–04 season</a>, and exited the Champions League in the qualifying rounds, but despite this Robson was sacked in August 2004 following a series of disagreements with the club.
<a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a> was brought in as manager early in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2004–05 season</a>. In his time at the helm, he broke the club's transfer record by signing <a href="Michael%20Owen">Michael Owen</a> for £16.8 million. Souness also took Newcastle to the quarter-finals of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup">2004–05 UEFA Cup</a> with Alan Shearer winning the tournament's golden boot as well. However, he was sacked in February 2006 after a bad start to the club's <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2005–06 season</a>. <a href="Glenn%20Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a> took over, initially on a temporary basis, before being appointed full-time manager at the end of the season. Shearer retired at the end of the 2005–06 season as the club's all-time record goal scorer, with 206 goals.
In 2006, Newcastle won the Intertoto Cup for the first time in their history, and their first European trophy since 1973.
Despite finishing the 2005–06 season in seventh, Roeder's fortunes changed in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2006–07 season</a>, with a terrible injury run to the senior squad, and he left the club by mutual consent on 6 May 2007. After the 2006–07 season, and inside the Premier League era, Newcastle United were now the fifth most successful Premiership club in terms of points gained.
<a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> was appointed Roeder's replacement as manager on 15 May 2007.
2007–2021: Mike Ashley era.
On 7 June, Freddy Shepherd's final shares in the club were sold to <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28businessman%29">Mike Ashley</a> and Shepherd was replaced as chairman by <a href="Chris%20Mort">Chris Mort</a> on 25 July. Ashley then announced he would be delisting the club from the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> upon completion of the takeover. The club officially ceased trading on the Stock Exchange as of 8am on 18 July 2007 at 5p a share.
Allardyce departed the club on in January 2008 by mutual consent after a bad start to the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>, and Kevin Keegan was reappointed as Newcastle manager. Mort stepped down as chairman in June and was replaced by <a href="Derek%20Llambias">Derek Llambias</a>, a long-term associate of Ashley. Newcastle finished the 2007–08 season in 12th place, but as the season drew to a close, Keegan publicly criticised the board, stating they were not providing the team enough financial support.
In September 2008, Keegan resigned as manager, stating: "It's my opinion that a manager must have the right to manage and that clubs should not impose upon any manager any player that he does not want". Former <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon</a> manager <a href="Joe%20Kinnear">Joe Kinnear</a> was appointed as his replacement, but in February 2009, due to his heart surgery, Alan Shearer was appointed interim manager in his absence. Under Shearer, the club were relegated to the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> at the end of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 season</a>, the first time the club had left the Premier League since joining it in 1993.
Following their relegation, the club was put up for sale in June 2009, with an asking price of £100 million. <a href="Chris%20Hughton">Chris Hughton</a> was given the manager job on a caretaker basis before taking over full-time on 27 October 2009. On the same day, Ashley announced that the club was no longer for sale.
Hughton led Newcastle to win the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League%20Championship">2009–10 Championship</a>, securing automatic promotion on 5 April 2010 with five games remaining, and securing the title on 19 April; Newcastle were promoted back to the Premier League after just one season away.
Under Hughton, Newcastle enjoyed a strong start to the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2010–11 season</a>, but he was sacked on 6 December 2010. The club's board stated that they felt "an individual with more managerial experience [was] needed to take the club forward." Three days later, <a href="Alan%20Pardew">Alan Pardew</a> was appointed as manager with a five-and-a-half-year contract. Despite some turbulence, Newcastle were able to finish 12th at the end of the season, with one particular highlight being a 4–4 home draw against Arsenal that saw Newcastle come back from four goals down to claim a point.
The start of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2011–12 season</a> was very successful as they went on to enjoy one of their strongest openings to a season, playing 11 consecutive games unbeaten. Newcastle eventually secured a place in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2012–13 Europa League</a> with a fifth-place finish, their highest league position since the Bobby Robson days. Further honours were to come as Pardew won both the <a href="Premier%20League%20Manager%20of%20the%20Season">Premier League Manager of the Season</a> and the <a href="LMA%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year">LMA Manager of the Year</a> awards.
In the following season Newcastle made few acquisitions in the summer and suffered injuries over the season. As a result, the first half of the season was marred by a run of 10 losses in 13 games, which saw the club sink near the relegation zone. The Europa League campaign was largely successful with the team making the quarter-finals before bowing out to <a href="2013%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">eventual finalists</a> Benfica. Domestically, Newcastle struggled, and stayed up after a 2–1 victory over already-relegated <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> on the penultimate game of the season.
The <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a> saw Newcastle fail to win any of their first seven games, prompting fans to start a campaign to get Pardew sacked as manager before an upturn in form saw them climb to fifth in the table. Pardew left for <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> in December. On 26 January 2015, his assistant <a href="John%20Carver%20%28footballer%29">John Carver</a> was put in charge for the remainder of the season but came close to relegation, staying up on the final day with a 2–0 home win against West Ham, with <a href="Jon%C3%A1s%20Guti%C3%A9rrez">Jonás Gutiérrez</a>, who beat <a href="testicular%20cancer">testicular cancer</a> earlier in the season, scoring the team's second goal.
On 9 June 2015, Carver was sacked and replaced by <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a> the following day. On 11 March 2016, McClaren was sacked after nine months as manager, with Newcastle in 19th place in the Premier League and the club having won just six of 28 Premier League games during his time at the club. He was replaced by Spaniard <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a> on the same day, who signed a three-year deal, but was not able to prevent the club from being relegated for the second time under Ashley's ownership.
Newcastle returned to the Premier League at the first attempt, winning the Championship title in May 2017. In October, Mike Ashley put Newcastle United up for sale for the second time. The team finished the season with a 3–0 win over <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League">the previous year's champions</a> Chelsea, finishing tenth in the league, their highest finish in four years. The <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">following season</a> saw a 13th-place finish, despite being in the relegation zone in January. Ashley came under increased scrutiny for his lack of investment in the squad and apparent focus on other business ventures. Benitez left his position on 30 June 2019 after rejecting a new contract.
On 17 July 2019, former Sunderland manager and Newcastle fan <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a> was appointed as manager on a three-year contract. Bruce oversaw 13th and 12th-placed finishes during his two full seasons in charge.
2021–present: PIF era.
On 7 October 2021, after 14 years as owner, Ashley sold the club to a new consortium for a reported £305 million. The consortium was made up of Saudi Arabia's <a href="Public%20Investment%20Fund">Public Investment Fund</a>, <a href="RB%20Sports%20%26amp%3B%20Media">RB Sports & Media</a> and <a href="PCP%20Capital%20Partners">PCP Capital Partners</a>. On 20 October, Bruce left his position by mutual consent, after receiving a reported £8 million payout. <a href="Eddie%20Howe">Eddie Howe</a> was appointed as Bruce's replacement on 8 November. Howe guided the club to an 11th-place finish after a run of 12 wins in their final 18 games, and Newcastle became the first team in Premier League history to avoid relegation after failing to win any of their first 14 games.
On 21 August 2022, <a href="Newcastle%20United%20W.F.C.">Newcastle United Women</a> moved into the club's ownership for the first time, after a formal restructuring. On 22 May 2023, the club sealed qualification for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years, after a 0–0 home draw with <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>. The season was the subject of the <a href="Amazon%20Prime%20Video">Amazon Prime Video</a> documentary "We Are Newcastle United".
Club identity.
The club's home colours are a black and white striped shirt. Shorts and socks are usually black with white trim, though white socks are sometimes worn. Newcastle's colours at the outset were generally the home kit of Newcastle East End, comprising plain red shirts with white shorts and red socks. In 1894, the club adopted the black and white striped shirts, which had been used as the reserve team's colours. These colours were chosen for the senior team because they were not associated with either of the two teams United were merged from. They played in grey shorts until 1897, and between 1897 and 1921, they played in blue shorts before adopting the black shorts they play in now.
United's away colours have changed a number of times over the years. They played in white shirts and black shorts from 1914 until 1961, and then white shorts until 1966. They then played in yellow shirts and blue shorts for the 1967–68 season, but from 1969 to 1974 played in all red with an all blue third kit. In 1974, they returned to a yellow shirt, which they played with various coloured shorts until 1983. They played in all grey from 1983 to 1988, before once again returning to the yellow kit until 1993. Since 1995, the <a href="away%20kit">away kit</a> has changed frequently and has not been the same for more than a single season.
The current club crest was first used in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">1988–89 season</a>. The crest includes elements from the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the city of <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>the two sea horses representing Tyneside's strong connections with the sea, the castle representing the city's <a href="keep">keep</a>. The city's coat of arms were first embroidered on the team's shirts in 1969 and worn as standard until 1976. A scroll at the bottom featured the city's motto in Latin; "fortiter defendit triumphans" which translates into English as "triumphing by brave defence". From 1976 until 1983, the club wore a specific badge which was developed to wear in place of the city's coat of arms. The design was of a circular shape, which featured the club's name in full, it contained a magpie standing in front of the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a> with the historic keep of Newcastle in the background. A more simplistic design followed in 1983, featuring the initials of the club's name, NUFC with the small magpie used in the previous crest within the horizontally laid "C,"; this logo was relatively short lived and was discontinued after 1988.
In May 2013, Newcastle announced a sponsorship which featured the <a href="Wonga.com">Wonga.com</a> logo on kits. This attracted criticism from many Newcastle supporters. In July 2013, it was reported that Newcastle striker and practising Muslim <a href="Papiss%20Ciss%C3%A9">Papiss Cissé</a> refused to wear any official kit or training wear with reference to Wonga.com as it did not align with his religious beliefs. The matter was later resolved.
On 15 May 2017, the home shirt for the 2017–18 season was revealed, featuring the logo of new sponsors <a href="TGP%20Europe">Fun88</a>. The shirt was shown to include a gold and silver commemorative crest to mark the club's 125th football season, based on the city's coat of arms. It was also announced that the kit would feature red numbers for the first time since the 1992–93 season.
Newcastle United's current kit sponsor is <a href="Sela%20%28company%29">Sela</a>, a deal that started in 2023. Previous kit sponsors include <a href="Scottish%20%26amp%3B%20Newcastle">Newcastle Breweries</a> (1980–1986), <a href="De%20Vere%20Group">Greenall's Beers</a> (1986–1990), <a href="McEwan%27s">McEwan's Lager</a> and <a href="Newcastle%20Brown%20Ale">Newcastle Brown Ale</a> (1990–2000), <a href="NTL%20Incorporated">NTL</a> (2000–2003), <a href="Northern%20Rock">Northern Rock</a> (2003–2012), <a href="Virgin%20Money">Virgin Money</a> (2012–2013), Wonga.com (2013–2017), and <a href="TGP%20Europe">Fun88</a> (2017–2023).
Newcastle United's current kit manufacturer is <a href="Castore">Castore</a>, in a deal that started in 2021. Previous kit manufacturers include <a href="Bukta">Bukta</a> (1974–1975, 1976–1980), <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> (1975–1976, 1980–1993), <a href="ASICS%20Corporation">Asics</a> (1993–1995), <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> (1995–2010), and Puma (2010–2021).

Stadium.
Throughout Newcastle United's history, their home venue has been St James' Park, the oldest and largest football stadium in North East England, as well as the seventh-largest football stadium in the Premier League. It has hosted 10 international football matches at senior level, the first in 1901 and the most recent in 2005. It was used as a venue for both the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> and the <a href="2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2015 Rugby World Cup</a> and has been a regular venue for Rugby League's <a href="Magic%20Weekend">Magic Weekend</a>, attracting record crowds.
Football had been played at St James' Park as early as 1880, the ground being occupied by Newcastle Rangers, before becoming the home of Newcastle West End in 1886. Its lease was then bought by Newcastle East End in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 20th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a>. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and Sir John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,305.
In October 2009, Ashley announced that he planned to lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium. This name was only supposed to be used until the end of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Newcastle%20United%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 season</a>, but lasted until November 2011. On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this was an interim name to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium. The company, owned by Ashley, was not paying anything for the deal. In October 2012, <a href="payday%20loan">payday loan</a> company Wonga.com became Newcastle United's main commercial sponsor and purchased the stadium naming rights but restored the St James' Park name.
Following the conclusion of the 22/23 season, a small allocation of seating in between the East stand and Gallowgate end were converted into <a href="Safe%20standing">Safe standing</a> zones meaning that for the first time since 1993 St James' Park is no longer an all-seater stadium much like many other Premier League grounds.
In July 2023 it was confirmed that following the re-purchase of Strawberry Place, plans for a new fan zone outside the Gallowgate End had been submitted. It will be built in partnership with Stack and Sela (The clubs front of shirt sponsor).
Since 1982, the stadium has been served by <a href="St%20James%20Metro%20station">St James Metro station</a> on the <a href="Tyne%20and%20Wear%20Metro">Tyne and Wear Metro</a>. The station is decorated in a black and white colour scheme, with archive photographs of the club's players.
The club's current training ground is the Newcastle United Training Centre, located at <a href="Darsley%20Park">Darsley Park</a>, which is north of the city at <a href="Benton%2C%20Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Benton</a>. The facility was opened in July 2003.
Following the club's ownership takeover in 2021, the Training Centre was renovated extensively, with a new reception area, restaurant, players' lounge, presentation suite, offices, medical facility, dressing room and hydrotherapy unit all constructed.
Ownership.
Newcastle United was set up as a <a href="private%20company%20limited%20by%20shares">private company limited by shares</a> on 6 September 1895. The club traded in this way for much of the 20th century, dominated by McKeag, Westwood and Seymour family ownership, until April 1997, when John Hall, who bought 72.9% of the club for £3 million in 1991, floated the club on the stock exchange as a <a href="public%20limited%20company">public limited company</a>, with less than half the shares sold to the Hall family and the majority holding going to his business partner Freddy Shepherd. Later that year, Hall stepped down as chairman and was replaced by Shepherd, with the Hall family represented on the board by John's son Douglas. In December 1998, after buying a 6.3% stake in the club for £10 million, the media group <a href="Virgin%20Media">NTL</a> had considered a full takeover of the club. This was later dropped after the <a href="Competition%20Commission">Competition Commission</a>, established in April 1999, expressed concerns about football clubs being owned by media companies.
In 2007, businessman Mike Ashley purchased the combined stakes of both Douglas and John Hall, 41% share in the club, through a holding company <a href="St%20James%20Holdings">St James Holdings</a>, with a view to buy the rest. Upon purchasing this share, he appointed Chris Mort as chairman, while gaining more shares, owning 93.19% of the club by 29 June 2007. This figure reached 95% on 11 July 2007, forcing the remaining shareholders to sell their shares.
After completing the purchase of the club, Ashley had announced that he planned to sell the club on three occasions. The first occurred after fan protests over the resignation of Kevin Keegan in September 2008, when Ashley stated, "I have listened to you. You want me out. That is what I am now trying to do." However, he took it off the market on 28 December 2008 after being unable to find a buyer. On 31 May 2009, it was reported that Ashley was attempting to sell the club again. On 8 June 2009, Ashley confirmed that the club was up for sale at an asking price of £100 million. By the end of August 2009, the club was back off the market. On 16 October 2017, Newcastle United announced that Ashley had once again put the club up for sale, reporting that he hoped that a deal could be concluded by Christmas 2017.
Saudi-led takeover.
In April 2020, it was widely reported that a consortium consisting of Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media, was finalising an offer to acquire Newcastle United. The proposed sale prompted concerns and criticism, such as arguments considering it <a href="sportwashing">sportwashing</a> of Saudi Arabia's <a href="Human%20rights%20in%20Saudi%20Arabia">human rights</a> record, as well as ongoing piracy of sports broadcasts in the region.
In May 2020, two <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> MPs called upon the government to scrutinise aspects of the deal, with <a href="Karl%20McCartney">Karl McCartney</a> calling for the sale to be blocked, and <a href="Giles%20Watling">Giles Watling</a> calling upon the <a href="Department%20for%20Digital%2C%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport">Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport</a> (DCMS) to hold an oral evidence session regarding sports piracy in Saudi Arabia. In May 2020, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" reported that the Premier League had obtained a report from the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (published publicly the following month), which contained evidence that Saudi nationals had backed <a href="beoutQ">beoutQ</a> – a pirate broadcaster carrying the <a href="beIN%20Sports">beIN Sports</a> networks in the region since the <a href="Qatar%20diplomatic%20crisis">Qatar diplomatic crisis</a>. In June 2020, "The Guardian" reported that <a href="Richard%20Masters%20%28football%29">Richard Masters</a>, who appeared in front of the DCMS, had hinted the possible takeover of Newcastle United was close to completion. The MPs warned it would be humiliating to allow a Saudi Arabian consortium to take charge given the country's record on piracy and human rights.
In July 2020, "The Guardian" reported that Saudi Arabia's decision to ban beIN Sports broadcast from operating in the nation had further complicated the takeover of Newcastle United. On 30 July 2020, Saudi Arabia announced its withdrawal from the Newcastle deal, stating "with a deep appreciation for the Newcastle community and the significance of its football club, we have come to the decision to withdraw our interest in acquiring Newcastle United Football Club". The group also stated that the "prolonged process" was a major factor in them pulling out. The collapse of the takeover was met with widespread criticism from Newcastle fans, with Newcastle MP <a href="Chi%20Onwurah">Chi Onwurah</a> accusing the Premier League of treating fans of the club with "contempt" and subsequently wrote to Masters for an explanation.
Despite the consortium's withdrawal, disputes over the takeover continued. On 9 September 2020, Newcastle United released a statement claiming that the Premier League had officially rejected the takeover by the consortium and accused Masters and the Premier League board of "[not] acting appropriately in relation to [the takeover]", while stating that the club would be considering any relevant legal action. The Premier League strongly denied this in a statement released the next day, expressing "surprise" and "disappointment" at Newcastle's statement.
On 7 October 2021, the Public Investment Fund, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media confirmed that they had officially completed the acquisition of Newcastle United. An investigation in May 2022 by "The Guardian" claimed that the British government of <a href="Boris%20Johnson">Boris Johnson</a> was involved in Saudi Arabia's takeover of Newcastle United. In April 2021, it was revealed that Saudi Crown Prince <a href="Mohammed%20bin%20Salman">Mohammed bin Salman</a> had warned Johnson in a text message, stating that the Premier League's decision would impact on UK-Saudi diplomatic relations. Following the warning, Johnson had appointed his special envoy for the Gulf, <a href="Edward%20Lister">Edward Lister</a>, to take up the case. It was later reported that Johnson's extensive efforts also involved the Minister of Investment <a href="Gerry%20Grimstone%2C%20Baron%20Grimstone%20of%20Boscobel">Gerry Grimstone</a>, who held discussions with the Premier League chairman <a href="Gary%20Hoffman%20%28businessman%29">Gary Hoffman</a> and Saudi representatives well-connected with MBS' office. The UK Government and Johnson said they were not involved in the Saudi takeover. After Premier League's approval, Hoffman informed the 20 English Football clubs that there was extensive pressure from the government; he said the decision was not influenced by it. A separate report revealed that despite the US' conclusion that <a href="Assassination%20of%20Jamal%20Khashoggi">Jamal Khashoggi's assassination</a> was ordered by Saudi's Prince Mohammed, he was able to avert the owners' and directors' test of the Premier League. <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW), a campaign group, has accused the Saudi government of using football, motor racing, and golf for <a href="sportswashing">sportswashing</a>. As reported by Josh Noble, a sports editor for the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>", HRW defines sportswashing as "an effort to distract from its serious human rights abuses by taking over events that celebrate human achievement".
The Premier League had agreed to the Saudi PIF takeover of Newcastle, following "legally-binding assurances" that the Saudi state will have no control over the club. However, in February 2023, court documents published in the US claimed that the PIF is "a sovereign instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia", and that the PIF governor and Newcastle's chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan is "a sitting minister of the Saudi government". Following that, Amnesty international, which already criticized Saudi of sportswashing, pushed Premier League to re-examine the Saudi PIF takeover of the club. In March 2023, Richard Masters expressed his doubts to a committee of lawmakers, stating that he wasn't sure if Premier League had launched the investigation.
Social responsibility.
Newcastle United Foundation is an independent charity established by the club in summer 2008. It seeks to encourage learning and promote healthy living amongst disadvantaged children, young people and families in the North East region, as well as promoting equality and diversity. The charity moved into its state-of-the art ‘NUCASTLE’ building in the Arthur's Hill area of the city in 2021. Open seven days a week, NUCASTLE combines community space with education and wellness facilities, including activity and state-of-the-art cycling studios, specialist STEM room, esports room, four-court sports hall, accessible changing areas, event and meeting spaces, offices and more.
The Foundation's commitment, along with a similar foundation run by <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>, the unique relationship that Aston Villa has with <a href="Acorns%20Children%27s%20Hospice">Acorns Children's Hospice</a> and <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> has with <a href="SOS%20Children%27s%20Villages%20UK">SOS Children's Villages UK</a>, are some leading examples of commitment in the highest level of football to responsibility and change in the communities in which they work and who enrich them through their support and ticket sales. The work of these clubs, and others, is changing the way professional sport interacts with their communities and supporters.
In December 2012, the club announced that it had become the world's first carbon positive football club.
Supporters and rivalries.
Newcastle United's supporters are known for being some of the most passionate football fans in the world. In 2016, supporters founded the Wor Flags group, which continues to produce large and unique flag, banner and tifo displays at St James' Park. The group is entirely fan-funded.
The club's strongest supporter base is in the <a href="North%20East%20England">North East</a>, but supporters' clubs can be found in many countries across the world.

In a 2004 survey by <a href="Co-operative%20Financial%20Services">Co-operative Financial Services</a>, it was found that Newcastle United topped the league table for the cost incurred and distance travelled by Newcastle-based fans wishing to travel to every Premier League away game. The total distance travelled for a fan to attend every away game from Newcastle was found to be equivalent to a round-the-world trip. In the 2016–17 season, while in the second tier, Newcastle recorded an average attendance of 51,106.
The club's supporters publish a number of <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s including "True Faith" and "The Mag", along with NUFC.com, which was established in 1996.

In addition to the usual English <a href="football%20chant">football chant</a>s, Newcastle's supporters sing the traditional Tyneside song "<a href="Blaydon%20Races">Blaydon Races</a>". Prior to each home game the team enters the field to "", the closing song of the 1983 film "<a href="Local%20Hero%20%28film%29">Local Hero</a>", written by Newcastle supporter and <a href="Dire%20Straits">Dire Straits</a> founder <a href="Mark%20Knopfler">Mark Knopfler</a>. Traditionally, Newcastle's main rivals are <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>, against whom the <a href="Tyne%E2%80%93Wear%20derby">Tyne–Wear derby</a> is competed, along with <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>, with whom they compete in the <a href="Tyne-Tees%20derby">Tyne-Tees derby</a>.
In 1998, <a href="The%20Police">The Police</a> founder and Newcastle fan <a href="Sting%20%28musician%29">Sting</a> wrote a song in support of Newcastle, called "Black and White Army (Bringing The Pride Back Home)" (sang by <a href="Ryan%20Molloy">Ryan Molloy</a>). In 2015, some Newcastle fans boycotted games in protest of club management by Mike Ashley, and they were supported by famous club fans like Sting and <a href="Jimmy%20Nail">Jimmy Nail</a>.

Table.
All statistics here refer to time in the Premier League only, with the exception of 'Most Recent Finish' (which refers to all levels of play) and 'Last Promotion' (which refers to the club's last promotion from the second tier of English football), mate. For the 'Top Scorer' column, those in bold still play in the Premier League for the club shown. Premier League teams playing in the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20Premier%20League">2023–24 season</a> are indicated in bold, while founding members of the Premier League are shown in "italics". A 'spell' refers to a number of consecutive seasons within the league, uninterrupted by relegation. If the longest spell is the current spell, this is shown in bold, and if the highest finish is that of the most recent season, then this is also shown in bold. A highest finish shown in "italics" was achieved during a club's Premier League seasons.
The <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20FA%20Premier%20League">2006–07</a> season marked the first occasion former Premier League members were in all three divisions of the Football League following the relegation of <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a> to <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a>.

Oldham became the first former Premier League club to be relegated to the <a href="National%20League%20%28English%20football%29">National League</a> during the 2022–23 season.
<a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> have had the most separate spells in the Premier League, with six, which have lasted from one to three seasons in length.
Three clubs – <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>, <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> and <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> – were in the top flight in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Football%20League">1991–92</a>, and so took part in the original negotiations in 1991 that led to the formation of the Premier League, resigning their membership of <a href="English%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> along with the other 19 clubs in the top flight. However, the clubs were relegated that season and were thereby not founding Premier League members. West Ham won promotion in to Premier League <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Football%20League">the following season</a>. Notts County has not returned to the top flight since, even dropping to the <a href="National%20League%20%28English%20football%29">National League</a> in 2019. Luton Town also dropped to the National League in 2009, but managed to return to the Football League in 2014 and won promotion to the Premier League in 2023 via <a href="2023%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20final">play-off</a>.

History.
Early history (1905–1946).
Charlton Athletic F.C. was formed on 9 June 1905 by a group of 14 to 15-year-olds in East Street, Charlton, which is now known as Eastmoor Street and no longer residential.
Contrary to some histories, the club was founded as "Charlton Athletic" and had no connection to other teams or institutions such as East St Mission, Blundell Mission or Charlton Reds; it was not founded by a church, school, employer or as a franchise for an existing ground. Charlton spent most of the years before the First World War playing in local leagues but progressing rapidly, winning successive leagues and so promotions eight years in a row. In 1905–06 the team played only friendly games but joined, and won, the Lewisham League Division III for the 1906–07 season. For the 1907–08 season the team contested the Lewisham League, Woolwich League and entered the Woolwich Cup. It was also around this time the Addicks nickname was first used in the local press although it may have been in use before then. In the 1908–09 season Charlton Athletic were playing in the Blackheath and District League and by 1910–11 had progressed to the Southern Suburban League. During this period Charlton Athletic won the Woolwich Cup four times, the championship of the Woolwich League three times, won the Blackheath League twice and the Southern Suburban League three times.
They became a senior side in 1913, the same year that nearby <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Woolwich Arsenal F.C.</a> relocated to North London.
At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Charlton were one of the first clubs to close down to take part in the "Greater Game" overseas. The club was reformed in 1917, playing mainly friendlies to raise funds for charities connected to the war and for the Woolwich Memorial Hospital Cup, the trophy for which Charlton donated. It had previously been the Woolwich Cup that the team had won outright following three consecutive victories.
After the war, they joined the Kent League for one season (1919–20) before becoming professional, appointing <a href="Walter%20Rayner">Walter Rayner</a> as the first full-time manager. They were accepted by the Southern League and played just a single season (1920–21) before being voted into the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a>. Charlton's first Football League match was against <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> in August 1921, which they won 1–0. In 1923, Charlton became "giant killers" in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> beating top flight sides Manchester City, West Bromwich Albion, and Preston North End before losing to eventual winners Bolton Wanderers in the Quarter-Finals. Later that year, it was proposed that Charlton merge with Catford Southend to create a larger team with bigger support. In the 1923–24 season Charlton played in Catford at <a href="The%20Mount%20stadium">The Mount stadium</a> and wore the colours of "The Enders", light and dark blue vertical stripes. However, the move fell through and the Addicks returned to the Charlton area in 1924, returning to the traditional red and white colours in the process.
Charlton finished second bottom in the Football League in 1926 and were forced to apply for <a href="re-election%20%28Football%20League%29">re-election</a> which was successful. Three years later the Addicks won the <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Three">Division Three</a> championship in 1929<ref name="England 1928/29"></ref> and they remained at the <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Two">Division Two</a> level for four years. After <a href="relegation">relegation</a> into the Third Division south at the end of the 1932–33 season the club appointed Jimmy Seed as manager and he oversaw the most successful period in Charlton's history either side of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Seed, an ex-miner who had made a career as a footballer despite suffering the effects of poison gas in the First World War, remains the most successful manager in Charlton's history. He is commemorated in the name of a stand at the Valley. Seed was an innovative thinker about the game at a time when tactical formations were still relatively unsophisticated. He later recalled "a simple scheme that enabled us to pull several matches out of the fire" during the 1934–35 season: when the team was in trouble "the centre-half was to forsake his defensive role and go up into the attack to add weight to the five forwards." The organisation Seed brought to the team proved effective and the Addicks gained successive promotions from the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> between 1934 and 1936, becoming the first club to ever do so. Charlton finally secured promotion to the First Division by beating local rivals <a href="West%20Ham%20United">West Ham United</a> at the <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Boleyn Ground</a>, with their centre-half John Oakes playing on despite concussion and a broken nose.
In 1937, Charlton finished runners up in the First Division,<ref name="1936/1937 English Division 1 (old) Table"></ref> in 1938 finished fourth<ref name="1937/1938 English Division 1 (old) Table"></ref> and 1939 finished third.<ref name="1938/1939 English Division 1 (old) Table"></ref> They were the most consistent team in the top flight of English football over the three seasons immediately before World War II. This continued during the war years and they won the <a href="Football%20League%20War%20Cup">Football League War Cup</a> and appeared in finals.
Post-war success and fall from grace (1946–1984).
Charlton reached the <a href="1946%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1946 FA Cup Final</a>, but lost 4–1 to <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. Charlton's Bert Turner scored an own goal in the 80th minute before equalising for the Addicks a minute later to take them into extra time, but they conceded three further goals in the extra period. When the full league programme resumed in 1946–47 Charlton could finish only 19th in the First Division, just above the relegation spots, but they made amends with their performance in the FA Cup, reaching the <a href="1947%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1947 FA Cup Final</a>. This time they were successful, beating <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> 1–0, with <a href="Chris%20Duffy%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201918%29">Chris Duffy</a> scoring the only goal of the day. In this period of renewed football attendances, Charlton became one of only 13 English football teams to average over 40,000 as their attendance during a full season. The Valley was the largest football ground in the League, drawing crowds in excess of 70,000. However, in the 1950s little investment was made either for players or to The Valley, hampering the club's growth. In 1956, the then board undermined <a href="Jimmy%20Seed">Jimmy Seed</a> and asked for his resignation; Charlton were relegated the following year.
From the late 1950s until the early 1970s, Charlton remained a mainstay of the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> before relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> in 1972.<ref name="England 1971/72"></ref> It caused the team's support to drop, and even a promotion in 1975 back to the second division<ref name="England 1974/75"></ref> did little to re-invigorate the team's support and finances. In 1979–80 Charlton were relegated again to the Third Division,<ref name="England 1979/80"></ref> but won immediate promotion back to the Second Division in 1980–81.<ref name="England 1980/81"></ref> This was a turning point in the club's history leading to a period of turbulence and change including further promotion and exile. A change in management and shortly after a change in club ownership led to severe problems, such as the reckless signing of former <a href="European%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">European Footballer of the Year</a> <a href="Allan%20Simonsen">Allan Simonsen</a>, and the club looked like it would go out of business.
The "exiled" years (1985–1992).
In 1984 financial matters came to a head and the club went into administration, to be reformed as Charlton Athletic (1984) Ltd. although the club's finances were still far from secure. They were forced to leave the Valley just after the start of the 1985–86 season, after its safety was criticised by Football League officials in the wake of the <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">Bradford City stadium fire</a>.
The club began to ground-share with <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> at <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a> and this arrangement looked to be for the long-term, as Charlton did not have enough funds to revamp the Valley to meet safety requirements.
Despite the move away from the Valley, Charlton were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up at the end of 1985–86,<ref name="England 1985/86"></ref> and remained at this level for four years (achieving a highest league finish of 14th) often with late escapes, most notably against <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds</a> in 1987, where the Addicks triumphed in extra-time of the <a href="English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-off</a> final replay to secure their top flight place. In 1987 Charlton also returned to <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> for the first time since the 1947 FA Cup final for the <a href="Full%20Members%20Cup">Full Members Cup</a> final against <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn</a>.
Eventually, Charlton were relegated in 1990 along with Sheffield Wednesday and bottom club Millwall. Manager <a href="Lennie%20Lawrence">Lennie Lawrence</a> remained in charge for one more season before he accepted an offer to take charge of <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>. He was replaced by joint player-managers <a href="Alan%20Curbishley">Alan Curbishley</a> and <a href="Steve%20Gritt">Steve Gritt</a>. The pair had unexpected success in their first season finishing just outside the play-offs, and <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a> began promisingly and Charlton looked good bets for promotion in the new Division One (the new name of the old Second Division following the formation of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>). However, the club was forced to sell players such as <a href="Rob%20Lee">Rob Lee</a> to help pay for a return to the Valley, while club fans formed the Valley Party, nominating candidates to stand in local elections in 1990, pressing the local council to enable the club's return to the Valley – finally achieved in December 1992.
In March 1993, defender <a href="Tommy%20Caton">Tommy Caton</a>, who had been out of action because of injury since January 1991, announced his retirement from playing on medical advice. He died suddenly at the end of the following month at the age of 30.
Premier League years (1998–2007).
In 1995, new chairman <a href="Richard%20Murray%20%28businessman%29">Richard Murray</a> appointed <a href="Alan%20Curbishley">Alan Curbishley</a> as sole manager of Charlton. Under his sole leadership Charlton made an appearance in the play-off in 1996 but were eliminated by Crystal Palace in the semi-finals and the following season brought a disappointing 15th-place finish. <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a> was Charlton's best season for years. They reached the Division One play-off final and battled against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> in a thrilling game which ended with a 4–4 draw after extra time. Charlton won 7–6 on penalties, with the match described as "arguably the most dramatic game of football in Wembley's history", and were promoted to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>.
Charlton's first Premier League campaign began promisingly (they went top after two games) but they were unable to keep up their good form and were soon battling relegation. The battle was lost on the final day of the season but the club's board kept faith in Curbishley, confident that they could bounce back. Curbishley rewarded the chairman's loyalty with the Division One title in 2000 which signalled a return to the Premier League.
After the club's return, Curbishley proved an astute spender and by 2003 he had succeeded in establishing Charlton in the top flight. Charlton spent much of the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Premier%20League">2003–04 Premier League</a> season challenging for a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> place, but a late-season slump in form and the sale of star player <a href="Scott%20Parker%20%28footballer%29">Scott Parker</a> to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, left Charlton in seventh place, which was still the club's highest finish since the 1950s. Charlton were unable to build on this level of achievement and Curbishley departed in 2006, with the club still established as a solid mid-table side.
In May 2006, <a href="Iain%20Dowie">Iain Dowie</a> was named as Curbishley's successor, but was sacked after 12 league matches in November 2006, with only two wins. <a href="Les%20Reed%20%28football%20coach%29">Les Reed</a> replaced Dowie as manager, however he too failed to improve Charlton's position in the league table and on Christmas Eve 2006, Reed was replaced by former player <a href="Alan%20Pardew">Alan Pardew</a>. Although results did improve, Pardew was unable to keep Charlton up and relegation was confirmed in the penultimate match of the season.
Return to the Football League (2007–2014).
Charlton's return to <a href="EFL%20Championship">the second tier of English football</a> was a disappointment, with their promotion campaign tailing off to an 11th-place finish. Early in the following season the Addicks were linked with a foreign takeover, but this was swiftly denied by the club. On 10 October 2008, Charlton received an indicative offer for the club from a Dubai-based diversified investment company. However, the deal later fell through. The full significance of this soon became apparent as the club recorded net losses of over £13 million for that financial year. Pardew left on 22 November after a 2–5 home loss to Sheffield United that saw the team fall into the relegation places. Matters did not improve under caretaker manager <a href="Phil%20Parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a>, and the team went a club record 18 games without a win, a new club record, before finally achieving a 1–0 away victory over <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> in an FA Cup third round replay; Parkinson was hired on a permanent basis. The team were relegated to League One after a 2–2 draw against Blackpool on 18 April 2009.
After spending almost the entire 2009–10 season in the top six of League One, Charlton were defeated in the <a href="Football%20League%20One%20play-offs">Football League One play-offs</a> semi-final second leg on penalties against Swindon Town.
After a change in ownership, Parkinson and Charlton legend <a href="Mark%20Kinsella">Mark Kinsella</a> left after a poor run of results. Another Charlton legend, <a href="Chris%20Powell">Chris Powell</a>, was appointed manager of the club in January 2011, winning his first game in charge 2–0 over Plymouth at the Valley. This was Charlton's first league win since November. Powell's bright start continued with a further three victories, before running into a downturn which saw the club go 11 games in succession without a win. Yet the fans' respect for Powell saw him come under remarkably little criticism. The club's fortunes picked up towards the end of the season, but leaving them far short of the play-offs. In a busy summer, Powell brought in 19 new players and after a successful season, on 14 April 2012, Charlton Athletic won promotion back to the Championship with a 1–0 away win at <a href="Carlisle%20United">Carlisle United</a>. A week later, on 21 April 2012, they were confirmed as champions after a 2–1 home win over <a href="Wycombe%20Wanderers">Wycombe Wanderers</a>. Charlton then lifted the League One trophy on 5 May 2012, having been in the top position since 15 September 2011, and after recording a 3–2 victory over <a href="Hartlepool%20United">Hartlepool United</a>, recorded their highest ever league points score of 101, the highest in any professional European league that year.
In the first season back in the Championship, the 2012–13 season saw Charlton finish ninth place with 65 points, just three points short of the play-off places to the Premier League.
Duchâtelet's ownership (2014–2019).
In early January 2014 during the 2013–14 season, Belgian businessman <a href="Roland%20Duch%C3%A2telet">Roland Duchâtelet</a> took over Charlton as owner in a deal worth £14million. This made Charlton a part of a network of football clubs owned by Duchâtelet. On 11 March 2014, two days after an FA Cup quarter-final loss to Sheffield United, and with Charlton sitting bottom of the table, Powell was sacked, private emails suggesting a rift with the owner.
New manager <a href="Jose%20Riga">Jose Riga</a>, despite having to join Charlton long after the transfer window had closed, was able to improve Charlton's form and eventually guide them to 18th place, successfully avoiding relegation. After Riga's departure to manage Blackpool, former Millwall player <a href="Bob%20Peeters">Bob Peeters</a> was appointed as manager in May 2014 on a 12-month contract. Charlton started strong, but a long run of draws meant that after only 25 games in charge Peeters was dismissed with the team in 14th place. His replacement, <a href="Guy%20Luzon">Guy Luzon</a>, ensured there was no relegation battle by winning most of the remaining matches, resulting in a 12th-place finish.
The 2015–16 season began promisingly but results under Luzon deteriorated and on 24 October 2015 after a 3–0 defeat at home to <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> he was sacked. Luzon said in a "<a href="News%20Shopper">News Shopper</a>" interview that he "was not the one who chose how to do the recruitment" as the reason why he failed as manager. <a href="Karel%20Fraeye">Karel Fraeye</a> was appointed "interim head coach", but was sacked after 14 games and just two wins, with the club then second from bottom in the Championship. On 14 January 2016, Jose Riga was appointed head coach for a second spell, but could not prevent Charlton from being relegated to <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> for the 2016–17 season. Riga resigned at the end of the season. To many fans, the managerial changes and subsequent relegation to League One were symptomatic of the mismanagement of the club under Duchâtelet's ownership and several protests began.
After a slow start to the new season, with the club in 15th place of League One, the club announced that it had "parted company" with <a href="Russell%20Slade">Russell Slade</a> in November 2016. <a href="Karl%20Robinson">Karl Robinson</a> was appointed on a permanent basis soon after. He led the Addicks to an uneventful 13th-place finish. The following season Robinson had the team challenging for the play-offs, but a drop in form in March led him to resign by mutual consent. He was replaced by former player <a href="Lee%20Bowyer">Lee Bowyer</a> as caretaker manager who guided them to a 6th-place finish, but lost in the play-off semi-final.
Bowyer was appointed permanently in September on a one-year contract and after finishing third in the regular <a href="2018-19%20EFL%20League%20One">2018-19 EFL League One</a> season, Charlton beat <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> 2–1 in the League One play-off final to earn promotion back to the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a> after a three-season absence. Bowyer later signed a new one-year contract following promotion, which was later extended to three years in January 2020.
Multiple changes of ownership (2019–2023).
ESI (2019–2020).
On 29 November 2019, Charlton Athletic were acquired by East Street Investments (ESI) from <a href="Abu%20Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>, subject to EFL approval. Approval was reportedly granted on 2 January 2020. However, on 10 March 2020, a public disagreement between the new owners erupted along with reports that the main investor was pulling out, and the EFL said the takeover had not been approved. The Valley and Charlton's training ground were still owned by Duchâtelet, and a transfer embargo was in place as the new owners had not provided evidence of funding through to June 2021. On 20 April 2020, the EFL said the club was being investigated for misconduct regarding the takeover. In June 2020, Charlton confirmed that ESI had been taken over by a consortium led by businessman Paul Elliott, and said it had contacted the EFL to finalise the ownership change. However, a legal dispute involving former ESI director Matt Southall continued. He attempted to regain control of the club to prevent Elliott's takeover from going ahead, but failed and was subsequently fined and dismissed for challenging the club's directors. On 7 August 2020, the EFL said three individuals, including ESI owner Elliott and lawyer <a href="Chris%20Farnell">Chris Farnell</a>, had failed its Owners' and Directors' Test, leaving the club's ownership unclear; Charlton appealed against the decision. Meanwhile, Charlton were relegated to League One at the end of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.%20season">2019–20 season</a> after finishing 22nd. Because of the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the final games of the season were played behind closed doors, which remained the case for the majority of the following season.
Later in August, <a href="Thomas%20Sandgaard">Thomas Sandgaard</a>, a Danish businessman based in Colorado, was reported to be negotiating to buy the club. After further court hearings, Elliott was granted an injunction blocking the sale of ESI until a hearing in November 2020.
Thomas Sandgaard (2020–2023).
On 25 September 2020, Thomas Sandgaard acquired the club itself from ESI, and was reported to have passed the EFL's Owners' and Directors' Tests; the EFL noted the change in control, but said the club's sale was now "a matter for the interested parties".
On 15 March 2021, with the club lying in eighth place, Bowyer resigned as club manager and was appointed manager of <a href="Birmingham%20City">Birmingham City</a>. His successor, <a href="Nigel%20Adkins">Nigel Adkins</a>, was appointed three days later. The club finished the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.%20season">2020–21</a> season in seventh place, but started the following season by winning only two out of 13 League One matches and were in the relegation zone when Adkins was sacked on 21 October 2021. 
After a successful spell as caretaker manager, <a href="Johnnie%20Jackson">Johnnie Jackson</a> was appointed manager in December 2021, but, after Charlton finished the season in 13th place, he was also sacked. Swindon Town manager <a href="Ben%20Garner">Ben Garner</a> was appointed as his replacement in June 2022, but was sacked on 5 December 2022 with the team in 17th place. After the club was knocked out of the FA Cup by League Two side <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> on 7 December, supporters said Charlton was at its "lowest ebb in living memory", with fans "losing confidence" in owner Thomas Sandgaard. <a href="Dean%20Holden">Dean Holden</a> was appointed manager on 20 December 2022, and Charlton improved to finish the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.%20season">2022–23</a> season in 10th place.
SE7 Partners (2023–present).
On 5 June 2023, the club announced that SE7 Partners, comprising former Sunderland director <a href="Charlie%20Methven">Charlie Methven</a> and Edward Warrick, had agreed a takeover of Charlton Athletic, becoming the club's fourth set of owners in under four years. On 19 July, the EFL and FA cleared SE7 Partners to take over the club, and the deal was completed on 21 July 2023. On 27 August 2023, after one win in the opening six games of the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.%20season">2023–24 season</a>, Holden was sacked as manager, and succeeded by <a href="Michael%20Appleton">Michael Appleton</a>. On 23 January 2024, following a 3–2 defeat at The Valley against <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a> - and no wins in 10 League One games - Appleton was sacked and replaced on 4 February 2024 by <a href="Nathan%20Jones%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Nathan Jones</a>.
Club identity.
Colours and crest.
Charlton have used a number of crests and badges during their history, although the current design has not been changed since 1968. The first known badge, from the 1930s, consisted of the letters CAF in the shape of a <a href="clubs%20%28suit%29">club</a> from a pack of cards. In the 1940s, Charlton used a design featuring a <a href="European%20robin">robin</a> sitting in a football within a shield, sometimes with the letters CAFC in the four-quarters of the shield, which was worn for the <a href="1946%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1946 FA Cup Final</a>. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the crest of the former metropolitan borough of Greenwich was used as a symbol for the club but this was not used on the team's shirts.
In 1963, a competition was held to find a new badge for the club, and the winning entry was a hand holding a sword, which complied with Charlton's nickname of the time, the Valiants. Over the next five years modifications were made to this design, such as the addition of a circle surrounding the hand and sword and including the club's name in the badge. By 1968, the design had reached the one known today, and has been used continuously from this year, apart from a period in the 1970s when just the letters CAFC appeared on the team's shirts.
With the exception of one season, Charlton have always played in red and white – colours chosen by the boys who founded Charlton Athletic in 1905 after having to play their first matches in the borrowed kits of their local rivals Woolwich Arsenal, who also played in red and white. The exception came during part of the 1923–24 season when Charlton wore the colours of Catford Southend as part of the proposed move to Catford, which were light and dark blue stripes. However, after the move fell through, Charlton returned to wearing red and white as their home colours.
The sponsors were as follows:
Nicknames.
Charlton's most common nickname is The Addicks. The origin of this name is from a local fishmonger, Arthur "Ikey" Bryan, who rewarded the team with meals of haddock and chips with vinegar
The progression of the nickname can be seen in the book "The Addicks Cartoons: An Affectionate Look into the Early History of Charlton Athletic", which covers the pre-First World War history of Charlton through a narrative based on 56 cartoons which appeared in the now defunct Kentish Independent. The very first cartoon, from 31 October 1908, calls the team the Haddocks. By 1910, the name had changed to Addicks although it also appeared as Haddick. The club also have two other nicknames, The Robins, adopted in 1931, and The Valiants, chosen in a fan competition in the 1960s which also led to the adoption of the sword badge which is still in use. The Addicks nickname never went away and was revived by fans after the club lost its Valley home in 1985 and went into exile at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>. It is now once again the official nickname of the club.
Charlton fans' chants have included "Valley, Floyd Road", a song noting the stadium's address to the tune of "<a href="Mull%20of%20Kintyre%20%28song%29">Mull of Kintyre</a>".
Stadium.
The club's first ground was Siemens Meadow (1905–1907), a patch of rough ground by the River Thames. This was over-shadowed by the <a href="Siemens%20Brothers">Siemens Brothers</a> Telegraph Works. Then followed <a href="Woolwich%20Common">Woolwich Common</a> (1907–1908), Pound Park (1908–1913), and Angerstein Lane (1913–1915). After the end of the First World War, a chalk quarry known as the Swamps was identified as Charlton's new ground, and in the summer of 1919 work began to create the level playing area and remove debris from the site. The first match at this site, now known as the club's current ground The Valley, was in September 1919. Charlton stayed at The Valley until 1923, when the club moved to <a href="The%20Mount%20stadium">The Mount stadium</a> in <a href="Catford">Catford</a> as part of a proposed merger with Catford Southend Football Club. However, after this move collapsed in 1924 Charlton returned to The Valley.
During the 1930s and 1940s, significant improvements were made to the ground, making it one of the largest in the country at that time. In 1938 the highest attendance to date at the ground was recorded at over 75,000 for a <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> match against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. During the 1940s and 1950s the attendance was often above 40,000, and Charlton had one of the largest support bases in the country. However, after the club's relegation little investment was made in The Valley as it fell into decline.
In the 1980s matters came to a head as the ownership of the club and The Valley was divided. The large East Terrace had been closed down by the authorities after the <a href="Bradford%20City%20stadium%20fire">Bradford City stadium fire</a> and the ground's owner wanted to use part of the site for housing. In September 1985, Charlton made the controversial move to ground-share with South London neighbours <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> at <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a>. This move was unpopular with supporters and in the late 1980s significant steps were taken to bring about the club's return to The Valley.
A <a href="Single-issue%20politics">single issue</a> political party, the Valley Party, contested the 1990 local <a href="Royal%20Borough%20of%20Greenwich">Greenwich Borough Council</a> elections on a ticket of reopening the stadium, capturing 11% of the vote, aiding the club's return. The Valley Gold investment scheme was created to help supporters fund the return to The Valley, and several players were also sold to raise funds. For the 1991–92 season and part of the 1992–93 season, the Addicks played at <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham</a>'s <a href="The%20Boleyn%20Ground">Upton Park</a> as <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon</a> had moved into Selhurst Park alongside Crystal Palace. Charlton finally returned to The Valley in December 1992, celebrating with a 1–0 victory against <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>.
Since the return to The Valley, three sides of the ground have been completely redeveloped turning The Valley into a modern, all-seater stadium with a 27,111 capacity which is the biggest in South London. There are plans in place to increase the ground's capacity to approximately 31,000 and even around 40,000 in the future.
Supporters and rivalries.
The bulk of the club's support base comes from South East London and Kent, particularly the London boroughs of Greenwich, Bexley and Bromley. Supporters played a key role in the return of the club to The Valley in 1992 and were rewarded by being granted a voice on the board in the form of an elected supporter director. Any season ticket holder could put themselves forward for election, with a certain number of nominations, and votes were cast by all season ticket holders over the age of 18. The last such director, Ben Hayes, was elected in 2006 to serve until 2008, when the role was discontinued as a result of legal issues. Its functions were replaced by a fans forum, which met for the first time in December 2008 and is still active to this day.
Charlton's main rivals are their South London neighbours, <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> and <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>. Unlike those rivals Charlton have never competed in football's fourth tier and are the only one of the three to have won the FA Cup.
In 1985, Charlton were forced to ground-share with <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> after safety concerns at <a href="The%20Valley%20%28London%29">The Valley</a>. They played their home fixtures at the Glaziers' <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a> stadium until 1991. The arrangement was seen by Crystal Palace chairman <a href="Ron%20Noades">Ron Noades</a> as essential for the future of football, but it was unpopular with both sets of fans. Charlton fans campaigned for a return to The Valley throughout their time at Selhurst Park. In 2005, Palace were relegated by Charlton at the Valley after a 2–2 draw. Palace needed a win to survive. However, with seven minutes left, Charlton equalised, relegating their rivals. Post-match, there was a well-publicised altercation between the two chairmen of the respective clubs, <a href="Richard%20Murray%20%28businessman%29">Richard Murray</a> and <a href="Simon%20Jordan">Simon Jordan</a>. Since their first meeting in the Football League in 1925, Charlton have won 17, drawn 13 and lost 26 games against Palace. The teams last met in 2015, a 4–1 win for Palace in the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a>.
Charlton are closest in proximity to <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> than any other EFL club, with The Valley and <a href="The%20Den">The Den</a> being less than four miles () apart. They last met in July 2020, a 1–0 win for Millwall at the Valley. Since their first Football League game in 1921, Charlton have won 11, drawn 26 and lost 37 league games (the two sides also met twice in the <a href="Anglo-Italian%20Cup">Anglo-Italian Cup</a> in the 1992–93 season; Charlton winning one tie, and one draw). The Addicks have not beaten Millwall in the last 12 league fixtures between the sides; their last win came on 9 March 1996 at The Valley.

Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to as simply Tottenham () or Spurs, is a professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Tottenham">Tottenham</a>, London, England. It competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the top flight of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a>. The team has played its home matches in the 62,850-capacity <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20Stadium">Tottenham Hotspur Stadium</a> since April 2019, replacing their former home of <a href="White%20Hart%20Lane">White Hart Lane</a>, which had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site.
Founded in 1882, Tottenham's <a href="emblem">emblem</a> is a <a href="Cockfight">cockerel</a> standing upon a football, with the Latin <a href="motto">motto</a> "Audere est Facere" ("to dare is to do"). The club has traditionally worn white shirts and navy blue shorts as their home kit since the 1898–99 season. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in <a href="Bulls%20Cross">Bulls Cross</a>, <a href="Enfield%2C%20London">Enfield</a>. After its inception, Tottenham won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time in <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Cup">1901</a>, the only <a href="non-League%20football">non-League</a> club to do so since the formation of <a href="English%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23England">League and FA Cup Double</a>, winning both competitions in the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61 season</a>. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> club competition – the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>. They were also the inaugural winners of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. They collected at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s, an achievement only matched by <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>.
In domestic football, Spurs have won two <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">league titles</a>, eight FA Cups, four <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a>s, and seven <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>s. In European football, they have won one <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> and two <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>s. Tottenham were also runners-up in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2018–19 UEFA Champions League</a>. They have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, with whom they contest the <a href="North%20London%20derby">North London derby</a>. Tottenham is owned by <a href="ENIC%20Group">ENIC Group</a>, which purchased the club in 2001. The club was estimated to be <a href="Forbes%27%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs">worth</a> £1.9 billion ($2.35 billion) in 2022, and it was the <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">ninth-highest-earning</a> football club in the world, with an annual revenue of £442.8 million in 2022.
History.
Formation and early years (1882–1908).
Originally named Hotspur Football Club, the club was formed on 5 September 1882 by a group of schoolboys led by <a href="Bobby%20Buckle">Bobby Buckle</a>. They were members of the Hotspur Cricket Club and the football club was formed to play sports during the winter months. A year later the boys sought help with the club from John Ripsher, the Bible class teacher at <a href="All%20Hallows%27%20Church%2C%20Tottenham">All Hallows Church</a>, who became the first president of the club and its treasurer. Ripsher helped and supported the boys through the club's formative years, reorganised and found premises for the club. In April 1884 the club was renamed "Tottenham Hotspur Football Club" to avoid confusion with another London club named Hotspur, whose post had been mistakenly delivered to North London. Nicknames for the club include "Spurs" and "the Lilywhites".
Initially, the <a href="north%20London">north London</a> side played games between themselves and <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly matches</a> against other local clubs. The first recorded match took place on 30 September 1882 against a local team named the Radicals, which Hotspur lost 2–0. The team entered their first cup competition in the London Association Cup, and won 5–2 in their first competitive match on 17 October 1885 against a company's works team called St Albans. The club's fixtures began to attract the interest of the local community and attendances at its home matches increased. In 1892, they played for the first time in a league, the short-lived <a href="Southern%20Alliance">Southern Alliance</a>.
The club turned professional on 20 December 1895 and, in the summer of 1896, was admitted to Division One of the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> (the third tier at the time). On 2 March 1898, the club also became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company. Soon after, <a href="Frank%20Brettell">Frank Brettell</a> became the first ever manager of Spurs, and he signed <a href="John%20Cameron%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201872%29">John Cameron</a>, who took over as player-manager when Brettell left a year later. Cameron would have a significant impact on Spurs, helping the club win its first trophy, the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> title in the <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20Southern%20Football%20League">1899–1900 season</a>. The following year Spurs won the <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Cup">1901 FA Cup</a> by beating <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> 3–1 in a <a href="1901%20FA%20Cup%20Final">replay of the final</a>, after the first game ended in a 2–2 draw. In doing so they became the only <a href="non-League%20football">non-League</a> club to achieve the feat since the formation of <a href="English%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> in 1888.
Early decades in the Football League (1908–1958).
In 1908, the club was elected into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Football League Second Division</a> and won promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in their first season, finishing runners-up. In 1912, <a href="Peter%20McWilliam">Peter McWilliam</a> became manager; Tottenham finished bottom of the league at the end of the <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">1914–15</a> season when football was suspended due to the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. Spurs were relegated to the Second Division on the resumption of league football after the war, but quickly returned to the First Division as Second Division champions of the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20 season</a>.
On 23 April 1921, McWilliam guided Spurs to their second FA Cup win, beating <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> 1–0 in the <a href="1921%20FA%20Cup%20Final">Cup Final</a>. Spurs finished second to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the league in <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20in%20English%20football">1922</a>, but would finish mid-table in the next five seasons. Spurs were relegated in the <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20in%20English%20football">1927–28 season</a> after McWilliam left. For most of the 1930s and 40s, Spurs languished in the Second Division, apart from a brief return to the top flight in the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34</a> and <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20in%20English%20football">1934–35</a> seasons.
Former Spurs player <a href="Arthur%20Rowe">Arthur Rowe</a> became manager in 1949. Rowe developed a style of play, known as "<a href="push%20and%20run">push and run</a>", that proved to be successful in his early years as manager. He took the team back to the First Division after finishing top of the Second Division in the <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20in%20English%20football">1949–50 season</a>. In his second season in charge, Tottenham won their first ever top-tier league championship title when they finished top of the First Division for the <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1950–51 season</a>. Rowe resigned in April 1955 due to a stress-induced illness from managing the club. Before he left, he signed one of Spurs' most celebrated players, <a href="Danny%20Blanchflower">Danny Blanchflower</a>, who won the <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a> twice while at Tottenham.
Bill Nicholson and the glory years (1958–1974).
<a href="Bill%20Nicholson%20%28footballer%29">Bill Nicholson</a> took over as manager in October 1958. He became the club's most successful manager, guiding the team to major trophy success three seasons in a row in the early 1960s: the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">Double</a> in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1961</a>, the FA Cup in 1962 and the <a href="Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a> in <a href="1963%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1963</a>. Nicholson signed <a href="Dave%20Mackay">Dave Mackay</a> and <a href="John%20White%20%28footballer%20born%201937%29">John White</a> in 1959, two influential players of the Double-winning team, and <a href="Jimmy%20Greaves">Jimmy Greaves</a> in 1961, the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of the <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20first%20tier%20top%20scorers">top tier of English football</a>.
The <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1960–61 season</a> started with a run of 11 wins, followed by a draw and another four wins, at that time the best ever start by any club in the top flight of English football. The title was won on 17 April 1961 when they beat the eventual runner-up <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> at home 2–1, with three more games still to play. The Double was achieved when Spurs won 2–0 against <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> in the <a href="1961%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> of the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20FA%20Cup">1960–61 FA Cup</a>. It was the first Double of the 20th century, and the first since <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> achieved the feat in <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1897</a>. The next year Spurs won their consecutive FA Cup after beating <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> in the <a href="1962%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1962 FA Cup Final</a>.
On 15 May 1963, Tottenham became the first British team to win a European trophy by winning the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1962–63 European Cup Winners' Cup</a> when they beat <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> 5–1 in the <a href="1963%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">final</a>. Spurs also became the first British team to win two different European trophies when they won the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20UEFA%20Cup">1971–72 UEFA Cup</a> with a rebuilt team that included <a href="Martin%20Chivers">Martin Chivers</a>, <a href="Pat%20Jennings">Pat Jennings</a>, and <a href="Steve%20Perryman">Steve Perryman</a>. They had also won the <a href="1967%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup in 1967</a>, two <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>s (in <a href="1971%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1971</a> and <a href="1973%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1973</a>), as well as a second place league finish (<a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1962–63</a>) and runners-up to the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20UEFA%20Cup">1973–74 UEFA Cup</a>. In total, Nicholson won eight major trophies in his 16 years at the club as manager.
Burkinshaw to Venables (1974–1992).
Spurs went into a period of decline after the successes of the early 1970s, and Nicholson resigned after a poor start to the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75 season</a>. The team was then relegated at the end of the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77 season</a> with <a href="Keith%20Burkinshaw">Keith Burkinshaw</a> as manager. Burkinshaw quickly returned the club to the top flight, building a team that included <a href="Glenn%20Hoddle">Glenn Hoddle</a>, as well as two Argentinians, <a href="Osvaldo%20Ardiles">Osvaldo Ardiles</a> and <a href="Ricardo%20Villa">Ricardo Villa</a>, which was unusual as players from outside the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> were rare at that time. The team that Burkinshaw rebuilt went on to win the FA Cup in <a href="1981%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1981</a> and <a href="1982%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1982</a> and the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> in <a href="1984%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">1984</a>.
The 1980s was a period of change that began with a new phase of redevelopment at White Hart Lane, as well as a change of directors. <a href="Irving%20Scholar">Irving Scholar</a> took over the club and moved it in a more commercial direction, the beginning of the transformation of English football clubs into commercial enterprises. Debt at the club would again lead to a change in the boardroom, and <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a> teamed up with businessman <a href="Alan%20Sugar">Alan Sugar</a> in June 1991 to take control of Tottenham Hotspur <a href="Public%20limited%20company">plc</a>. Venables, who had become manager in 1987, signed players such as <a href="Paul%20Gascoigne">Paul Gascoigne</a> and <a href="Gary%20Lineker">Gary Lineker</a>. Under Venables, Spurs won the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20FA%20Cup">1990–91 FA Cup</a>, making them the first club to win eight FA Cups.
Premier League football (1992–present).
Tottenham was one of the five clubs that pushed for the founding of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, created with the approval of <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a>, replacing the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Football League First Division</a> as the highest division of English football. Despite a succession of managers and players such as <a href="Teddy%20Sheringham">Teddy Sheringham</a>, <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann">Jürgen Klinsmann</a> and <a href="David%20Ginola">David Ginola</a>, for a long period in the Premier League until the late 2000s, Spurs finished mid-table most seasons with few trophies won. They won the <a href="1999%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup in 1999</a> under <a href="George%20Graham%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201944%29">George Graham</a>, and again in <a href="2008%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2008</a> under <a href="Juande%20Ramos">Juande Ramos</a>. Performance improved under <a href="Harry%20Redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a> with players such as <a href="Gareth%20Bale">Gareth Bale</a> and <a href="Luka%20Modri%C4%87">Luka Modrić</a>, and the club finished in the top five in the early 2010s.
In February 2001, Sugar sold his shareholding in Spurs to <a href="ENIC%20Group">ENIC Sports plc</a>, run by <a href="Joe%20Lewis%20%28British%20businessman%29">Joe Lewis</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Levy%20%28Tottenham%20Hotspur%29">Daniel Levy</a>, and stepped down as chairman. Lewis and Levy would eventually own 85% of the club, with Levy responsible for the running of the club. They appointed <a href="Mauricio%20Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> as head coach, who was in the role between 2014 and 2019. Under Pochettino, Spurs finished second in the 2016–17 season, their highest league finish since the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Football%20League">1962–63 season</a>, and advanced to the <a href="2018-19%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> final in 2019, the club's first, where they ultimately lost to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> <a href="2019%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2–0</a>. Pochettino was subsequently sacked after a poor start to the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">2019–20 season</a>, in November 2019, and was replaced by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a>.
Mourinho was sacked in April 2021, while <a href="Nuno%20Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Nuno Espírito Santo</a> lasted just four months as his successor. The next manager, <a href="Antonio%20Conte">Antonio Conte</a>, guided Spurs to fourth during the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Premier%20League">2021–22 season</a> and back to a Champions League place. Following a poor run of form, Conte criticised the players and management of the club in press conferences; after exiting both the Champions League and FA Cup, he departed the club by mutual agreement in March 2023. <a href="Ange%20Postecoglou">Ange Postecoglou</a> took over as head coach on 1 July 2023.
Stadiums.
Early grounds.
Spurs played their early matches on public land at the Park Lane end of <a href="Tottenham%20Marshes">Tottenham Marshes</a>, where they had to mark out and prepare their own pitch. Occasionally fights broke out on the marshes in disputes with other teams over the use of the ground. The first Spurs game reported by the local press took place on Tottenham Marshes on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9–0. It was at this ground that, in 1887, Spurs first played the team that would later become their arch rivals, <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> (then known as Royal Arsenal), leading 2–1 until the match was called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.
As they played on public parkland, the club could not charge admission fees and, while the number of spectators grew to a few thousand, it yielded no gate receipts. In 1888, the club rented a pitch between numbers 69 and 75 Northumberland Park at a cost of £17 per annum, where spectators were charged <a href="Threepence%20%28British%20coin%29">3d</a> a game, raised to 6d for cup ties. The first game at the Park was played on 13 October 1888, a reserve match that yielded gate receipts of 17 shillings. The first stand with just over 100 seats and changing rooms underneath was built at the ground for the 1894–95 season at a cost of £60. However, the stand was blown down a few weeks later and had to be repaired. In April 1898, 14,000 fans turned up to watch Spurs play Woolwich Arsenal. Spectators climbed on the roof of the refreshment stand for a better view of the match. The stand collapsed, causing a few injuries. As Northumberland Park could no longer cope with the larger crowds, Spurs were forced to look for a larger ground and moved to the White Hart Lane site in 1899.
White Hart Lane.
The White Hart Lane ground was built on an unused <a href="plant%20nursery">plant nursery</a> owned by the <a href="Charrington%20Brewery">Charrington Brewery</a> and located behind a <a href="public%20house">public house</a> named the White Hart on Tottenham High Road (the road White Hart Lane actually lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance). The ground was initially leased from Charringtons, and the stands they used at Northumberland Park were moved here, giving shelter for 2,500 spectators. <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> were the first visitors to 'the Lane' in a friendly watched by 5,000 people and yielding £115 in receipts; Spurs won 4–1. <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> became the first competitive visitors to the ground and 11,000 people saw them lose 1–0 to Tottenham. In 1905, Tottenham raised enough money to buy the <a href="fee%20simple">freehold</a> to the land, as well as land at the northern (Paxton Road) end.
After Spurs were admitted to the Football League, the club started to build a new stadium, with stands designed by <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> being constructed over the next two and a half decades. The West Stand was added in 1909, the East Stand was also covered this year and extended further two years later. The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over £3,000 some two years later. This increased the stadium's capacity to around 58,000, with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators and cost £60,000.
Starting in the early 1980s, the stadium underwent another major phase of redevelopment. The West Stand was replaced by an expensive new structure in 1982, and the East Stand was renovated in 1988. In 1992, following the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>'s recommendation that Premier League clubs eliminate standing areas, the lower terraces of the south and east stand were converted to seating, with the North Stand becoming all-seater the following season. The South Stand redevelopment was completed in March 1995 and included the first giant <a href="Sony">Sony</a> <a href="Jumbotron">Jumbotron</a> TV screen for live game coverage and away match screenings. In the 1997–98 season the Paxton Road stand received a new upper tier and a second Jumbotron screen. Minor amendments to the seating configuration were made in 2006, bringing the capacity of the stadium to 36,310.
By the turn of the millennium, the capacity of White Hart Lane had become lower than other major Premier League clubs. Talks began over the future of the ground with a number of schemes considered, such as increasing the stadium capacity through redevelopment of the current site, or using of the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28London%29">2012 London Olympic Stadium</a> in <a href="Stratford%2C%20London">Stratford</a>. Eventually the club settled on the <a href="Northumberland%20Development%20Project">Northumberland Development Project</a>, whereby a new stadium would be built on a larger piece of land that incorporated the existing site. In 2016, the northeast corner of the stadium was removed to facilitate the construction of the new stadium. As this reduced the stadium capacity below that required for European games, Tottenham Hotspur played every European home game in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2016–17</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>. Domestic fixtures of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2016–17 season</a> continued to be played at the Lane, but demolition of the rest of the stadium started the day after the last game of the season, and White Hart Lane was completely demolished by the end of July 2017.
Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
In October 2008, the club announced a plan to build a new stadium immediately to the north of the existing White Hart Lane stadium, with the southern half of the new stadium's pitch overlapping the northern part of the Lane. This proposal would become the <a href="Northumberland%20Development%20Project">Northumberland Development Project</a>. The club submitted a planning application in October 2009 but, following critical reactions to the plan, it was withdrawn in favour of a substantially revised planning application for the stadium and other associated developments. The new plan was resubmitted and approved by <a href="Haringey%20Council">Haringey Council</a> in September 2010, and an agreement for the Northumberland Development Project was signed on 20 September 2011.
After a long delay over the compulsory purchase order of local businesses located on land to the north of the stadium and a legal challenge against the order, resolved in early 2015, planning application for another new design was approved by Haringey Council on 17 December 2015. Construction started in 2016, and the new stadium was scheduled to open during the 2018–19 season. While it was under construction, all Tottenham home games in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Premier%20League">2017–18 season</a> as well as all but five in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Premier%20League">2018–19</a> were played at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>. After two successful test events, Tottenham Hotspur officially moved into the new ground on 3 April 2019 with a Premier League match against <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> which Spurs won 2–0. The new stadium is called Tottenham Hotspur Stadium while a naming-rights agreement is reached.
Training grounds.
An early training ground used by Tottenham was located at Brookfield Lane in <a href="Cheshunt">Cheshunt</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. The club bought the 11-acre ground used by <a href="Cheshunt%20F.C.">Cheshunt F.C.</a> in 1952 for £35,000. It had three pitches, including a small stadium with a small stand used for matches by the junior team. The ground was later sold for over £4 million, and the club moved the training ground to the Spurs Lodge on Luxborough Lane, <a href="Chigwell">Chigwell</a> in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, opened in September 1996 by <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>. The training ground and press centre in Chigwell were used until 2014.
In 2007, Tottenham bought a site at <a href="Bulls%20Cross">Bulls Cross</a> in <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Enfield">Enfield</a>, a few miles south of their former ground in Cheshunt. A new training ground was constructed at the site for £45 million, which opened in 2012. The 77-acre site has 15 grass pitches and one-and-a-half artificial pitches, as well as a covered artificial pitch in the main building. The main building on Hotspur Way also has hydrotherapy and swimming pools, gyms, medical facilities, dining and rest areas for players as well as classrooms for academy and schoolboy players. A 45-bedroom players lodge with catering, treatment, rest and rehabilitation facilities was later added at Myddleton Farm next to the training site in 2018. The lodge is mainly used by Tottenham's first team and Academy players, but it has also been used by national football teams – the first visitors to use the facilities at the site were the <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazilian team</a> in preparation for the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 FIFA World Cup</a>.
Crest.
Since the <a href="1921%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1921 FA Cup Final</a> the Tottenham Hotspur <a href="Crest%20%28heraldry%29">crest</a> has featured a <a href="cockerel">cockerel</a>. <a href="Henry%20Percy%20%28Hotspur%29">Harry Hotspur</a>, after whom the club is named, was said to have been given the nickname Hotspur as he dug in his spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles, and spurs are also associated with <a href="Cockfight">fighting cocks</a>. The club used <a href="spur">spur</a>s as a symbol in 1900, which then evolved into a fighting cock. A former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football at a cost of £35 (), and this figure was then placed on top of the <a href="White%20Hart%20Lane">West Stand</a> the end of the 1909–10 season. Since then the cockerel and ball emblem has become a part of the club's identity. The club badge on the shirt used in 1921 featured a cockerel within a shield, but it was changed to a cockerel sitting on a ball in the late 1960s.
Between 1956 and 2006 Spurs used a faux <a href="heraldic%20shield">heraldic shield</a> featuring a number of local landmarks and associations. The castle is <a href="Bruce%20Castle">Bruce Castle</a>, 400 yards from the ground and the trees are the <a href="Seven%20Sisters%2C%20London">Seven Sisters</a>. The arms featured the Latin motto "Audere Est Facere" (to dare is to do).
In 1983, to overcome unauthorised <a href="copyright%20infringement">"pirate"</a> merchandising, the club's badge was altered by adding the two red <a href="supporter">heraldic lions</a> to flank the shield (which came from the arms of the Northumberland family, of which Harry Hotspur was a member), as well as the <a href="motto">motto scroll</a>. This device appeared on Spurs' playing kits for three seasons 1996–99.
In 2006, in order to <a href="rebrand">rebrand</a> and modernise the club's image, the club badge and coat of arms were replaced by a professionally designed logo/emblem. This revamp displayed a sleeker and more elegant cockerel standing on an old-time football. The club claimed that they dropped their club name and would be using the rebranded logo only on playing kits. In November 2013, Tottenham forced non-league club <a href="Fleet%20Spurs%20F.C.">Fleet Spurs</a> to change their badge because its new design was "too similar" to the Tottenham crest.
In 2017, Spurs added a shield around the cockerel logo on the shirts similar to the 1950s badge, but with the cockerel of modern design. The shield was however removed the following season.
Kit.
The first Tottenham kit recorded in 1883 included a navy blue shirt with a letter H on a scarlet shield on the left breast, and white breeches. In 1884 or 1885, the club changed to a "quartered" kit similar to <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> after watching them win in the <a href="1884%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1884 FA Cup Final</a>. After they moved to Northumberland Park in 1888, they returned to the navy blue shirts for the <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1889–90 season</a>. Their kit changed again to red shirt and blue shorts in 1890, and for a time the team were known as 'the Tottenham Reds'. Five years later in 1895, the year they became a professional club, they switched to a chocolate and gold striped kit.
In the <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1898–99 season</a>, their final year at Northumberland Park, the club switched colours to white shirts and blue shorts, same colour choice as that for <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>. White and navy blue have remained as the club's basic colours ever since, with the white shirts giving the team the nickname "The Lilywhites". In 1921, the year they won the FA Cup, the cockerel badge was added to the shirt for the final. A club crest has featured on the shirt since, and Spurs became the first major club to have its club crest on the players shirt on every match apart from the war years. In 1939 numbers first appeared on shirt backs.
In the early days, the team played in kits sold by local outfitters. An early supplier of Spurs' jerseys recorded was a firm on <a href="Seven%20Sisters%20Road">Seven Sisters Road</a>, HR Brookes. In the 1920s, <a href="Bukta">Bukta</a> produced the jerseys for the club. From the mid-1930s onwards, <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> was the supplier for forty years. In 1959, the V-neck shirt replaced the collared shirts of the past, and then in 1963, the crew neck shirt appeared (the style has fluctuated since). In 1961, Bill Nicholson sent Spurs players out to play in white instead of navy shorts for their European campaign, starting a tradition which continues to this day in European competitions.
In 1977, a deal was signed with <a href="Admiral%20%28sportswear%29">Admiral</a> to supply the team their kits. Although Umbro kits in generic colours had been sold to football fans since 1959, it was with the Admiral deal that the market for replica shirts started to take off. Admiral changed the plain colours of earlier strips to shirts with more elaborate designs, which included manufacturer's logos, stripes down the arms and trims on the edges. Admiral was replaced by <a href="Le%20Coq%20Sportif">Le Coq Sportif</a> in the summer of 1980. In 1985, Spurs entered into a business partnership with <a href="Hummel%20International">Hummel</a>, who then supplied the strips. However, the attempt by Tottenham to expand the business side of the club failed, and in 1991, they returned to Umbro. In 1991, the club was the first to wear long-cut shorts, an innovation at a time when football kits all featured shorts cut well above the knee. Umbro was followed by <a href="Pony%20International">Pony</a> in 1995, <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> in 1999, <a href="Kappa%20%28company%29">Kappa</a> in 2002, and a five-year deal with <a href="Puma%20AG">Puma</a> in 2006. In March 2011, <a href="Under%20Armour">Under Armour</a> announced a five-year deal to supply Spurs with shirts and other apparel from the start of 2012–13, with the home, away and the third kits revealed in July and August 2012. The shirts incorporate technology that can monitor the players' heart rate and temperature and send the <a href="biometric%20data">biometric data</a> to the coaching staff. In June 2017, it was announced that <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> would be their new kits supplier, with the 2017–18 kit released on 30 June, featuring the Spurs' crest encased in a shield, paying homage to Spurs' 1960–61 season, where they became the first post-war-club to win both the Football League First Division and the FA Cup. In October 2018, Nike agreed a 15-year deal reportedly worth £30 million a year with the club to supply their kits until 2033.
Shirt sponsorship in English football was first adopted by the non-league club <a href="Kettering%20Town%20F.C.">Kettering Town F.C.</a> in 1976 despite it being banned by the FA. FA soon lifted the ban, and this practice spread to the major clubs when sponsored shirts were allowed on non-televised games in 1979, and then on televised games as well in 1983. In December 1983, after the club was floated on the London Stock Exchange, <a href="Holsten">Holsten</a> became the first commercial sponsor logo to appear on a Spurs shirt. When <a href="TUI%20UK">Thomson</a> was chosen as kit sponsor in 2002 some Tottenham fans were unhappy as the shirt-front logo was red, the colour of their closest rivals, <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. In 2006, Tottenham secured a £34 million sponsorship deal with internet casino group Mansion.com. In July 2010, Spurs announced a two-year shirt sponsorship contract with software infrastructure company <a href="Autonomy%20Corporation">Autonomy</a> said to be worth £20 million. A month later they unveiled a £5 million deal with leading specialist bank and asset management firm <a href="Investec%20Bank">Investec</a> as shirt sponsor for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> and domestic cup competitions for the next two years. Since 2014, <a href="AIA%20Group%20Limited">AIA</a> has been the main shirt sponsor, initially in a deal worth over £16 million annually, increased to a reported £40 to £45 million per year in 2019 in an eight-year deal that lasts until 2027. In 2023, Tottenham provisionally agreed a three-year shirt sponsorship deal with South Africa Tourism (SAT) starting in 2023/24 and ending in the 2026/27 season.
Ownership.
Tottenham Hotspur F.C. became a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a>, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company Ltd, on 2 March 1898 so as to raise funds for the club and limit the personal liability of its members. 8,000 shares were issued at £1 each, although only 1,558 shares were taken up in the first year. 4,892 shares were sold in total by 1905. A few families held significant shares; they included the Wale family, who had association with the club since the 1930s, as well as the Richardson and the Bearman families. From 1943 to 1984, members of these families were chairmen of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. after Charles Robert who had been chairman since 1898 died.
In the early 1980s, cost overruns in the construction of a new West Stand together with the cost of rebuilding the team in previous years led to accumulating debts. In November 1982, a fan of the club <a href="Irving%20Scholar">Irving Scholar</a> bought 25% of Tottenham for £600,000, and together with Paul Bobroff gained control of the club. In order to bring in funds, Scholar <a href="Flotation%20%28shares%29">floated</a> Tottenham Hotspur <a href="Public%20limited%20company">plc</a>, which wholly owns the football club, on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> in 1983, the first European sports club to be listed in a stock market, and became the first sports company to <a href="Initial%20public%20offering">go public</a>. Fans and institutions alike can now freely buy and trade shares in the company; a court ruling in 1935 involving the club ("Berry and Stewart v Tottenham Hotspur FC Ltd") had previously established a <a href="precedent">precedent</a> in company law that the directors of a company can refuse the transfer of shares from a shareholder to another person. The share issue was successful with 3.8 million shares quickly sold. However, ill-judged business decisions under Scholar led to financial difficulties, and in June 1991 Terry Venables teamed up with businessman Alan Sugar to buy the club, initially as equal partner with each investing £3.25 million. Sugar increased his stake to £8 million by December 1991 and became the dominant partner with effective control of the club. In May 1993, Venables was sacked from the board after a dispute. By 2000, Sugar began to consider selling the club, and in February 2001, he sold the major part of his shareholding to <a href="ENIC%20Group">ENIC International Ltd</a>.
The majority shareholder, ENIC International Ltd, is an investment company established by the British billionaire <a href="Joe%20Lewis%20%28British%20businessman%29">Joe Lewis</a>. <a href="Daniel%20Levy%20%28businessman%29">Daniel Levy</a>, Lewis's partner at ENIC, is Executive Chairman of the club. They first acquired 29.9% share of the club in 1991, of which 27% was bought from Sugar for £22 million. Shareholding by ENIC increased over the decade through the purchase of the remaining 12% holding of Alan Sugar in 2007 for £25m, and the 9.9% stake belonging to <a href="Stelios%20Haji-Ioannou">Stelios Haji-Ioannou</a> through Hodram Inc. in 2009. On 21 August 2009 the club reported that they had issued a further 30 million shares to fund the initial development costs of the new stadium project, and that 27.8 million of these new shares had been purchased by ENIC. The Annual Report for 2010 indicated that ENIC had acquired 76% of all Ordinary Shares and also held 97% of all convertible redeemable preference shares, equivalent to a holding of 85% of share capital. The remaining shares are held by over 30,000 individuals. Between 2001 and 2011 shares in Tottenham Hotspur F.C. were listed on the <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">Alternative Investment Market</a> (AIM index). Following an announcement at the 2011 AGM, in January 2012 Tottenham Hotspur confirmed that the club had delisted its shares from the stock market, taking it into private ownership.
Lewis' shares are owned by the Lewis Family Trusts. In October 2022, Lewis ceased to be a person with significant control of the club, following a reorganisation of the Trusts. The club continues to be owned by Levy and the Lewis trusts and, in the summer of 2022, ENIC intended to inject up to £150 million into the club by the issuing of new shares. Only £100 million of shares were subscribed for and this took ENIC's shareholding up to 86.58%.
Support.
Tottenham has a large fan base in the United Kingdom, drawn largely from North London and the <a href="Home%20counties">Home counties</a>. The attendance figures for its home matches, however, have fluctuated over the years. Five times between 1950 and 1962, Tottenham had the highest average attendance in England. Tottenham was 9th in average attendances for the 2008–09 Premier League season, and 11th for all Premier League seasons. In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a> when Tottenham used Wembley as its home ground, it had the second-highest attendance in the Premier League. It also holds the record for attendance in the Premier League, with 83,222 attending the <a href="North%20London%20derby">North London derby</a> on 10 February 2018. Historical supporters of the club have included such figures as philosopher <a href="A.%20J.%20Ayer">A. J. Ayer</a>. There are many official supporters' clubs located around the world, while an independent supporters club, the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust, is officially recognised by the club as the representative body for Spurs supporters.
Historically, the club had a significant <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> following from the Jewish communities in east and north London, with around a third of its supporters estimated to be Jewish in the 1930s. Due to this early support, all three chairmen of the club since 1984 have been Jewish businessmen with prior history of supporting the club. The club no longer has a greater Jewish contingent among its fans than other major London clubs (Jewish supporters are estimated to form at most 5% of its fanbase), though it is nevertheless still identified as a Jewish club by rival fans. <a href="antisemitism">Antisemitic</a> chants directed at the club and its supporters by rival fans have been heard since the 1960s, with words such as "<a href="Yids">Yids</a>" or "Yiddos" used against Tottenham supporters. In response to the abusive chants, Tottenham supporters, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, began to chant back the insults and adopt the "Yids" or "Yid Army" identity starting from around the late 1970s or early 1980s. Some fans view adopting "Yid" as a badge of pride, helping defuse its power as an insult. The use of "Yid" as a self-identification, however, has been controversial; some argued that the word is offensive and its use by Spurs fans "legitimis[es] references to Jews in football", and that such racist abuse should be stamped out in football. Both the <a href="World%20Jewish%20Congress">World Jewish Congress</a> and the <a href="Board%20of%20Deputies%20of%20British%20Jews">Board of Deputies of British Jews</a> have denounced the use of the word by fans. Others, such as former Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a>, argued that its use by the Spurs fans is not motivated by hate as it is not used pejoratively, and therefore cannot be considered hate speech. Attempts to prosecute Tottenham fans who chanted the words have failed, as the <a href="Crown%20Prosecution%20Service">Crown Prosecution Service</a> considered that the words as used by Tottenham fans could not be judged legally "threatening, abusive or insulting".
Fan culture.
There are a number of songs associated with the club and frequently sung by Spurs fans, such as "<a href="Glory%20Glory%20%28football%20chant%29">Glory Glory Tottenham Hotspur</a>". The song originated in 1961 after Spurs completed the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">Double</a> in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.%20season">1960–61</a>, and the club entered the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> for the first time. Their first opponents were <a href="G%C3%B3rnik%20Zabrze">Górnik Zabrze</a>, the Polish champions, and after a hard-fought match Spurs suffered a 4–2 reverse. Tottenham's tough tackling prompted the Polish press to write that "they were no angels". These comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at White Hart Lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into <a href="togas">togas</a>, sandals, false beards and carrying placards bearing <a href="biblical">biblical</a>-type slogans. The angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of "<a href="Glory%20Glory%20%28football%20chant%29">Glory Glory Hallelujah</a>", which is still sung on terraces at White Hart Lane and other football grounds. The Lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie 8–1. Then manager of Spurs, Bill Nicholson, wrote in his autobiography: 
There had been a number of incidents of <a href="hooliganism">hooliganism</a> involving Spurs fans, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. Significant events include the rioting by Spurs fans in <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> at the <a href="1974%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">1974 UEFA Cup Final</a> against <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a>, and again during the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20UEFA%20Cup">1983–84 UEFA Cup</a> matches against Feyenoord in Rotterdam and <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a> in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. Although fan violence has since abated, the occasional incidence of hooliganism continues to be reported.
Rivalries.
Tottenham supporters have rivalries with several clubs, mainly within the London area. The fiercest of these is with <a href="North%20London%20derby">north London rivals</a> Arsenal. The rivalry began in 1913 when Arsenal moved from the <a href="Manor%20Ground%2C%20Plumstead">Manor Ground</a>, <a href="Plumstead">Plumstead</a> to <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Arsenal Stadium</a>, <a href="Highbury">Highbury</a>, and this rivalry intensified in 1919 when Arsenal were unexpectedly promoted to the First Division, taking a place that Tottenham believed should have been theirs.
Tottenham also share notable rivalries with fellow London clubs <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="West%20Ham%20United">West Ham United</a>. The rivalry with <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> is secondary in importance to the one with Arsenal and began when Tottenham beat Chelsea in the <a href="1967%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1967 FA Cup Final</a>, the first ever all-London final. West Ham fans view Tottenham as a bitter rival, although the animosity is not reciprocated to the same extent by Tottenham fans.
Social responsibility.
The club through its Community Programme has, since 2006, been working with <a href="Haringey%20Council">Haringey Council</a> and the <a href="Metropolitan%20Housing%20Trust">Metropolitan Housing Trust</a> and the local community on developing sports facilities and social programmes which have also been financially supported by Barclays Spaces for Sport and the Football Foundation. The Tottenham Hotspur Foundation received high-level political support from the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">prime minister</a> when it was launched at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a> in February 2007.
In March 2007 the club announced a partnership with the charity <a href="SOS%20Children%27s%20Villages%20UK">SOS Children's Villages UK</a>, whereby player fines would go towards this charity's children's village in Rustenburg, South Africa to support of a variety of community development projects in and around Rustenburg. In the financial year 2006–07, Tottenham topped a league of Premier League charitable donations when viewed both in overall terms and as a percentage of turnover by giving £4,545,889, including a one-off contribution of £4.5 million over four years, to set up the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation.
In contrast, they have successfully sought the reduction of section 106 planning obligations connected to the redevelopment of the stadium in the Northumberland Development Project. Initially the development would incorporate 50% affordable housing, but this requirement was later waived, and a payment of £16m for community infrastructure was reduced to £0.5m. This is controversial in an area which has suffered high levels of deprivation as Spurs had bought up properties for redevelopment, removing existing jobs and businesses for property development but not creating enough new jobs for the area. The club however argued that the project, when completed, would support 3,500 jobs and inject an estimated £293 million into the local economy annually, and that it would serve as the catalyst for a wider 20-year regeneration programme for the Tottenham area. In other developments in Tottenham, the club has built 256 affordable homes and a 400-pupil primary school.
London Academy of Excellence.
As part of the development of Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the club built an elite educational facility to sit alongside its club offices. The <a href="London%20Academy%20of%20Excellence%20Tottenham">London Academy of Excellence Tottenham</a> (LAET) is a state-funded Sixth Form, sponsored by the Club and <a href="Highgate%20School">Highgate School</a> - the principle academic sponsors who deliver expert teaching. LAET was named the Sunday Times Sixth Form College of the Year, 2020 by Parent Power, The Sunday Times School Guide. In 2022, LAET achieved an 'Outstanding' <a href="Ofsted">Ofsted</a> rating across all areas.
Environmental sustainability.
Spurs are one of the high-profile participants in the project, which they joined in 2009. In a year, the carbon emissions were reduced by 14%, an estimated 400 tonnes of carbon. The club further said it is dedicated to minimising the environmental impact of its activities across all operations, setting targets to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 and become net-zero by 2040.
In September 2021, the club partnered with <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a> to host the world's first net-zero carbon top-level football game. The initiative won in the Sustainability category at the 2022 Football Business Awards. In 2023, the club was ranked top in Premier League's "Sustainability Rankings" for fourth year running.

Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.

Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club ( ), commonly referred to simply as Brighton, is an English professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in the city of <a href="Brighton%20and%20Hove">Brighton and Hove</a>. They compete in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the top tier of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. The club's home ground is the 31,876-capacity <a href="Falmer%20Stadium">Falmer Stadium</a> in <a href="Falmer">Falmer</a>, in the north east of <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>.
Founded in 1901 and nicknamed the "Seagulls" or "<a href="Albion">Albion</a>", Brighton played their early professional football in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>, before being elected to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1920. Prior to the current, continuing stint in the Premier League, the club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> and reached the <a href="1983%20FA%20Cup%20final">1983 FA Cup final</a>, losing to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> after a replay. They were <a href="relegated">relegated</a> from the First Division in the same season.
By the late 1990s, Brighton were in the fourth tier of English football and were having financial problems. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the <a href="National%20League%20%28English%20football%29">Conference</a> in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotions</a> in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20EFL%20Championship">2016–17 season</a>, Brighton finished second in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a> and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight. In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Premier%20League">2022–23 season</a>, Brighton finished sixth in the Premier League, their highest top flight finish ever, and qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>; this is their first participation in European football.
History.
Formation and early years (1901–1972).
Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>'s new <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> – having previously been members of the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>. In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a>, which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> in 1910. Following their switch to the regionalised division three south in 1921, they remained in this division until the 1957–1958 season, when they won the title and secured promotion to the Second Division at the same time as the regionalised north and south divisions de-regionalised into a third and fourth division for the 1958–1959 season. Albion retained their second tier status until relegation in 1962, suffering a successive relegation in 1963 and slipping into the fourth division for the first time. They won the fourth division title in 1964–1965 and remained in the third division until 1972 when as runners up they secured promotion back to the second division.
Mike Bamber years (1972–1987).
<a href="Mike%20Bamber">Mike Bamber</a> was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought <a href="Brian%20Clough">Brian Clough</a> to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player <a href="Alan%20Mullery">Alan Mullery</a> as manager. Brighton's life as a <a href="the%20Football%20League">Football League</a> club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promoted</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> as <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> <a href="runners-up">runners-up</a>. The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. <a href="Jimmy%20Melia">Jimmy Melia</a> took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.
Despite their relegation, that season Brighton reached their first (and only to date) <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> final and drew 2–2 with Manchester United in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by <a href="Gordon%20Smith%20%28footballer%20born%20December%201954%29">Gordon Smith</a> and <a href="Gary%20Stevens%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201962%29">Gary Stevens</a>. The final featured an infamous "miss" by Gordon Smith with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time, prompting the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> commentator Peter Jones to utter the well-known phrase "...and Smith must score". However, Smith's kick was saved by the Manchester United goalkeeper, <a href="Gary%20Bailey">Gary Bailey</a>. In the replay, Manchester United won 4–0.
Relegation, last years, and saved by Knight (1987–1997).
After four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion were promoted back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3–1, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two. In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three. The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the <a href="Goldstone%20Ground">Goldstone Ground</a> would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's large debts. Manager <a href="Jimmy%20Case">Jimmy Case</a> was sacked, after a very poor start to the 1996–97 season left Brighton at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin. The club's directors appointed <a href="Steve%20Gritt">Steve Gritt</a>, the former joint manager of <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>, as manager—Gritt was relatively unknown. Brighton's league performance steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction by the <a href="Football%20Association">Football Association</a>, imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the <a href="Goldstone%20Ground">Goldstone ground</a>. A lifelong fan named <a href="Dick%20Knight%20%28businessman%29">Dick Knight</a> took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers.
By the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they had risen from the bottom of the division table and had to play the team directly below them, <a href="Hereford%20United%20F.C.">Hereford United</a>, to retain their position in the league. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender <a href="Kerry%20Mayo">Kerry Mayo</a> scored an own goal in the first half, and it appeared that Brighton's 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from <a href="Robbie%20Reinelt">Robbie Reinelt</a> ensured that Brighton retained their league status, based on number of goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford's 25-year league run was instead over.
Withdean era and Bloom takeover (1997–2011).
The sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's <a href="Priestfield%20Stadium">Priestfield stadium</a> for two seasons. <a href="Micky%20Adams">Micky Adams</a> was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999. For the start of the 1999–2000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at <a href="Withdean%20Stadium">Withdean Stadium</a>, a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the <a href="Local%20government%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">local council</a>. 2000–01 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three</a> and promoted to <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a>. Adams left in October 2001 to work as <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a>'s assistant at <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester</a>, being replaced by former Leicester manager <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%20born%201953%29">Peter Taylor</a>. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a> champions – winning a second successive <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a>. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their <a href="the%20Football%20League">Football League</a> status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>.
In May 2009, Knight was replaced as chairman at Brighton by <a href="Tony%20Bloom">Tony Bloom</a>, who successfully secured £93 million funding for the new <a href="Falmer%20Stadium">Falmer Stadium</a> and 75% shareholding at the club.
Brighton's final season at <a href="Withdean%20Stadium">Withdean</a> was 2010–11, in which they won <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> under the management of <a href="Gus%20Poyet">Gus Poyet</a>. The following season, Brighton changed their crest to a design similar to the crest used from the 1970s to the 1990s. This was to reflect on the club returning home after not having a stadium since 1997.
Move to new stadium and promotion under Hughton (2011–2017).
The <a href="Falmer%20Stadium">Falmer Stadium</a> hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011–12 season against <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a>, who were the last opposition to play at the <a href="Goldstone%20Ground">Goldstone</a> in 1997. The game finished 2–1 to Brighton. The 2012–13 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview, and was later sacked as manager and replaced by <a href="%C3%93scar%20Garc%C3%ADa%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201973%29">Óscar García</a>.
On the final day of the 2013–14 season, Brighton beat <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> 2–1 with a last minute winner from <a href="Leonardo%20Ulloa">Leonardo Ulloa</a> to secure a 6th-place finish. After losing to <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> in the play-offs semi-finals, García resigned. <a href="Sami%20Hyypi%C3%A4">Sami Hyypiä</a> was appointed manager for the 2014–15 season but resigned after just four months due to a poor run of results, replaced by <a href="Chris%20Hughton">Chris Hughton</a>. In the following campaign Brighton challenged for promotion again, buoyed by a 21-game unbeaten run from the opening day to 19 December. On the final day of the season Brighton travelled to Middlesbrough and needed to win to secure promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, but a 1–1 draw meant 3rd and a play-off place, where defeat to <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> was Brighton's third playoff semi-final defeat in four seasons.
Brighton started 2016–17 with an 18-match unbeaten run, taking them to the top of the league for much of December and January. They remained in the automatic promotion positions for most of the rest of the season, and clinched promotion to the Premier League after a 2–1 win against Wigan Athletic at home on 17 April 2017.
Back in the top division (2017–present).
Brighton's first season in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season. After being one point above the relegation zone in January, victories over Arsenal and Manchester United in the final months of the campaign helped secure a finish of 15th.
The club endured a difficult second season in the top division, narrowly avoiding relegation with a 17th-place finish. In the FA Cup, Brighton reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1983, losing 1–0 to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Hughton was sacked following the end of the season due to the poor run of results.
Following Hughton's sacking, <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a> manager <a href="Graham%20Potter">Graham Potter</a> was appointed as the new head coach on a four-year contract. Potter extended his contract by two more years in November 2019. From March to June 2020, the season was suspended due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Brighton finished 15th and 16th in Potter's first two seasons, securing a historic fifth season in the Premier League in May 2021 that ensured their current spell in the top flight exceeded their previous run from 1979 to 1983.
The club's <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.%20season">2021–22 season</a> saw a ninth-place finish in the Premier League, the highest Brighton had ever finished in English top flight football, with a record tally of 51 points. In September 2022, Potter left the club to become head coach of <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, following the dismissal of <a href="Thomas%20Tuchel">Thomas Tuchel</a>.
On 18 September 2022, Brighton announced <a href="Roberto%20De%20Zerbi">Roberto De Zerbi</a> as the club's new head coach. The league season was paused for the <a href="2022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2022 FIFA World Cup</a>, in which Brighton midfielder <a href="Alexis%20Mac%20Allister">Alexis Mac Allister</a> started and assisted in the <a href="2022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20final">final</a> for winning side <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>. Brighton reached their second FA Cup semi-final in four seasons, losing on penalties to Manchester United following a 0–0 draw. On 21 May 2023, Brighton qualified for European football for the first time in their history with a 3–1 victory over <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. Three days later, after a 1–1 draw with Manchester City, Brighton secured qualification for the group stage of the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2023–24 UEFA Europa League</a>. Brighton finished the season with a record tally of 62 points and a new record of sixth-place.
On 14 December 2023, Brighton topped their Europa League group and qualified for the round of 16 by defeating <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a> 1–0.
Stadium.
Goldstone Ground.
For 95 years Brighton and Hove Albion were based at the <a href="Goldstone%20Ground">Goldstone Ground</a> in <a href="Hove">Hove</a>, until the board of directors decided to sell the stadium. The sale, implemented by majority shareholder <a href="Bill%20Archer%20%28businessman%29">Bill Archer</a> and his chief executive <a href="David%20Bellotti">David Bellotti</a>, proved controversial, and the move provoked widespread protests against the board. The club received little if any money from this sale.
In their last season at the Goldstone, <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Football%20League">1996–97</a>, the Seagulls were in danger of relegation from the <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a>. They won their final game at the Goldstone against <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a>, setting up a winner-takes-all relegation game at <a href="Hereford%20United%20F.C.">Hereford United</a>, who were level on points with the Seagulls. Brighton drew 1–1, and Hereford were relegated to the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a> on goals scored.
Withdean Stadium.
For two years, from 1997 to 1999, the club shared <a href="Priestfield%20Stadium">Priestfield Stadium</a>, the ground of <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a>, before returning to Brighton to play at <a href="Withdean%20Stadium">Withdean Stadium</a>. This is not predominantly a football ground, having been used for athletics throughout most of its history, and previously as a <a href="zoo">zoo</a>.
Because of the cost of the public enquiry into planning permission for a new stadium, rent on <a href="Withdean%20Stadium">Withdean Stadium</a>, fees paid to use <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham's</a> <a href="Priestfield%20Stadium">Priestfield Stadium</a>, and a general running deficit due to the low ticket sales inherent with a small ground, the club had an accumulated deficit of £9.5 million in 2004. The board of directors paid £7 million of this; the other £2.5 million had to be raised from the operations of the club. In an effort to achieve this, a fund-raising appeal known as the "Alive and Kicking Fund" was started, with everything from nude <a href="Christmas%20Card">Christmas Card</a>s featuring the players to a CD single being released to raise cash. On 9 January 2005 this fund-raising single '<a href="Tom%20Hark%20%28We%20Want%20Falmer%29">Tom Hark</a>' went straight in at number 17 in the UK chart, gaining it national airplay on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>.
Falmer Stadium.
The club's home ground is <a href="Falmer%20Stadium">Falmer Stadium</a>, currently known for sponsorship reasons as the American Express Stadium or simply, the Amex, located in Village Way, Brighton.
On 28 October 2005, the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Deputy%20Prime%20Minister">Office of the Deputy Prime Minister</a> announced that the application for Falmer had been successful, much to the joy and relief of all the fans. <a href="Lewes%20%28district%29">Lewes District Council</a> contested <a href="John%20Prescott">John Prescott</a>'s decision to approve planning permission for Falmer, forcing a <a href="judicial%20review">judicial review</a>. This was based on a minor error in Prescott's original approval which neglected to state that some car parking for the stadium is in the Lewes district as opposed to the Brighton & Hove unitary authority. This caused further delay. Once the judicial review ruled in favour of the stadium, Lewes District Council said that it would not launch any further appeals.
Building of Falmer Stadium started in December 2008. On 31 May 2011 the club officially completed the handover and was given the keys to the stadium with an initial capacity of 22,374 seats, signifying the end of 14 years without a designated home. During January 2012, the club submitted an application to Brighton and Hove City council to increase the stadium capacity by a further 8,000 seats as well as to add additional corporate boxes, new television facilities and a luxury suite. This was granted unanimously by Brighton & Hove City Council's planning committee on 25 April 2012. The stadium was then expanded to 27,250 for the start of the 2012–13 season and then further to 27,750 during December 2012 before reaching 30,750 during May 2013.
In 2020, the club submitted plans to expand the stadium from 30,750 seats to 32,500 including additional hospitality. In 2021, the stadium was expanded to 31,800 with additional works yet to be done.

Even though the two clubs are almost apart, <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> are Brighton's <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.%E2%80%93Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.%20rivalry">main rival</a>, dating back to the 1970s and hostility between managers <a href="Alan%20Mullery">Alan Mullery</a> and <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a>, who took charge of Brighton and Palace respectively in 1976 ahead of a close season in the <a href="EFL%20League%20One">Third Division</a> which saw the two teams vying with <a href="Mansfield%20Town%20F.C.">Mansfield Town</a>. The season finished with both Palace and Brighton beaten to the title by Mansfield; however both sides were promoted and the hostility between the two managers had forged an intense rivalry between both teams. This continued into the following season in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Second Division</a> as Brighton, who had finished their season at the top, fell into second after Palace won a previously postponed game against Burnley the following weekend to beat Brighton to the title by one point. In addition, the <a href="A23%20road">A23 road</a> runs directly between Brighton and Croydon, where Palace's <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a> stadium is based. This has led to the media labelling the rivalry as both the A23 and <a href="M23%20motorway">M23</a> derby, although fans of both clubs do not use this term.
Situated in <a href="East%20Sussex">East Sussex</a>, Brighton find themselves isolated from most other teams, leaving them without an established <a href="List%20of%20sports%20rivalries%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23England">local derby</a>. Matches against fellow south coast outfits <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> and <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> are occasionally labelled as local derbies by the media, but most fans of either team do not consider the other to be their rivals due to the over distance between the clubs, and the already <a href="South%20Coast%20derby">well-established rivalry between Southampton and Portsmouth</a>.
Players.
Under 21s and academy.
The Under-21s and Academy are the youth teams of Brighton & Hove Albion. The under-21 players play in the <a href="Professional%20Development%20League">Premier League 2</a>, the highest tier of under-21 team football in England. They also compete in the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">EFL Trophy</a> and the <a href="Premier%20League%20International%20Cup">Premier League International Cup</a>.
The academy teams culminate with the under-18's squad, who compete in the U18 Premier League Division South.

For most of Brighton's history they have played in blue & white shirts, usually striped, with different combinations of white and blue shorts and socks, though this changed to all white briefly in the 1970s and again to plain royal blue in the early 1980s, which coincided with the most successful spell up to that point in the club's history, only to be bettered four decades later.
Since 2014, the club's kit has been manufactured by <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>.

Wimbledon F.C.

Wimbledon Football Club was an English <a href="association%20football">football</a> club formed in <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a>, south-west <a href="London">London</a>, in 1889 and based at <a href="Plough%20Lane%20%281912%E2%80%9398%29">Plough Lane</a> from 1912 to 1991. Founded as Wimbledon Old Centrals, the club were a <a href="non-League%20football">non-League</a> team for most of their history. Nicknamed "the Dons" and latterly also "<a href="the%20Wombles">the Wombles</a>", they won eight <a href="Isthmian%20League">Isthmian League</a> titles, the <a href="FA%20Amateur%20Cup">FA Amateur Cup</a> in 1963 and three successive <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> championships between 1975 and 1977, and were then elected to <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>. The team rose quickly from obscurity during the 1980s and were <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promoted</a> to the then top-flight <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in 1986, just four seasons after being in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>.
Wimbledon's "<a href="Crazy%20Gang%20%28football%29">Crazy Gang</a>"—so-called because of the boisterous, eccentric behaviour of the players—won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final%201988">1988</a>, beating that season's League champions <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, and thereby became one of only three clubs to have won both the FA Cup and its amateur counterpart. In 1991, following the publication of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> recommending all-seater grounds for top-flight clubs, Wimbledon left Plough Lane to <a href="groundshare">groundshare</a> with nearby <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> at <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a>—an originally temporary arrangement that ended up lasting over a decade. The team remained in the First Division and its successor the <a href="Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a> until they were <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> in 2000.
In 2001, after rejecting a variety of possible local sites and others further afield, the club announced its intention to <a href="Relocation%20of%20Wimbledon%20F.C.%20to%20Milton%20Keynes">move</a> north to <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>. The idea of Wimbledon leaving south London was deeply unpopular, both with the bulk of the club's established fanbase and with football supporters generally, but an independent commission appointed by <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> granted permission in May 2002. A group of supporters, appalled by the decision, responded by forming a new club, <a href="AFC%20Wimbledon">AFC Wimbledon</a>, to which the majority of Wimbledon FC fans switched allegiance.
History.
Non-League beginnings.
Wimbledon Old Central Football Club were formed in 1889, taking its name from the <a href="Old%20Central%20School">Old Central School</a> on <a href="Wimbledon%20and%20Putney%20Commons">Wimbledon Common</a> where players had been pupils. The club's first match was a 1–0 victory over Westminster, and it only took seven years for success to come to Wimbledon as the club won both the Clapham League and the Herald League in <a href="1895%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1895–96</a>. Wimbledon won the Clapham League again in <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">1900–01</a>, as well as two minor trophies. A meeting was convened on 1 May 1905, and the decision was taken to drop "Old Central" from the club's name – the club became Wimbledon Football Club, and under its new name the club won the South London Charity Cup the same year – however, excessive debts caused the club to fold in 1910. The club was restarted a year later under the name Wimbledon Borough, though "Borough" was dropped from the team's name after barely a year. The club continued to play on Wimbledon Common and at various other locations in the Wimbledon area until 1912, when the side settled at <a href="Plough%20Lane%20%281912%E2%80%9398%29">Plough Lane</a>. Wimbledon joined the <a href="Athenian%20League">Athenian League</a> for <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20</a>, and in the second season in its new division finished as runners-up. The club then joined the <a href="Isthmian%20League">Isthmian League</a>. Winning four Isthmian League titles during the 1930s, and reaching the <a href="FA%20Amateur%20Cup">FA Amateur Cup</a> final in <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20in%20English%20football">1934–35</a>, Wimbledon began to prosper. The club reached another FA Amateur Cup final in <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20in%20English%20football">1946–47</a>, and finished as runners-up in the league twice over the next few seasons.
Wimbledon won the Isthmian League for the fifth time in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a> before starting a period of domination that saw three successive championships – <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20in%20English%20football">1961–62</a>, <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1962–63</a> and <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20in%20English%20football">1963–64</a>. Wimbledon also lifted the FA Amateur Cup in 1962–63, beating <a href="Sutton%20United%20F.C.">Sutton United</a> 4–2: the club's all-time top goalscorer, <a href="Eddie%20Reynolds">Eddie Reynolds</a>, scored all four Wimbledon goals with his head, and in doing so became the only player to have headed in all four of his side's goals in a <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> match – as of 2012, still a unique feat. Following these successes the decision was taken to turn professional for the <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20in%20English%20football">1964–65</a> season and to enter the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>. Wimbledon had continued success in their new league, finishing as runners-up at the first attempt. Wimbledon became nationally famous during an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> run during the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75</a> season: entering the competition at the first qualifying round, Wimbledon saw off first <a href="Bracknell%20Town%20F.C.">Bracknell Town</a>, then <a href="Maidenhead%20United%20F.C.">Maidenhead United</a>, <a href="Wokingham%20%26amp%3B%20Emmbrook%20F.C.">Wokingham Town</a>, <a href="Dorking%20F.C.">Guildford & Dorking United</a>, <a href="Bath%20City%20F.C.">Bath City</a> and <a href="Kettering%20Town%20F.C.">Kettering Town</a> to find themselves in the third round proper. They then became the first <a href="non-League%20football">non-League</a> team that century to beat a <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> side away from home by defeating <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> at <a href="Turf%20Moor">Turf Moor</a>. In the fourth round the good form continued, as the team held the reigning First Division <a href="English%20football%20champions">champions</a> <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> to a 0–0 draw at <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a>. <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">Goalkeeper</a> <a href="Dickie%20Guy">Dickie Guy</a> saved a penalty from <a href="Peter%20Lorimer">Peter Lorimer</a> to earn a replay, which was narrowly lost 1–0 by an <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> in front of over 40,000 spectators at <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a>. After winning the Southern League three times running from <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75</a> to <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77</a>, Wimbledon were elected to <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> in place of <a href="Workington%20F.C.">Workington</a> for the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Football%20League">1977–78</a> season.
The Football League.
The <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20in%20English%20football">1977–78</a> season was a satisfactory Football League debut for Wimbledon, who finished 13th in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>. <a href="Allen%20Batsford">Allen Batsford</a> had resigned as manager on 2 January 1978 to be succeeded by <a href="Dario%20Gradi">Dario Gradi</a>, who guided the club to promotion in <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20in%20English%20football">1978–79</a>. Wimbledon's first stay in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> was not a successful one. The team struggled, and were <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> in bottom place, winning just 10 league games all season. Following relegation, <a href="Relocation%20of%20Wimbledon%20F.C.%20to%20Milton%20Keynes">relocation</a> to <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> was considered – chairman <a href="Ron%20Noades">Ron Noades</a> entered talks with the <a href="Milton%20Keynes%20Development%20Corporation">Milton Keynes Development Corporation</a> about the possibility of moving the club to the <a href="new%20towns%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">new town</a>, but the plan was never executed.
Still in south <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20in%20English%20football">1980–81</a> saw Wimbledon regain Third Division status at the first attempt, at the end of an eventful season which saw chairman Ron Noades walk out of the club to take over <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>, taking manager Dario Gradi to <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a> with him. At <a href="Plough%20Lane%20%281912%E2%80%9398%29">Plough Lane</a>, assistant manager <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a> was promoted to manager. Under Bassett, Wimbledon were relegated in 22nd place. Just before the survival battle was lost, injured defender <a href="Dave%20Clement">Dave Clement</a> committed <a href="suicide">suicide</a>. Wimbledon once again regained Third Division status at the first time of asking, triumphing as Fourth Division champions in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1982–83</a>, and in <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20in%20English%20football">the next season</a> the Wimbledon players continued to excel as they achieved a second promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> after finishing runners-up with 97 league goals.
<a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85</a> was Wimbledon's first season in the Second Division, and everyone at the club was prepared for long and hard struggle to preserve this status. A 12th-place finish was more than satisfactory for a club that was playing at this level for the first time. The next year started well for Wimbledon as <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> were defeated 3–0 on the opening day of the season – the team was soon looking like a contender for <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a>. Promotion in third place was sealed on the final day of the season with an away victory at <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>. Thus, Wimbledon had reached the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, only four years after playing in the Fourth Division and nine years after being elected into The Football League.
The top flight.
Many observers tipped Wimbledon to go straight back down in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87</a>, but after losing the first game of the season away at <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, Wimbledon won the next four games to perch atop the league table on 1 September. Wimbledon eventually finished sixth, before Dave Bassett moved on to <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>. His successor was <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a> manager <a href="Bobby%20Gould">Bobby Gould</a>. Dubbed "<a href="Crazy%20Gang%20%28football%29">The Crazy Gang</a>" because of the eccentric behaviour of its players, fans and chairman, <a href="Sam%20Hammam">Sam Hammam</a>, the club's greatest moment came in 1988 when, very much against expectation, the team won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, beating overwhelming favourites <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> <a href="1988%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1–0</a> with a goal from <a href="Lawrie%20Sanchez">Lawrie Sanchez</a>. 37,000 Wimbledon fans witnessed <a href="captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> <a href="Dave%20Beasant">Dave Beasant</a> becoming the first <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> to save a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a> in an FA Cup final, stopping <a href="John%20Aldridge">John Aldridge</a>'s shot. The only downside of this triumph was the fact that the club would not be able to compete in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, as the ban on English teams from European competition following the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20Disaster">Heysel Stadium Disaster</a> was still in operation at this time.
Just days after the FA Cup triumph, Wimbledon directors announced plans to build a new <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a> in the club's home borough of <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Merton">Merton</a>. In the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">season following the FA Cup triumph</a>, Gould steered Wimbledon to a secure 12th-place finish in the First Division, and in <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1989–90</a> the side finished eighth. Despite these successes, Bobby Gould was replaced by <a href="Ray%20Harford">Ray Harford</a> in 1990, who in <a href="1988%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">the same year as Wimbledon's FA Cup triumph</a> had guided <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> to victory in the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>. Under Harford's management, <a href="Warren%20Barton">Warren Barton</a> was purchased for £300,000 while Wimbledon had another strong season in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1990–91</a>, finishing seventh.
Nothing came of the plans for a new ground and at the end of <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1990–91</a> the club's board decided that <a href="Plough%20Lane%20%281912%E2%80%9398%29">Plough Lane</a> was beyond redevelopment to meet the new <a href="The%20Football%20Association">FA</a> rule requiring all-seater stadiums. Consequently, the club moved to <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a> before the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92</a> season, <a href="groundshare">ground-sharing</a> with <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>. Harford suddenly resigned in October 1991, to be replaced by <a href="Peter%20Withe">Peter Withe</a>. Withe lasted until just after the turn of the new year, when <a href="Joe%20Kinnear">Joe Kinnear</a> was promoted from the role of youth team coach, initially taking over as interim manager. After guiding Wimbledon to 13th place in the First Division and booking a place in the inaugural <a href="Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a>, Kinnear got the manager's job on a permanent basis.
<a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a> began as a struggle for Wimbledon – the club were third from bottom on <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a>. However, the team recovered well in the new year and finished 12th. <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">The next season</a> was one of Wimbledon's best seasons to date as the side finished sixth in the FA Premier League and reached the quarter-finals of the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>. Wimbledon remained hard to beat in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95</a>, finishing ninth in the league. During the close season the Dons made their first and only appearance in a <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> European competition, being required by the FA to enter the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a>. However, after fielding an under-strength side containing reserves, youth team players and unsigned trialists in their group stage games, the club – along with <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> – were banned from European competition for the following season. Not that it mattered; after losing Barton to Newcastle, <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96</a> saw a drop to 14th. Wimbledon made a fine start to the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1996–97</a> campaign – after losing the first three fixtures, the players proceeded to win their next seven and reach second place in the FA Premier League. There was delight in early February when they eliminated <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> from the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> – Wimbledon reached both the FA Cup <a href="FA%20Cup%20Semi-finals">semi-finals</a> and the semi-finals of the League Cup. Wimbledon's last hope of qualifying for European competition now lay with a challenge for a top-five league finish, but the team could only manage eighth.
Relegation and relocation.
The <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a> season looked highly promising for Wimbledon as late on as <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, as the team were regularly in the top five. However, the side's form in the second half of the season was less impressive, and the club dipped to 15th place in the final table – the lowest finish yet for Wimbledon in the top flight. A similar pattern followed in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1998–99</a> – a good start followed by a slump. As late on as mid-March, the team were on the fringe of a <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> place. The club record signing of <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> striker <a href="John%20Hartson">John Hartson</a> boosted hopes of success for Wimbledon, but a terrible run of form in the final weeks of the season saw the side dip to 16th in the final table. Wimbledon again reached the League Cup semi-finals that season – losing to eventual winners <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>.
Joe Kinnear stepped down as manager in June 1999 due to ill health, and was succeeded by Norwegian coach <a href="Egil%20Olsen">Egil Olsen</a>. Wimbledon reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup, but the team's league form slowly deteriorated during the second half of the season. Olsen left in early May with the club threatened by relegation. Long-serving coach <a href="Terry%20Burton">Terry Burton</a> took over, but on 14 May 2000, 12 years to the day after the FA Cup win, the side was <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> from the top flight after 14 years after a 2–0 defeat at <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> and 1–0 win for <a href="Bradford%20City%20F.C.">Bradford City</a> over <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Burton remained manager of Wimbledon for two seasons in the second tier before he was sacked at the end of <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">2001–02</a> after the club had narrowly missed out on the promotion play-offs two seasons in a row.
Relocation, renaming, and foundation of AFC Wimbledon.
In August 2001, the club announced its intent to relocate to <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a>. Despite opposition from Wimbledon fans, <a href="English%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, and <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a>, they were given permission to do so on 28 May 2002 after a 2–1 vote by the three-person, independent commission appointed by the F.A. The approval of the decision to move the club caused supporters who were against the move to found a new club, <a href="AFC%20Wimbledon">AFC Wimbledon</a>, to which most Wimbledon fans switched their allegiance;
gates at the new club were over 3,500, compared with 2,500 or less for the relocated club.
Goalkeeping coach <a href="Stuart%20Murdoch%20%28football%20manager%29">Stuart Murdoch</a> was promoted to manager, and as attendances plummeted, Murdoch's team finished 10th in the league during the club's last full season at Selhurst Park. Wimbledon entered <a href="administration%20%28law%29">administration</a> in June 2003, and played their first match in <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> in September. Although crowds attending the club's games at its new base were bigger than those at Wimbledon, the administrator in charge of the club's financial affairs sold any player who could command a transfer fee and Murdoch's team finished at the bottom of the league.
The club were brought out of administration at the end of the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">2003–04 season</a>, and "<a href="Milton%20Keynes%20Dons%20F.C.">Milton Keynes Dons</a>". was formed in the club's place.
Club identity.
The club's nickname was the Dons, though the club were also often referred to in the media as <a href="the%20Wombles">the Wombles</a> from the mid-1970s onwards. Following the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> victory in 1988, the term <a href="Crazy%20Gang%20%28football%29">Crazy Gang</a> also started to be applied; originally to the players, though over time to the club as a whole. The club introduced a character mascot in 2000, a Womble named Wandle the Womble. However, following the relocation of the club in 2003, the owners of the Wombles brand refused to renew the licensing agreement in protest at the move. Three years later, a deal was agreed that saw a similar character named Haydon the Womble appear at <a href="AFC%20Wimbledon">AFC Wimbledon</a>.
The colours most associated with the club were blue and yellow. The club's first colours were navy blue and white, though the kit changed several times soon after the club's foundation, between combinations of: brown and blue striped shirts with navy blue shorts; green and white striped shirts with navy blue shorts; green shirts and black shorts; white shirts with navy blue shorts, and finally green and black striped shirts with black shorts. Royal blue shirts with navy blue shorts and socks were finally settled upon in 1918, initially bearing a "W" (for Wimbledon) in the centre of the chest. Wimbledon players then regularly wore royal blue shirts with black shorts and socks until a shift in the 1950s saw the shorts change from black to white. A combination of blue shirts, blue shorts and white socks was introduced in 1966, before being abandoned a year later in favour of an all-blue outfit. The white socks returned in 1970. A blue and yellow combination was first used in 1975, but was replaced after a year with an all-white outfit trimmed with blue, and this was the kit in which the club played its first season in the Football League. In 1978, Yellow shirts, blue shorts and yellow socks were adopted, before the club made the change to an all-blue strip with yellow markings in 1981. The kit underwent only minor changes until 1993, when a darker, deep navy blue replaced the royal blue shade that had been used for the previous twelve years. Wimbledon wore these colours for the remainder of their history. As for <a href="kit%20%28association%20football%29">change colours</a>, a red kit, with black trim, was a frequent choice in the 1990s. The club had a green away kit for the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a> season.
The first crest the club wore was the emblem of the <a href="Municipal%20Borough%20of%20Wimbledon">Municipal Borough of Wimbledon</a>. This emblem appeared on Wimbledon shirts from the late 1920s until the mid-1950s, when no badge was worn. The <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> returned in the early 1970s, before the club adopted its own badge on election to The Football League in 1977. The crest was very similar to the badge most commonly associated with the club – the difference being the inclusion of white rather than yellow. Yellow replaced white in 1981, and this logo was used until 2003. After the club's <a href="relocation%20of%20Wimbledon%20F.C.%20to%20Milton%20Keynes">relocation to Milton Keynes</a> was confirmed in May 2002, the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> informed the club in August 2002 that its continued use of the Borough arms was illegal. A replacement, given the go-ahead on 12 April 2003, featured a stylised eagle's head – an element from the Wimbledon arms – drawn in navy blue and yellow outline, the yellow forming a stylized rendering of the letters "MK" (for Milton Keynes). Despite being officially adopted in April 2003, the logo's use was inconsistent: the club officially announced that it would be used "on all club kit, merchandise and literature from the start of [the 2003–04] season", including on a new white away kit and on an amended version of the previous season's home outfit, but this never occurred; both the home and away colours from 2002 to 2003 were retained for the following year with the municipal arms still present. Moreover, the old crest continued to appear on official club statements and literature towards the end of the 2003–04 season, making the status of the new badge ambiguous at best.
Mascot.
From 2000 to June 2003, the original Wimbledon F.C. had used a <a href="The%20Wombles">Womble</a> mascot named "Wandle", named after the local <a href="River%20Wandle">River Wandle</a>, as a club mascot. However, in light of the controversy over the moving of the club to Milton Keynes, the legal licence to use the character was withdrawn by the Wombles' creator, <a href="Elisabeth%20Beresford">Elisabeth Beresford</a>, in protest at the nature of the club's relocation.
Stadium.
Wimbledon originally played on <a href="Wimbledon%20and%20Putney%20Commons">Wimbledon Common</a>, using the Fox and Grapes <a href="public%20house">public house</a> in Camp Road as the team's headquarters and changing room. The club moved to <a href="Plough%20Lane%20%281912%E2%80%9398%29">Plough Lane</a> in September 1912. During the 1930s and 1940s, crowds of between 7,000 and 10,000 were not uncommon at the ground. Wimbledon's highest attendance at the ground came on 2 March 1935, when 18,080 people were attracted to an <a href="FA%20Amateur%20Cup">FA Amateur Cup</a> tie against <a href="HMS%20Victory">HMS Victory</a>. <a href="floodlights%20%28sport%29">Floodlights</a> were first used on 3 October 1960 in a <a href="London%20Charity%20Cup">London Charity Cup</a> match against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>.
The Plough Lane ground remained comparatively basic, and by the time the club had risen to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> the stadium had not changed greatly from Wimbledon's recent non-league days. At the time of the club's acceptance into <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> in 1977, applicants had only to meet minimal stadium criteria, and once in the League these same criteria sufficed regardless of whether the club subsequently found itself in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth</a> or First Division. However, following the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> and the subsequent <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>, the football authorities introduced far stricter safety rules, which gave top-flight clubs specific deadlines by which to redevelop terraced grounds or to build new <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a>s. The board of the club decided that Plough Lane could not be made to comply with these new requirements economically and, in 1990, they announced plans to temporarily <a href="groundshare">groundshare</a> with <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> at their <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a> stadium.
Given the location of the Plough Lane ground, at the junction of two major roads and beside the <a href="River%20Wandle">River Wandle</a>, major redevelopment of the site as a modern all-seater stadium might have been difficult, though not impossible. The club's board of directors maintained that it had "searched exhaustively with Merton Council" for a site in or around <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Merton">Merton</a> on which to build a new stadium, looking at "14 different sites over a period of five years", in addition to commissioning feasibility studies for redeveloping both Plough Lane and the neighbouring site at <a href="Wimbledon%20Stadium">Wimbledon Stadium</a>. Despite this, nothing ever became of the board's continual promises to redevelop the site or to build a new ground within the borough, and the club remained as tenants at Selhurst Park for twelve years.
Wimbledon's first match at the <a href="National%20Hockey%20Stadium%20%28Milton%20Keynes%29">National Hockey Stadium</a> in <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> was played on 27 September 2003. The club remained there for the rest of <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">its final season</a>, and the ground became the first home of <a href="Milton%20Keynes%20Dons%20F.C.">Milton Keynes Dons</a>.
Supporters.
Due to <a href="Plough%20Lane%20%281912%E2%80%9398%29">Plough Lane</a>'s modest capacity and Wimbledon's unprecedented rise from <a href="non-League%20football">non-League football</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in under ten years, the club had a much lower level of support than its top-flight rivals. During Wimbledon's <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20in%20English%20football">first season</a> in <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, Wimbledon's average attendance was only 3,135 – however, by the club's appearance in the top flight <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">nine years later</a> the average attendance had risen by 149% to 7,811. Attendances did not immediately change much following the move to <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a> in 1991 – however, the larger capacity gradually started to be used. Average crowds peaked at 18,235 in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20in%20English%20football">1998–99</a>, and during the next season, the team's final year in the <a href="Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a>, home crowds averaged 17,157. With <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a>, attendances dropped to an average of only 7,897 during <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01</a> as organized supporter boycotts of matches in protest at the proposed relocation took effect. Wimbledon averaged 6,961 during the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">final season before</a> the club's <a href="Relocation%20of%20Wimbledon%20F.C.%20to%20Milton%20Keynes">relocation to Milton Keynes</a> was confirmed.
Following the sanctioning of the move, most of the team's support left, in specific protest at the club's relocation, to follow <a href="AFC%20Wimbledon">AFC Wimbledon</a>, the new club founded by Wimbledon supporters. During the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03</a> season, AFC Wimbledon's first and Wimbledon's last full season in south London, average crowds at the new club were actually higher than those at the original club. Attendances during the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> season, Wimbledon's last, were higher than those at AFC Wimbledon: Wimbledon averaged 4,751 at the National Hockey Stadium, compared to AFC Wimbledon's 2,606.
The club had two main supporters organisations– the long established official Wimbledon F.C. Supporters Club, which was tied to the club, and the more radical Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association (WISA) which was founded in 1995. The WISA was instrumental in the organisation of the supporter boycotts at Selhurst Park, and in the formation of <a href="The%20Dons%20Trust">The Dons Trust</a> in March 2002. This trust, created in part to oppose the relocation to Milton Keynes, helped the WISA to found <a href="AFC%20Wimbledon">AFC Wimbledon</a> months after its own establishment. Both the WISA and The Dons Trust from this point became affiliated to <a href="AFC%20Wimbledon">AFC Wimbledon</a>, while the official Wimbledon F.C Supporters Club became defunct following the relocation.
Rivalries.
During much of Wimbledon's amateur and later <a href="semi-professional">semi-professional</a> history, a strong local rivalry existed with neighbouring <a href="Tooting%20%26amp%3B%20Mitcham%20United%20F.C.">Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.</a>
From the mid 1980s, the club's main rivals were considered by fans to be fellow south <a href="London">London</a> club <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> (who were their landlord from 1991 to 2003) and west London-based <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>; however, neither of these rivalries was seriously reciprocated. Wimbledon were in the same division as Palace for a total of 11 seasons between 1984 and 2004, and in the same division as Chelsea for all but one season between 1986 and 2000.
Records and statistics.
The record for most appearances for Wimbledon was held by <a href="Roy%20Law">Roy Law</a>, who turned out for the club 644 times between 1958 and 1972; Law's 433 league appearances was also a record. Wimbledon's all-time top goalscorer was <a href="Eddie%20Reynolds">Eddie Reynolds</a>, who scored 340 goals in 329 matches between 1957 and 1966. The closest to Reynolds's record was <a href="Ian%20Cooke%20%28footballer%29">Ian Cooke</a>, who notched 297 between 1964 and 1977; Cooke also made the second highest total number of appearances for the team, having appeared 615 times in a Wimbledon shirt.
The records for most appearances and goals for Wimbledon in <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> were both held by <a href="Alan%20Cork">Alan Cork</a>. Cork scored 145 league goals for the club in 430 matches. Cork also held the record for most Football League goals in a season, with 29 during <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20in%20English%20football">1983–84</a>. Wimbledon's most capped player was <a href="Kenny%20Cunningham">Kenny Cunningham</a>, who was capped 16 times for the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland</a> during his time at the club. Wimbledon's most expensive signing was <a href="John%20Hartson">John Hartson</a>, for whom the club paid <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> £7.5 million on 15 January 1999.

Wimbledon's best win was a 6–0 league victory over <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a> on 3 September 1983, while the worst defeat was an 8–0 <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> defeat at <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> on 29 August 1978. Wimbledon's longest unbeaten league run was 22 matches between 15 January and 14 May 1984; the longest league run without a win, 14, was set between 19 March and 28 August 2000. Wimbledon's longest run of league wins was seven, set between 9 April and 7 May 1983 and matched from 4 September to 19 October 1996. Wimbledon's longest run of league defeats was the eleven matches lost in a row from 10 January to 27 March 2004.
Wimbledon's highest attendance, 30,115, was set on 9 May 1993 for the <a href="Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a> match against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> at <a href="Selhurst%20Park">Selhurst Park</a> but their official home attendance record is 18,080 vs HMS Victory in an FA Amateur Cup tie on 9 March 1935 at <a href="Plough%20Lane%20%281912%E2%80%9398%29">Plough Lane</a> due to Selhurst Park being borrowed from Crystal Palace FC.

Managers.
Prior to the appointment of H. R. Watts as first team manager in 1930, a committee would deal with first team affairs, such as choosing the team on a matchday. Doc Dowden was appointed manager in 1946, and stayed in the position until leaving at the end of the <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20in%20English%20football">1954–55</a> season. <a href="Les%20Henley">Les Henley</a> arrived in his place as first team coach, and stayed at the club for sixteen years in which the club progressed immensely, winning the <a href="FA%20Amateur%20Cup">FA Amateur Cup</a> as well as three <a href="Isthmian%20League">Isthmian League</a> championships before turning professional and moving to the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>. However, in 1971 Henley was replaced by <a href="Mike%20Everitt%20%28footballer%29">Mike Everitt</a>, who arrived as <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a>. After two seasons, Everitt left to manage <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> and <a href="Dick%20Graham">Dick Graham</a> arrived as a replacement. Graham remained until March 1974, and a replacement was not appointed until July of that year, when <a href="Allen%20Batsford">Allen Batsford</a> was made manager. Batsford led Wimbledon to <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, but resigned only halfway through the first League season. <a href="Dario%20Gradi">Dario Gradi</a> was made manager three days later, but after three seasons he too resigned. His replacement was <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a>, who took Wimbledon to sixth in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> before moving to <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>. <a href="Bobby%20Gould">Bobby Gould</a> spent three years as manager before being replaced by <a href="Ray%20Harford">Ray Harford</a>, who spent just over a season with Wimbledon. After Harford, <a href="Peter%20Withe">Peter Withe</a> had a spell as manager lasting only three months. <a href="Joe%20Kinnear">Joe Kinnear</a> was brought in during January 1992, and managed the club until leaving in 1999 due to ill health. A season was spent under <a href="Egil%20Olsen">Egil Olsen</a> in which the team was <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> from the <a href="Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a> before <a href="Terry%20Burton">Terry Burton</a> was made manager. Burton's Wimbledon narrowly missed the play-offs twice in a row before he was sacked. <a href="Stuart%20Murdoch%20%28football%20manager%29">Stuart Murdoch</a> managed Wimbledon for the club's final two seasons.

Honours.
Wimbledon were a successful club even before election to <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, winning eight <a href="Isthmian%20League">Isthmian League</a> titles (including three in a row from 1962 to 1964) and three successive <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> titles (from 1975 to 1977). Having also won the <a href="FA%20Amateur%20Cup">FA Amateur Cup</a> in 1963, the run of Southern League titles prompted Football League election in 1977.
Even at the higher level, Wimbledon continued to collect honours; the most notable being the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> victory in 1988, which made Wimbledon only the third club to have won both the FA Cup and its amateur equivalent. Despite swift success in The Football League, the club's rapid ascent combined with short spells in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second</a> and <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Divisions</a> meant that the team only won a solitary divisional championship within the League – the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> title of <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Football%20League">1982–83</a>.

Swindon Town Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Swindon">Swindon</a>, <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>, England. The team, known as the "Robins", currently compete in , the fourth level of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>.
Founded as Swindon AFC in 1879, the club became Spartans the next year, before finally settling on the name Swindon Town in 1883. It turned professional in 1894 as a founding member of the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>, later also entering the <a href="Western%20Football%20League">Western League</a> between 1897 and 1902. The club was crowned Western League champion in 1898–99 and Southern League champion in 1910–11 and 1913–14, before being elected into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1920. It remained in the third tier for 43 years, finally securing promotion into the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in 1962–63, where it remained for just two seasons. The team lifted the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> after beating <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the <a href="1969%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1969 final</a>, and went on to secure promotion at the end of the 1968–69 season with the help of talismanic winger <a href="Don%20Rogers%20%28footballer%29">Don Rogers</a>. Relegated again in 1973–74, the club dropped into the fourth tier for the first time at the end of the 1981–82 season.
Swindon won the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> title in 1985–86 and secured a second successive promotion the following season under the stewardship of <a href="Lou%20Macari">Lou Macari</a>. They went on to claim victory in the <a href="1990%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20final">1990 Second Division play-off final</a>, but were denied promotion into the top-flight after admitting to breaching Football League regulations. <a href="Glenn%20Hoddle">Glenn Hoddle</a> coached the team to victory in the <a href="1993%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20final">1993 play-off final</a> to finally secure a place in the top-flight for the first time in <a href="History%20of%20Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">the club's history</a>. However they were relegated out of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> at the end of the 1993–94 season and dropped into the third tier with a second consecutive relegation. Promoted again as champions to avoid an FA expulsion and a hat-trick of relegations in 1995–96, they remained in the second tier for four seasons until relegation in the 1999–2000 season. They dropped into the fourth tier <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> in the 2005–06 for the first time since 1986. Since then, Swindon have spent their time between the third and fourth tiers; earning promotion from League Two on three occasions.
Their home colours are red and white. Since 1896 the club has played home matches at the <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Swindon">County Ground</a>, which now has a capacity of 15,547.

History.
Early history.
Swindon Town Football Club was founded by Reverend William Pitt of <a href="Liddington">Liddington</a> in 1879. The team turned professional in 1894 and joined the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> which was founded in the same year. During this period <a href="Septimus%20Atterbury">Septimus Atterbury</a> played for the club.
Swindon reached the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-finals for the first time in the <a href="1909%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">1909–10</a> season, losing to eventual winners <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> and Swindon were invited to compete for the <a href="Dubonnet%20Cup">Dubonnet Cup</a> in 1910 at the <a href="Parc%20des%20Princes">Parc des Princes</a> Stadium in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. The result was a 2–1 victory for Swindon with <a href="Harold%20John%20Fleming">Harold Fleming</a> scoring both of the club's goals.
The following season, <a href="1910%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football">1910–11</a>, Swindon Town won the Southern League championship, earning them a <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">Charity Shield</a> match with the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> champions <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. This, the highest-scoring Charity Shield game to date, was played on 25 September 1911 at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a> with Manchester United winning 8–4. Some of the proceeds of this game were later donated to the survivors of the <a href="RMS%20Titanic">"Titanic"</a>. In 1912 Swindon Town reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup for a second time in 3 years, losing to Barnsley after a replay 1–0.
Swindon's exploits at this time owed a lot to the skilful forward <a href="Harold%20Fleming%20%28footballer%29">H.J. Fleming</a> who was capped by <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> 11 times between 1909 and 1914 despite playing outside the Football League. Fleming remained with Swindon throughout a playing career spanning 1907 and 1924 and went on to live in the town for his entire life.
Swindon entered <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> in 1920 as a founding member of <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three</a> and defeated <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> 9–1 in their first game of the season. This result stands as a record for the club in League matches.
After the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the War Department took over the <a href="County%20Ground%20%28Swindon%29">County Ground</a> in 1940, where for a while POWs (<a href="Prisoners%20of%20War">Prisoners of War</a>) were housed in huts placed on the pitch; for this the club received compensation of £4,570 in 1945. World War II affected Swindon Town more than most other football clubs and the club was almost disbanded; the club needed a large amount of time to recover and for this reason it failed to make any real impression in the league and would not climb into the second division until 1963 when they finished runners up to <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a>. The club was relegated back into Division Three in 1965, but it was about to create a sensation.
1969–2000.
In 1969, Swindon beat <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> <a href="1969%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">3–1</a> to win the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> for the only time in the club's history. As winners of the League Cup, Swindon were assured of a place in their first European competition: the <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>. However, <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> had previously agreed to inclusion criteria with the organizers which mandated that only League Cup winners from <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> would be able to take part. As the team were not eligible, the short-lived Anglo-Italian competitions were created to give teams from lower divisions experience in Europe. The first of these, the <a href="1969%20Anglo-Italian%20League%20Cup">1969 Anglo-Italian League Cup</a>, was contested over two legs against <a href="Coppa%20Italia">Coppa Italia</a> winners <a href="A.S.%20Roma">A.S. Roma</a>. Swindon won 5–2, with the scorer of two goals in the League Cup final – <a href="Don%20Rogers%20%28footballer%29">Don Rogers</a> – scoring once and new acquisition <a href="Arthur%20Horsfield">Arthur Horsfield</a> acquiring his first <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> for the club. The team then went on to win the <a href="1970%20Anglo-Italian%20Cup">1970 Anglo-Italian Cup</a> competition in a tournament beset by <a href="Football%20%28soccer%29%20hooliganism">hooliganism</a>. The final against <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">S.S.C. Napoli</a> was abandoned after 79 minutes following pitch invasions and a missile barrage, with <a href="teargas">teargas</a> being employed to allow the teams to return to the dressing room.
Following management changes, Swindon had a long unsuccessful period culminating in them being relegated in 1982 to the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>, the lowest professional Football League at the time. They were eventually promoted as champions in 1986 with the club achieving a Football League record of 102 points, the second club to score over 100 points in a season, <a href="York%20City%20F.C.">York City</a> having totalled 101 two years earlier. A year later they won the Third Division play-offs to achieve a second successive promotion. Promotion campaign Manager <a href="Lou%20Macari">Lou Macari</a> left in 1989 to take charge of <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> with veteran midfielder, and former <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentine international</a>, <a href="Osvaldo%20Ardiles">Ossie Ardiles</a> replacing him. In his first season, Swindon were <a href="1990%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20Final">Second Division play-off</a> winners, but the club later admitted 36 charges of breaching league rules, 35 due to illegal payments made to players, and were relegated to the Third Division — giving <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> promotion to the First Division and <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere Rovers</a> to the Second Division. The scandal saw then-chairman <a href="Brian%20Hillier">Brian Hillier</a> being given a six-month prison sentence and chief accountant Vince Farrar being put on probation. A later appeal saw Swindon Town being allowed to stay in the Second Division.
Ardiles remained in charge until March 1991, when he departed for <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> and was succeeded by new player-manager <a href="Glenn%20Hoddle">Glenn Hoddle</a>. Swindon progressed well during the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">1991–92 season</a>, Hoddle's first full season as manager, and just missed out on the Second Division play-offs, having briefly led the table in the autumn. A year later they beat Leicester City 4–3 in the new <a href="Football%20League%20Championship%20play-offs%231993">Division One play-off</a> final to achieve promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> — bringing top-division football to the club for the first time.
Hoddle moved to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> before the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20FA%20Premier%20League">1993–94 FA Premier League</a> season began, and was replaced by assistant <a href="John%20Gorman%20%28footballer%29">John Gorman</a>, but Swindon never adjusted to the pace of Premier League football. They were relegated after recording only five wins and conceding 100 goals — the latter record yet to be broken — and have never returned to the top flight. One of the few successes of the season was a 2–2 draw against champions Manchester United in the league.
The <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">following year</a>, Swindon were relegated for the second consecutive time and slipped into Division Two. Gorman had been sacked as manager in November 1994, and although his successor, player-manager <a href="Steve%20McMahon%20%28footballer%29">Steve McMahon</a>, was unable to avoid relegation, he did take Swindon to the semi-finals of the League Cup. McMahon then succeeded in getting Swindon back into Division One on his first attempt, winning the Division Two championship in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">1995–96</a>. McMahon remained as manager until September 1998, when he left by mutual consent after Swindon lost five of their nine opening games of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1998–99 season</a>.
2000–2020.
The club then went through five managers in five years (<a href="Andy%20King%20%28footballer%20born%201956%29">Andy King</a> was appointed twice), during which time they were again relegated into Division Two. The highlight of the next few seasons was a fifth-place finish in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division">2003–04</a> as financial troubles persisted. A first-round <a href="Football%20League%20One%20play-offs%232004">playoff</a> loss to <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a> on penalties meant Swindon extended their stay in the third tier, now renamed <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a>.
The club has been beset by financial difficulties throughout its recent history, having been placed into administration twice and also twice fought off winding-up orders from <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Customs%20and%20Excise">Her Majesty's Customs and Excise</a> over unpaid tax. The board was paying £100,000 to creditors annually (2% of the annual turnover), and only managed to begin the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Football%20League%20Two">2006–07 season</a> after sourcing £500,000 to pay for players' wages.
In 2006, caretaker manager (and former player) <a href="Iffy%20Onuora">Iffy Onuora</a> was unable to save Swindon from relegation to <a href="Football%20League%20Two">League Two</a> meaning they became the first ever former <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> team to be relegated to the lowest <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> division.
<a href="Dennis%20Wise">Dennis Wise</a> agreed to become the new Swindon manager in May 2006 following the relegation, with <a href="Gustavo%20Poyet">Gustavo Poyet</a> joining the coaching staff. After a good start to the season, the pair moved to <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a> in October. Veteran defender <a href="Ady%20Williams">Ady Williams</a> and <a href="Barry%20Hunter%20%28footballer%29">Barry Hunter</a> took temporary charge until <a href="Paul%20Sturrock">Paul Sturrock</a> was appointed on 7 November. Sturrock guided Swindon to promotion back to <a href="Football%20League%20One">Football League One</a> in his first season with the club, earning the third automatic promotion place in a 1–1 draw with <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> in the last game of the 2006–07 season.
In 2008, Swindon Town was taken over by a consortium, fronted by local businessman <a href="Andrew%20Fitton">Andrew Fitton</a>, with plans to clear all club debts by the end of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Football%20League%20Two">2007–08 season</a>.
Paul Sturrock having departed for <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a>, the consortium appointed Sturrock-recommended <a href="Maurice%20Malpas">Maurice Malpas</a> manager, and Swindon finished their first season back in League One in 13th, helped by 15-goal signing <a href="Simon%20Cox%20%28footballer%20born%201987%29">Simon Cox</a>. However, the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20One">2008–09 campaign</a> started badly and Malpas was sacked on 14 November 2008, with <a href="David%20Byrne%20%28footballer%20born%201961%29">David Byrne</a> taking over temporarily. <a href="Danny%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201960%29">Danny Wilson</a> was unveiled as the new manager on 26 December 2008. Wilson helped maintain Swindon's League One status and finished in 15th position, though only four points from the relegation zone, in his first season in charge.
The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League%20One">2009–10 season</a> would prove a vast improvement, despite the sale of League One top-scorer Simon Cox. The club maintained a play-off position going into the new year, and were at one point in second place with automatic promotion in their own hands. However, a slight slip in form towards the end of the season saw Swindon finish fifth, entering the play-offs against <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>. Swindon won the tie on penalties and went on to play in the <a href="Football%20League%20One%20play-offs">Football League One play-offs</a> final against <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> for a place in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Football League Championship</a>. However, they lost 1–0 in what was their first defeat in four appearances at Wembley.
After losing the final Swindon lost their top scorer <a href="Billy%20Paynter">Billy Paynter</a> who joined Leeds United on a free transfer, and sold club captain <a href="Gordon%20Greer">Gordon Greer</a>. Still, many bookmakers had Swindon as one of the favourites for promotion to the Championship going into the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Football%20League%20One">2010–11 season</a>. Inconsistent form left Swindon in mid-table for much of the season; however, a 4–2 win at <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> in January left fans hoping for a late-season surge. Instead, top-scorer <a href="Charlie%20Austin">Charlie Austin</a> was sold to <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> and the team did not win again for 19 matches. When Danny Wilson resigned on 2 March, <a href="Paul%20Hart">Paul Hart</a> was brought in but failed to save the Robins, and on 25 April 2011 Swindon were relegated to League Two yet again after losing 3–1 to <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>. Paul Hart was replaced for the last two games of the season by former player and current reserve and youth team coach <a href="Paul%20Bodin">Paul Bodin</a>.
Soon after the season ended, the board revealed that high-profile former player <a href="Paolo%20Di%20Canio">Paolo Di Canio</a> would take his first management position at the club. After losing seven of his first 13 games in charge, Swindon went on a 15-match unbeaten run which put them into promotion contention by the midpoint of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Football%20League%20Two">2011–12 season</a>. After a defeat on Boxing Day 2011 to <a href="Torquay%20United%20F.C.">Torquay United</a>, Swindon broke a club record by winning 10 consecutive league games, and by March they were well clear of the chasing pack at the top of League Two. They also enjoyed success in both the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, beating Premiership side <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> in the third round before losing to Championship side <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> in the fourth round, and the Football League Trophy, reaching the <a href="2012%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">final</a> at Wembley, where they were runners-up to League One side <a href="Chesterfield%20F.C.">Chesterfield</a>. On 28 April 2012, Swindon, already promoted, guaranteed their championship of League Two on 28 April after a 5–0 drubbing of <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a> at the County Ground.
On 18 February 2013, with Swindon riding high in League One and in contention for a second consecutive promotion, Di Canio announced his resignation, alleging mistreatment by the board of directors, including the sale of Matt Ritchie behind his back, and the financial instability of the club at the time. In his place came <a href="Kevin%20MacDonald%20%28footballer%29">Kevin MacDonald</a> who had previously held caretaker roles at <a href="Leicester%20City">Leicester City</a> and Aston Villa. MacDonald guided Swindon to the League One play-offs; however, they were knocked out after a penalty shoot-out defeat to <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>. On 13 July 2013, MacDonald left Swindon Town by mutual consent, only three weeks before the start of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Swindon%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a> season and only five months after taking the Swindon job.
In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Swindon%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2014–15</a> season, Swindon reached the League One Play-off final again where they lost 4–0 to <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston</a> after a season in which they were competing for automatic promotion. They went top of the league after a 3–0 win away to <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry</a>; however, a 2–0 defeat to <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> was the first of a series of results that saw Swindon's form dip, and a 1–0 defeat to bottom club <a href="Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.">Yeovil Town</a> meant that Swindon were consigned to finish in the play-offs. They reached <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a> after a record-breaking 5–5 draw (winning 7–6 on aggregate) against Sheffield United, the highest-scoring EFL play-off match in history.
In the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Swindon%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a> season, Swindon were relegated to League Two for a third time; they finished third from bottom on 22 April 2017 after losing 2–1 to <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a> with only one more fixture on the road in hand. Following this relegation, manager <a href="Luke%20Williams%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29">Luke Williams</a> was sacked after Swindon lost 3–0 at <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>.
2020–present.
On 9 June 2020, Swindon were crowned League Two champions on the basis of average points per game, matches in the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Swindon%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2019–20</a> season having been suspended from March due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom</a>. However, in the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Swindon%20Town%20F.C.%20season">following season</a>, the pandemic created financial difficulties for the club, with the chairman, <a href="Lee%20Power">Lee Power</a>, warning in February 2021 of potential bankruptcy, and then, in April 2021, being charged with breaching FA regulations concerning the club's ownership and/or funding. On 18 April, manager <a href="John%20Sheridan%20%28footballer%29">John Sheridan</a> resigned after winning just eight of 33 matches, with the club seven points from safety with four matches to play. The club's relegation to League Two was confirmed following a 5–0 defeat by <a href="Milton%20Keynes%20Dons%20F.C.">Milton Keynes Dons</a> on 24 April 2021.
On 26 May 2021, <a href="John%20McGreal">John McGreal</a> was appointed Swindon manager but, on 25 June 2021, after less than a month in the job, he left Swindon by mutual consent, citing ownership uncertainty which was preventing him signing new players. Chief executive Steve Anderson also left the club on the same day, followed by director of football <a href="Paul%20Jewell">Paul Jewell</a>. Swindon supporter groups urged fans to boycott games until the ownership problems were resolved, with High Court hearings due to start on 6 September 2021. On 30 June 2021, the Official Supporters Club was told that a deal to transfer ownership to Australian businessman Clem Morfuni's Axis group would be completed "in the next couple of weeks", though the club later complained that the Axis group was delaying payment.
In early July 2021, it emerged that players and staff had not received their June wages, and that the County Ground's owner, <a href="Swindon%20Borough%20Council">Swindon Borough Council</a>, was taking legal action after receiving no rent since April 2020. The EFL described the ownership wrangle as "concerning" and imposed a transfer embargo on the club. In pre-season friendlies at <a href="Melksham%20Town%20F.C.">Melksham Town</a> and <a href="Hungerford%20Town%20F.C.">Hungerford Town</a>, Swindon fielded sides featuring just a few experienced first-team players, with the rest of the squads being composed of youngsters and trialists. The club then cancelled its planned pre-season friendly with <a href="Swansea%20City%20F.C.">Swansea City</a> at the County Ground on 17 July 2021, citing "ongoing logistical and operational issues". On 15 July 2021, it was reported that the club had paid 60% of the outstanding wages due in June. On 21 July 2021, it was reported that Power had transferred ownership of his shares in the club, and that the EFL had granted Morfuni consent to acquire additional shares, having passed its owners' and directors' test. Morfuni appointed <a href="Ben%20Garner">Ben Garner</a> as head coach and <a href="Ben%20Chorley">Ben Chorley</a> as director of football plus Rob Angus (a former <a href="Nationwide%20Building%20Society">Nationwide</a> director) appointed as CEO and, on 26 July 2021, the new management announced their first signing, with midfielder <a href="Ben%20Gladwin">Ben Gladwin</a> returning for a fourth spell at Swindon. On 16 September 2021, Swindon Town was given a suspended three-point deduction by the EFL, relating to the non-payment of player wages in June.
Garner led Swindon to a sixth place finish in the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Swindon%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2021–22 season</a> with the club beaten on penalties by <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a> in the play-off semi-finals. The manager then left Swindon to join <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> in June 2022, being replaced by his former assistant <a href="Scott%20Lindsey">Scott Lindsey</a>, who spent half a season in the role before moving to <a href="Crawley%20Town%20F.C.">Crawley Town</a>. On 31 January 2023, <a href="Jody%20Morris">Jody Morris</a> was appointed manager; he was sacked on 1 May 2023 after just four wins from 18 games. The side finished the season in 10th place.
On 8 May 2023, <a href="Michael%20Flynn%20%28footballer%29">Michael Flynn</a> was appointed team manager on a two-year contract, officially taking charge following the last match of the season that same day. Rob Angus stood down as CEO in September 2023. In January 2024, a 2–1 defeat at <a href="Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.">Crewe</a> meant Swindon had lost ten of their last 15 matches, 
and Flynn was sacked as manager after just over eight months in charge.
Kit and badge.
Crest.
Swindon Town have used at least five different kit badges since their inception. The original badge depicted a robin inside a shield with the letters STFC in the four corners, this changed to the "steam train" badge which was a coat of arms for the club based heavily on the coat of arms used by the local council. The "steam train" badge was in the form of a traditional shield, bisected with the club's name, a GWR steam locomotive (as Swindon is a <a href="railway%20town">railway town</a>), a football and with a <a href="European%20robin">robin</a> sitting on top. Beneath the shield was a motto on a scroll – "Salubritas et Industria" – meaning "health and industry". This motto is also that of the town of <a href="Swindon">Swindon</a> itself.
During the 1970s the club changed the badge to one referred to as the "ST arrow" or "traffic sign" badge. This was circular and had the letters "S" and "T" interlocked, which both ends of the letter "S" being made into an arrow. Also shown was a simple football and the club name.
Following the 1985–86 season, the "steam train" badge was re-introduced onto the kits. The crest was re-styled and the text "Division Four Champions 1985/1986" replaced the motto.
A diamond shaped crest for Swindon Town was introduced at the beginning of the 1991–92 season following a series of financial problems for the club. The idea behind the new crest was to give the club a new fresh image.
"The 'travelling' football represents the club that is looking to the future with successful progress. The diamond shape clearly has the letter "S" (for Swindon) running through it, while a green section was also introduced to match a new 'green trim' on the team's home (red and white) shirts."
On 5 April 2007, the club unveiled plans to change the badge, claiming the diamond badge was correct for the time, but did not represent or show any of the club's heritage or history. Swindon offered fans the chance to vote on-line for the three new choices, which were all similar to the original steam train design, and a fourth option of keeping the 1991 design.
On 23 April 2007, it was announced that option three of the logo vote was the winner of the poll (it can be seen on the far right of the picture). Winning the vote with 68% in favour, the new badge includes the club name, a robin, a GWR steam locomotive – the rail industry being an important part of the Town's heritage – a football, and re-introduces the town's motto – 'Salubritas et Industria'. It has been in use since the beginning of the 2007–08 season.
Home kit.
Originally playing in black and white with the addition of blue <a href="sash">sash</a> for away games, the club changed to black and red quarters on entry to the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> in 1894. The club changed again in 1897 with the "<a href="Swindon%20Advertiser">Swindon Advertiser</a>" reporting:
"The new colours of the Swindon Town F.C. are to be green shirts, with white sleeves. Good-bye to the old well known red and black."
With problems obtaining green dyes, the kit was short-lived and Swindon Town changed their shirts to the more familiar red in 1901. Initially a dark maroon, a lighter shade was chosen for the start of the 1902–03 season and also resulted in the club's nickname "the Robins" appearing in print for the first time in programme notes for the first game. The nickname is a reference to the former name of the <a href="European%20robin">European robin</a> – "redbreast".
Swindon Town have played their home games in variations on the red and white theme since then, wearing a red shirt with white collars and white or red shorts for much of their history which has led to the team being known as the "Red and White Army". For example; the kit worn during the 1985–86 Division Four Champions season consisted of a red shirt with white pinstripes, white shorts and red socks and chants of "<a href="Lou%20Macari">Lou Macari</a>'s Red and White Army" were heard from the supporters at the final stages of the season.
Following the rebranding of the club in 1991, green elements were re-introduced onto the home strip and badge to represent the team's short-lived kit from the turn of the century. These were removed in 2007.
Away kit.
The club's <a href="away%20kit">away kit</a>s have only begun to change since the 1990s and the advent of the lucrative replica kit market. Swindon's first away kit (that was entirely separate to the home kit) consisted of an all-blue strip; this was not used for the club's <a href="Football%20League%20Cup%20Final%201969">1969 League Cup Final</a> victory where they elected to wear an all-white strip.
For a period in the 1980s the club changed their away kit to white shirts and black shorts and introduced a new third kit of yellow shirts and blue shorts. The club alternated between these two schemes as its away kit for the 1980s.
When the club re-branded in the 1991 close season, it introduced a new away strip: the white and green "potato print" shirt with dark blue shorts. This remained in use until its replacement in 1993 with another yellow and blue strip, integrating the new colour scheme by adding a green collar.
A special third kit was added for the 1996–97 season and was coloured "petrol green" in honour of sponsors <a href="Castrol">Castrol</a>.
Swindon wore black and gold striped away shirts for the 2003–04 season with an all-white third kit, following this with variants on the blue theme until returning to all-white in 2007.
In 2008–09 they returned to the dark blue away kit that was used previously for the 2006–07 season but this time they had white shorts instead of a whole dark blue strip. In 2009–10 they returned once again to the all-white kit, but unlike the home kit, which showed "<a href="FourFourTwo">FourFourTwo</a>" on the front, this showed "<a href="FIFA%2010">FIFA10</a>" on the front as a part of sponsorship with <a href="Electronic%20Arts">EA</a>. They also this year had an all-blue third kit which was featured for the FA Cup and also the play-off away game to Charlton.
In 2010–11 they had an all-black third kit. The all-black kit became the club's away kit for the 2011–12 season with an all-white kit as a third kit used for the FA Cup run. This kit caused controversy among some fans, because it had the sponsors "<a href="The%20People%20%28newspaper%29">The People</a>" printed on the shirts.
For 2012–13 they had a blue and yellow away kit, again controversial as these are the colours of Swindon's close rivals <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a>.
For the 2021–22 season, they released a checkered gold and green kit. The colours of the <a href="Australia%20national%20soccer%20team">Australia</a> national team, paying homage to the new Australian owner Clem Morfuni. Later in the season they also released a special all black third kit. This included a darkened club badge, intended to signify the club coming "out of the darkness" following the take over of the new owner.
Shirt sponsors.
Since 2015 Swindon's kit has been manufactured by <a href="Puma%20AG">Puma</a>. Previous manufacturers include Umbro, Admiral, Adidas, Coffer Sports, Spall, Diamond Leisure, Loki, Mizuno, Lotto, Xara, DGI, Strikeforce, and Lonsdale. The club's shirt sponsors have included ISIS, Lowndes Lambert Group, GWR FM, Burmah, Castrol, Nationwide, Kingswood Group, FourFourTwo, Samsung, EA Sports FIFA, C&D, Imagine Cruising, Bartercard, First City Nursing & Care and MiPermit.
Stadium.
Swindon Town's original pitch was located south of Bath Road, in the region of Bradford Road, adjacent to the <a href="Okus%20Quarry">Okus Quarry</a>. After a young spectator fell into the quarry the team decided to move first to Lansdown Road and then to a pitch near The Croft where they were to remain for the next 11 years.
Swindon Town have been playing at the <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Swindon">County Ground</a> since 1896. They played their games on the site of the adjacent cricket pitch also called the County Ground from 1893 until the ground opened.
Thomas Arkell of <a href="Arkell%27s%20Brewery">Arkell's Brewery</a> donated £300 to finance the construction of a stand on what was then known as the 'Wiltshire County Ground', this investment was enough to begin development of a purpose-built football ground. Since its original construction, the ground has been periodically updated with new features or fittings. A cover on the Shrivenham Road side was erected in 1932, followed by the current roof at the Town End. This cost £4,300, which was raised by the Supporters' Club, and was opened on 27 August 1938 by local <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">MP</a>, <a href="Wavell%20Wakefield%2C%201st%20Baron%20Wakefield%20of%20Kendal">W.W. Wakefield</a>.
The War Department took over the ground in 1940, where for a while <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">POW</a>s were housed in huts placed on the pitch. For this the club received compensation of £4,570 in 1945.
The addition of <a href="floodlights%20%28sport%29">floodlights</a> in 1951 at a cost of £350, gave Swindon the honour of being the first League club to do so. These were first tried out "v." Bristol City on 2 April 1951 beating <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> by six months.
These original set of lights were supplemented by lights on both side stand roofs, which were sufficient for the <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Swindon">County Ground</a> to stage its first floodlit league match on 29 February 1956 "v." <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>. (seven days after <a href="Fratton%20Park">Fratton Park</a> became the first ground to stage a floodlit league fixture). The present pylons date from 1960.
The ground currently contains elements constructed between 1950 and 1995, with the latest addition being the large sponsored stand on the south side. The County Ground is also the only football stadium in the world with a <a href="Rolex">Rolex</a> watch acting as its timekeeper, the clock on the Stratton Bank stand featuring its name was erected to celebrate promotion in 1963.
The ground itself was on land owned by <a href="Borough%20of%20Swindon">Swindon Borough Council</a> to which the club pays rent. Swindon had in the past considered a move to a club owned stadium to generate more revenue, but did not have the financial backing to do so. In 2006 a redevelopment campaign for the County Ground began, with the club and TrustSTFC (the <a href="supporters%27%20trust">supporters' trust</a>) raising a petition to 'Save Our Home' urging the Borough Council to "facilitate the redevelopment of the stadium and do everything they can to keep the club within the Borough" including the proposed upgrading of the adjacent Cricket Club to County standard and Athletic Club to Olympic standard.
On 24 March 2023, Swindon Town bought the County Ground for £2.3 million, as part of a joint venture with TrustSTFC, giving fans the opportunity to own a percentage of the Ground.
Supporters.
As an expanding railway town, the club had attendances of up to 32,000 on match days until the early 1970s. Due to Swindon's low unemployment rate (one of the lowest in the United Kingdom), more people work in the town than live there and so are unlikely to support the team. In addition; poor team performances, the financial instability in the club and the change to an all-seated stadium following the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> have led to attendances at the County Ground dropping.
With an all-seated capacity of 15,728 at the County Ground, Swindon averaged a home attendance of 5,839 for the 2004–05 season. Only 37% of the grounds seats were occupied at a game on average.
This rose to 5,950 (37.8%) in 2005–06 and was reported as 7,109 (45.2%) for the 2006–07 season.
A core group of fans has inhabited the Town End of the stadium since the 1980s, producing past fanzines such as "The 69'er", "Bring the Noise", "Randy Robin" and "The Magic Roundabout" amongst others. Supporters call the team The Town, The Reds, STFC and also the Red and White Army, the latter being a term the supporters use to identify themselves as well. The Junior Robins is the children's supporters club which operates to provide lower ticket prices, away game activities and transport to young fans. Membership of the club also allows them to be nominated as game mascot and gives them the opportunity to train in one of the many Football Schools run by the club.
The <a href="supporters%27%20trust">supporters' trust</a>, TrustSTFC, was established in 2000. This organisation is a democratically elected group of fans who raise funds for the club and aim to give supporters access and input into decisions made by the club's board. The group run a number of schemes including the Loan Note Scheme, the aim of which is to buy shares in the club and assist with investment. Another scheme is the Red Army Fund; the money raised by this fund is given to the club to contribute towards the purchase and wages of new players. TrustSTFC also take part in the Fans' Consortium, which aims to place a supporter with a large stake-holding in the club onto the board of directors. The trust is also currently campaigning with the club for the re-development of the County Ground.
The "Football Fever Report" published by statisticians of the <a href="Littlewoods%20Pools">Littlewoods Football Pools</a> was released in January 2007. It researched those teams that were the most stressful to support. Swindon Town was placed fifth out of all 92 League clubs, with the report stating –
"It's only just over a decade ago that Swindon were a Premier League side, but the past 10 years have been tough going for fans at the County Ground. Relegation from the top flight in 1994 was followed by a second successive drop, and although promotion from Division Two was secured a year later, the team struggled in Division One in the next three seasons, finishing 19th, 18th and 17th. In 2000 came relegation, and a year later Swindon avoided another 'double relegation' by just one point. A glimmer of hope came when the play-offs were reached in 2004 – ending in a semi-final loss to Brighton – but last term Town became the first club to drop into the bottom tier of the Football League having once been in the Premier League. We bet Robins' fans can hardly believe it."
With the dwindling support during matches in the 2004–05 season, another fans' group, Red Army Loud and Proud was formed. It is a small group of fans attempting to bring back the atmosphere and fun to match days. With the stated aim of being "the 12th man on the pitch", the group sponsors players and also provides large colourful flags to the matches.
However, in more recent years 2010–11 Swindon has rapidly increasing attendances with an 8,400 average attendance for the 2010–11 season despite relegation.
Hooliganism.
Swindon Town has had problems with <a href="Football%20hooliganism">hooliganism</a> since the 1970s, with the first known group being called the Swindon Town Aggro Boys (STAB). In a home game against <a href="Wrexham%20F.C.">Wrexham</a> in March 1978, STAB were responsible for pelting the opposing goalkeeper with darts, stones and a golf ball. Club chairman Cecil Green later proclaimed: "We intend to stamp out this thuggery. The incidents were diabolical." A new hooligan gang emerged in the 1980s, the Swindon Southside Firm (SSF), who were named after the area of terracing they occupied. In a match at <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a>, then manager <a href="Lou%20Macari">Lou Macari</a> walked straight into a group of more than 100 SSF members chasing Northampton fans up the street. Macari said the incident was "worse than a <a href="Old%20Firm">Celtic–Rangers game</a>".
In the 1990s, the Swindon Active Service (SAS) came to prominence and it is believed they were at the centre of several hostilities with fans of local rivals Oxford and Reading. In September 1998, 19 SAS members were arrested at the home match with Oxford. A fracas at an away game versus <a href="AFC%20Bournemouth">AFC Bournemouth</a> on 18 December 2004 resulted in the arrest of seventeen and the imposition of banning orders on those found to be guilty. The fighting, involving more than forty supporters, occurred in a busy shopping centre before the game. "District Judge Roger House said it had been a 'frightening and terrifying' experience for scores of Christmas shoppers who witnessed the scenes."
The "<a href="Swindon%20Advertiser">Swindon Advertiser</a>" reported that "The area was packed with Christmas shoppers, who watched in horror as pub windows were smashed and fans traded insults."
On 16 December 2006, Swindon recorded one of their highest attendances of the season: 10,010 at a home win against rivals <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>. The game was marred by supporter trouble which resulted in 11 arrests and saw an area of seating in the Arkell's Stand damaged, with the "<a href="Western%20Daily%20Press">Western Daily Press</a>" reporting that "the incident [...] ended with damage to 60 seats after they were used as missiles between opposing fans". On the day of the return game in Bristol, 20 Rovers fans attacked a number of Swindon supporters with baseball bats at a local pub.
Nick Lowles, author of "Hooligans 2: The M–Z of Britain's Football Hooligan Gangs", has said "If you look at Swindon, the police have been very proactive in the last five years in terms of stopping hooliganism".
Swindon Town has imposed banning orders on those supporters who cause disruption, criminal damage or are violent when attending games. There were 29 banning orders in place in 2006, which was an increase from a total of 11 in 2005. The increase in banning orders has resulted in a reduction of arrests at games, with only 22 people being arrested attending games in 2005–06 compared to 39 arrests in 2004–05. Of the 22 arrests in 2005–06; 11 were for Public Disorder, five for <a href="violent%20disorder">violent disorder</a> and the rest were made up of offences relating to missile throwing, racist chanting, pitch invasion, alcohol-related offences and one incident of being in possession of an offensive weapon. 33 Swindon fans were also banned from travelling to the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>. In 2013, 10 Swindon fans were charged with violent disorder following an incident outside the Royal Oak pub in Brentford before the club's League 1 play-off semi-final defeat.
On 23 November 2013 a Swindon fan was arrested after running onto the pitch and punching <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a>'s goalkeeper, <a href="Jamie%20Jones%20%28footballer%29">Jamie Jones</a>.
On 10th October 2023, Swindon Town met local rivals <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> in an <a href="EFL%20Trophy">EFL Trophy</a> game for their first competitive fixture in over 21 years. After the game, fighting broke out between the 2 sets of fans, leading to 4 arrests by the <a href="Thames%20Valley%20Police">Thames Valley Police</a>.
Rivalries.
In 2003, a poll of supporters of all Football League clubs to find out which teams they see as their main rivals was conducted by the <a href="Football%20Fans%20Census">Football Fans Census</a>, the results of which put Swindon in joint 13th place on the list of teams with most rivals. This was calculated from the number of other clubs that consider Swindon to be their first, second or third biggest rivals. Swindon fans considered <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a> to be their main rivals, something that was reciprocated by Oxford fans. Less fierce rivalries exist with <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>, <a href="Cheltenham%20Town%20F.C.">Cheltenham Town</a>, <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>, <a href="Forest%20Green%20Rovers%20F.C.">Forest Green Rovers</a>, <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a> of Wales and even <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> of east England.
Swindon Town Women F.C..
Swindon Town Ladies FC were established on 28 September 1993, after breaking away from the established Swindon Spitfires Women's and Girls' Football Club, while they rebranded to Swindon Town Women in July 2019. The current Swindon Town Women Football Club (STWFC) first team play in the <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20National%20League">FA Women's National League</a> South West Division 1. Swindon Town Women currently play their home games at Foundation Park and the County Ground. In April 2023 the club officially came under the main Club umbrella with their first actions to replace the management team of the First and Development sides, while folding their U18s.

English Football Hall of Fame.
"The following have either played for or managed Swindon Town and have been inducted into the <a href="English%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">English Football Hall of Fame</a>"
Statistics and records.
<a href="John%20Trollope%20%28footballer%29">John Trollope</a> holds the record for Swindon Town appearances, having played 889 first-team matches between 1960 and 1980. Trollope also holds the <a href="Football%20records%20in%20England">English Football League Record</a> of most appearances by a player at one club, having played in 770 League games. Central defender <a href="Maurice%20Owen">Maurice Owen</a> comes second, having played 601 times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by <a href="Sam%20Burton">Sam Burton</a>, who is third with 509 appearances.
<a href="Harry%20Morris%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201897%29">Harry Morris</a> holds all of Swindon's goal records, having scored 229 goals for the club between 1926 and 1933. <a href="Harold%20John%20Fleming">Harold Fleming</a> is second with 203, with <a href="Don%20Rogers%20%28footballer%29">Don Rogers</a> third with 178. Morris scored the most goals in a season with 48 during 1926–27, 47 of which were in League games which is another club record. The most goals scored by an individual is also held by Morris and Keith East, who have both scored 5 against League opposition (Morris having achieved this in 1926 and 1930).
The highest attendance at the County Ground of 32,000 was recorded on 15 January 1972 in a <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup third round</a> match against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. The capacity of the ground is now 15,728 so it is unlikely that this record will be broken in the foreseeable future.
Swindon Town have also set records in English football, being the second team (after York City in 1983–84) to score over 100 points in the League when they became <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> champions in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1985–86</a>. The total of 102 that the club scored has since been beaten. They also hold the <a href="Football%20records%20in%20England%23Team%202">Premier League record</a> for most goals conceded in a season, 100 in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94</a>, though several teams have finished with a lower points tally.
On 20 February 2007 the club played in a landmark League game away to <a href="Barnet%20F.C.">Barnet</a>, a 1–0 loss. The completion of this match meant that Swindon had, during their history, played a League game at home and away against every team who, in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07 season</a>, <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20in%20English%20football">2011–12 season</a> and <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">2019–20 season</a>, were in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a>, <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a> and <a href="Football%20League%20Two">League Two</a> but not the <a href="National%20League%20%28English%20football%29">National League</a>.

History.
Founding and early years.
In 1904, <a href="Gus%20Mears">Gus Mears</a> acquired the <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a> athletics stadium in <a href="Fulham">Fulham</a> with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham F.C.</a> was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Chelsea">Chelsea</a> was chosen for the new club; names like "Kensington FC", "Stamford Bridge FC" and "London FC" were also considered. Chelsea F.C. was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on <a href="Fulham%20Road">Fulham Road</a>, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.
Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in its early years. The team reached the <a href="1915%20FA%20Cup%20final">1915 FA Cup final</a>, where they lost to <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point. Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players and attracted large crowds. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons including <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">1907–08</a>, <a href="1909%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">1909–10</a>, <a href="1911%E2%80%9312%20in%20English%20football">1911–12</a>, <a href="1912%E2%80%9313%20in%20English%20football">1912–13</a>, <a href="1913%E2%80%9314%20in%20English%20football">1913–14</a> and <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20</a>. They were FA Cup semi-finalists in <a href="FA%20Cup%201919-20">1920</a> and <a href="FA%20Cup%201931-32">1932</a> and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years.
Modernisation and the first league championship.
Former <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> and England centre-forward <a href="Ted%20Drake">Ted Drake</a> was appointed manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's <a href="Chelsea%20pensioner">Chelsea pensioner</a> crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20Chelsea%20F.C.%20season">1954–55</a>. The following season saw UEFA create the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Champions' Cup</a>, but after objections from <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started. Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach <a href="Tommy%20Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a>.
Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up, and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> but faltering late on in the other two. In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, <a href="Dave%20Sexton">Dave Sexton</a>, Chelsea won the <a href="1970%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup in 1970</a>, beating <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> 2–1 in a final replay. The following year, Chelsea took their first European honour, a <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> triumph, with another replayed win, this time over <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> in Athens.
Redevelopment and financial crisis.
The late 1970s through to the '80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club, star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious <a href="hooliganism">hooligan</a> element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade. In 1982, at the nadir of their fortunes, Chelsea were acquired by <a href="Ken%20Bates">Ken Bates</a> from Mears' great-nephew <a href="Brian%20Mears">Brian Mears</a>, for the nominal sum of £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">AIM</a> stock exchange in March 1996 although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home. On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> for the first time, but in 1983 manager <a href="John%20Neal%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201932%29">John Neal</a> put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division with two top-six finishes, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.
After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash. In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman <a href="Matthew%20Harding">Matthew Harding</a> became a director and loaned the club £26 million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players. Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the <a href="1994%20FA%20Cup%20final">1994 FA Cup final</a>. The appointment of <a href="Ruud%20Gullit">Ruud Gullit</a> as player-manager in 1996 began an upturn in the team's fortunes. He added several top international players to the side and led the club to their first major honour since 1971, the <a href="1997%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup</a>. Gullit was replaced by <a href="Gianluca%20Vialli">Gianluca Vialli</a>, whose reign saw Chelsea win the <a href="1998%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">League Cup</a>, the <a href="1998%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20final">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> and the <a href="1998%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup in 1998</a>, and the <a href="2000%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup in 2000</a>. They also mounted a strong title challenge in 1998–99, finishing four points behind champions Manchester United, and made their first appearance in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>. Vialli was sacked in favour of <a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a>, who guided Chelsea to the <a href="2002%20FA%20Cup%20final">2002 FA Cup final</a> and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.
2003–2022: Abramovich era.
With the club facing an apparent financial crisis, Bates unexpectedly sold Chelsea F.C. in June 2003 for £60 million. In so doing, he reportedly recognised a personal profit of £17 million on the club he had bought for £1 in 1982 (his stake had been diluted to just below 30% over the years). The club's new owner was <a href="Russian%20oligarchs">Russian oligarch</a> and billionaire <a href="Roman%20Abramovich">Roman Abramovich</a>, who also took on responsibility for the club's £80 million of debt, quickly paying some of it. <a href="Sergei%20Pugachev">Sergei Pugachev</a> alleged Chelsea was bought on Putin's orders, an allegation Abramovich has denied. Bates mentioned that Abramovich was in talks to buy Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur before he bought Chelsea in a deal sealed in a day.
Over £100 million was spent on new players, but Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies, and was replaced by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a>. Under Mourinho, Chelsea became the fifth English team to win back-to-back league championships since the Second World War (<a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Premier%20League">2004–05</a> and <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20FA%20Premier%20League">2005–06</a>), in addition to winning an FA Cup (<a href="2007%20FA%20Cup%20final">2007</a>) and two League Cups (<a href="2005%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2005</a> and <a href="2007%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2007</a>). After a poor start to the 2007–08 season, Mourinho was replaced by <a href="Avram%20Grant">Avram Grant</a>, who led the club to their first <a href="2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">UEFA Champions League final</a>, which they lost on penalties to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. The club did not turn a profit in the first nine years of Abramovich's ownership, and made record losses of £140m in June 2005.
In 2009, under caretaker manager <a href="Guus%20Hiddink">Guus Hiddink</a>, Chelsea won another <a href="2009%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup</a>. In <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10</a>, his successor <a href="Carlo%20Ancelotti">Carlo Ancelotti</a> led them to their first <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> and <a href="2010%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup</a> <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">Double</a>, also becoming the first English top-flight club to score 100 league goals in a season since <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1963</a>. In 2012, <a href="Roberto%20Di%20Matteo">Roberto Di Matteo</a> led Chelsea to their seventh <a href="2012%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup</a>, and their first <a href="2012%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">UEFA Champions League title</a>, beating <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 4–3 on penalties, the first London club to win the trophy. The following year the club won the <a href="2013%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20final">UEFA Europa League</a>, making them the first club to hold two major European titles simultaneously and one of <a href="UEFA%20club%20competition%20records%23List%20of%20teams%20to%20have%20won%20the%20three%20main%20European%20club%20competitions">five clubs</a> to have won the three main UEFA trophies. Mourinho returned as manager in 2013 and led Chelsea to <a href="2015%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">League Cup</a> success in March 2015, and the Premier League title two months later. Mourinho was sacked after four months of the following season after a poor start.
In November 2012, Chelsea announced a profit of £1.4 million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first time the club had made a profit under Abramovich's ownership. This was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever profit of £18.4 million for the year to June 2014. In 2018 Chelsea announced a record after-tax profit of £62 million.
In 2017, under new coach <a href="Antonio%20Conte">Antonio Conte</a>, Chelsea won their sixth English title and the following season won their eighth FA Cup. In 2018 Conte was sacked after a fifth-place finish and replaced with <a href="Maurizio%20Sarri">Maurizio Sarri</a>, under whom Chelsea reached the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20EFL%20Cup">League Cup final</a>, which they lost on penalties to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> and won the <a href="2019%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20final">Europa League</a> for a second time, beating <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 4–1 in the final. Sarri then left the club to become manager of <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> and was replaced by former Chelsea player <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard</a>.
In Lampard's <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">first season</a> he guided Chelsea to fourth place in the Premier League and reached the FA Cup <a href="2020%20FA%20Cup%20final">final</a>, losing 2–1 to Arsenal. Lampard was dismissed in January 2021 and replaced with <a href="Thomas%20Tuchel">Thomas Tuchel</a>. 
Under Tuchel, Chelsea reached the <a href="2021%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a>, losing 1–0 to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>, and won their second UEFA Champions League title with a <a href="2021%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">1–0 win</a> over <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in Porto. The club subsequently won the <a href="2021%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2021 UEFA Super Cup</a> for the second time by defeating <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a> 6–5 in a penalty shootout, after it had ended 1–1 in Belfast after extra time, and the <a href="2021%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">2021 FIFA Club World Cup</a> (the first for the club) in <a href="Abu%20Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a> after beating Brazilian <a href="Sociedade%20Esportiva%20Palmeiras">Palmeiras</a> 2–1.
On 18 April 2021, Chelsea announced it would be joining a new <a href="European%20Super%20League">European Super League</a>, a league competition comprising the biggest European clubs. After a backlash from supporters, the club announced their withdrawal days later. The club opted against furloughing their non-matchday staff during the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, with the decision reportedly coming from Abramovich himself. Chelsea, one of the first clubs to help the <a href="National%20Health%20Service">National Health Service</a>, lent the club-owned Millennium Hotel for the NHS staff.
Amidst financial sanctions leveled at Russian oligarchs by Western governments in response to the <a href="2022%20Russian%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine">2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>, Abramovich stated on 26 February that he would hand over the <a href="stewardship">stewardship</a> of Chelsea to the trustees of the Chelsea Foundation. The trustees did not immediately agree, due to legal concerns regarding the rules of the <a href="Charity%20Commission%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Charity Commission for England and Wales</a>. A week later, Abramovich <a href="Debt%20relief">wrote-off</a> the £1.5 billion the club owed him, and put the club up for sale, pledging to donate net proceeds from it to the victims of the war in Ukraine.
On 10 March 2022, the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British government</a> announced sanctions on Abramovich with Chelsea allowed to operate under a special license until 31 May. In the following weeks, reports emerged of Abramovich's involvement in brokering a peace deal between <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and securing safe evacuation corridors in besieged Ukrainian cities. An American government official revealed that the Ukrainian president, <a href="Volodymyr%20Zelenskyy">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> had requested that the US government not levy sanctions against Abramovich given his importance to war relief efforts.
2022–present: BlueCo era.
On 7 May 2022, Chelsea confirmed that terms have been agreed for a new ownership group, led by <a href="Todd%20Boehly">Todd Boehly</a>, <a href="Clearlake%20Capital">Clearlake Capital</a>, <a href="Mark%20Walter">Mark Walter</a> and <a href="Hansj%C3%B6rg%20Wyss">Hansjörg Wyss</a>, to acquire the club. The group was later known as <a href="BlueCo">BlueCo</a>. The UK government approved the £4.25bn takeover, ending Abramovich's 19-year ownership of the club. Bruce Buck, who served as chairman since 2003, was replaced by Boehly, while long-serving club director and "de facto" sporting director <a href="Marina%20Granovskaia">Marina Granovskaia</a> left, as did <a href="Petr%20%C4%8Cech">Petr Čech</a> from the role of technical and performance advisor.
Chelsea won six of the first 11 games of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Chelsea%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a>, but only five of the remaining 27. The club scored a record-low 38 goals across the entire season and finished in the bottom half of the table for the first time since 1995–96.
Stadium.
Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. The stadium was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the next 28 years it was used by the <a href="London%20Athletic%20Club">London Athletic Club</a> as an arena for athletics meetings. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman <a href="Gus%20Mears">Gus Mears</a> and his brother <a href="Joseph%20Mears">Joseph</a>, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5 acre (51,000 m2) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a>, who had also designed <a href="Ibrox%20Stadium">Ibrox</a>, <a href="Craven%20Cottage">Craven Cottage</a> and <a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a>. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.
Starting with an open bowl-like design and one grandstand with seating, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000, making it the second biggest stadium in England after <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre">Crystal Palace</a>. The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around 20% of the stand. As the roof resembled that of a corrugated iron shed, the stand eventually became known as the "Shed End", although it is unknown who first coined this name. From the 1960s, it became known as the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters. In 1939, another small seated stand was added, the North Stand, which remained until its demolition in 1975.
In the early 1970s, the club's owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium. Work began in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and ultimately only the East Stand was completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy. The <a href="Fee%20simple">freehold</a> was sold to property developers and the club were under threat of eviction from the stadium. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at Stamford Bridge was secured and renovation work resumed. The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001. The East Stand was retained from the 1970s development. In 1996, the north stand was renamed the <a href="Matthew%20Harding">Matthew Harding</a> stand, after the club director and benefactor who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier that year.
When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the <a href="Ken%20Bates">Bates</a> era many additional features were added to the complex including two <a href="Millennium%20%26amp%3B%20Copthorne%20Hotels">Millennium & Copthorne hotels</a>, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the "Chelsea Village" brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of "Chelsea Village" or "The Village".
The Stamford Bridge <a href="Freehold%20%28law%29">freehold</a>, the <a href="Association%20football%20pitch">pitch</a>, the turnstiles and Chelsea's <a href="naming%20rights">naming rights</a> are now owned by <a href="Chelsea%20Pitch%20Owners">Chelsea Pitch Owners</a>, a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change their name.
Chelsea's <a href="Cobham%20Training%20Centre">training ground</a> is located in <a href="Cobham%2C%20Surrey">Cobham, Surrey</a>. Chelsea moved to Cobham in 2004. Their previous training ground in <a href="Harlington%2C%20London">Harlington</a> was taken over by <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">QPR</a> in 2005. The new training facilities in Cobham were completed in 2007.
Stamford Bridge hosted the <a href="FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> from 1920 to 1922, has held 10 <a href="FA%20Cup%20Semi-finals">FA Cup Semi-finals</a> (most recently in <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20FA%20Cup">1978</a>), ten <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Charity Shield</a> matches (the last in <a href="1970%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">1970</a>), and three <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England international</a> matches, the last in 1932; it was also the venue for an unofficial "Victory International" in 1946. The <a href="2013%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Champions%20League%20final">2013 UEFA Women's Champions League final</a> was played at Stamford Bridge as well. 
The stadium has also been used for a variety of other sports. In October 1905 it hosted a <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> match between the <a href="The%20Original%20All%20Blacks">All Blacks</a> and Middlesex, and in 1914 hosted a baseball match between the touring <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> and the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>. It was the venue for a <a href="boxing">boxing</a> match between world <a href="flyweight">flyweight</a> champion <a href="Jimmy%20Wilde">Jimmy Wilde</a> and Joe Conn in 1918. The running track was used for <a href="dirt%20track%20racing">dirt track racing</a> between 1928 and 1932, <a href="greyhound%20racing">greyhound racing</a> from 1933 to 1968, and <a href="Midget%20car%20racing">Midget car racing</a> in 1948. In 1980, Stamford Bridge hosted the first international <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">floodlit</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a> match in the UK, between <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a> and the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>. It was also the home stadium of the <a href="London%20Monarchs">London Monarchs</a> <a href="American%20Football">American Football</a> team for the <a href="1997%20London%20Monarchs%20season">1997 season</a>.
The previous owner Abramovich and the club's then executive board determined that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Arsenal</a> and <a href="Old%20Trafford">Manchester United</a>. Owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines, fans can only enter Stamford Bridge via the <a href="Fulham%20Road">Fulham Road</a>, which places constraints on expansion due to <a href="Occupational%20safety%20and%20health">health and safety</a> regulations. The club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep Chelsea at their current home, but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites, including the <a href="Earls%20Court%20Exhibition%20Centre">Earls Court Exhibition Centre</a>, <a href="Battersea%20Power%20Station">Battersea Power Station</a> and the <a href="Chelsea%20Barracks">Chelsea Barracks</a>. In October 2011, a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders. In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase <a href="Battersea%20Power%20Station">Battersea Power Station</a>, with a view to developing the site into a new stadium, but lost out to a Malaysian consortium. The club subsequently announced plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000-seater stadium,
and in January 2017 these plans were approved by Hammersmith and Fulham council. However, on 31 May 2018, the club released a statement saying that the new stadium project had been put on hold indefinitely, citing "the current unfavourable investment climate."
In July 2022, it was reported that the club's new owner <a href="Todd%20Boehly">Todd Boehly</a> had appointed American architect <a href="Janet%20Marie%20Smith">Janet Marie Smith</a> to oversee the renovation of the stadium.
Identity.
Crest.
Chelsea has had four main <a href="Crest%20%28sports%29">crests</a>, which all underwent minor variations. The first, adopted when the club was founded, was the image of a <a href="Chelsea%20Pensioner">Chelsea Pensioner</a>, the army veterans who reside at the nearby <a href="Royal%20Hospital%20Chelsea">Royal Hospital Chelsea</a>. This contributed to the club's original "pensioner" nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. When <a href="Ted%20Drake">Ted Drake</a> became Chelsea manager in 1952, he began to modernise the club. Believing the Chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned, he insisted that it be replaced. A stop-gap badge which comprised the initials C.F.C. was adopted for a year. In 1953, the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a <a href="crosier">staff</a>. It was based on elements in the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Chelsea">Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea</a> with the "lion rampant regardant" taken from the arms of then club president <a href="Charles%20Cadogan%2C%208th%20Earl%20Cadogan">Viscount Chelsea</a> and the staff from the <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Abbots of Westminster</a>, former Lords of the Manor of Chelsea. It also featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs. This was the first Chelsea crest to appear on the shirts, in the early 1960s. In 1975, a <a href="heraldic%20badge">heraldic badge</a> was granted by the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> for use by Chelsea. The badge took the form of the familiar lion and staff encircled by a blue ring but without lettering and without the red roses and red footballs (<a href="blazon">blazon</a>ed as "A lion rampant reguardant azure supporting with the forepaws a crozier or all within an annulet azure"). In 1986, with <a href="Ken%20Bates">Ken Bates</a> owner of the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked. The new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, in white and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. This lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications such as the use of different colours, including red from 1987 to 1995, and yellow from 1995 until 1999, before the white returned. With the new ownership of <a href="Roman%20Abramovich">Roman Abramovich</a>, and the club's centenary approaching, combined with demands from fans for the popular 1950s badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2005. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06</a> season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 Years' and 'Centenary 2005–2006' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.
Colours.
Chelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they originally used the paler <a href="eton%20blue">eton blue</a>, which was taken from the racing colours of then club president, <a href="Earl%20Cadogan">Earl Cadogan</a>, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks. The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager <a href="Tommy%20Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a> changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.
Chelsea's away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club have had a number of black or dark blue away kits which alternate every year. As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a>'s kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit inspired by the <a href="Golden%20Team">Hungarian national side</a> of the 1950s. Other away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986 to 1989, red and white diamonds from 1990 to 1992, graphite and tangerine from 1994 to 1996, and luminous yellow from 2007 to 2008. The graphite and tangerine strip has appeared in lists of the worst football kits ever.
Songs and fan chants.
The song "<a href="Blue%20Is%20the%20Colour%20%28song%29">Blue is the Colour</a>" was released as a single in the build-up to the <a href="1972%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1972 League Cup final</a>, with all members of Chelsea's first team squad singing; it reached number five in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>.

In 2000, Chelsea released the song "<a href="Blue%20Tomorrow">Blue Tomorrow</a>". It reached number 22 in the UK Singles Chart.
At matches, Chelsea fans sing <a href="football%20chants">chants</a> such as "<a href="Carefree%20%28chant%29">Carefree</a>" (to the tune of "<a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Dance%20%28hymn%29">Lord of the Dance</a>", whose lyrics were probably written by supporter Mick Greenaway), "Ten Men Went to Mow", "We All Follow the Chelsea" (to the tune of "<a href="Land%20of%20Hope%20and%20Glory">Land of Hope and Glory</a>"), "Zigga Zagga", and the celebratory "Celery". The latter is often accompanied by fans throwing celery at each other, although the vegetable was banned inside Stamford Bridge after an incident involving midfielder <a href="Cesc%20F%C3%A0bregas">Cesc Fàbregas</a> at the <a href="2007%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">2007 League Cup final</a>. Popular fan chants include, "Super Chelsea", "Super Frank" (dedicated to all-time leading goal scorer <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard</a>), "We love you Chelsea" and "Come on Chelsea". There also some situation specific or team specific chants meant to rile up opposition teams, managers or players.
Support.
Chelsea is among the most widely supported football clubs in the world. It has the sixth-highest average attendance in the history of <a href="Football%20in%20England">English football</a>, and regularly attract over 40,000 fans to Stamford Bridge; they were the seventh best-supported <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> team in the 2013–14 season, with an average gate of 41,572.<ref name="14/15 attendances"></ref> Chelsea's traditional fanbase comes from all over the <a href="Greater%20London">Greater London</a> area including working-class parts such as <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a> and <a href="Battersea">Battersea</a>, wealthier areas like Chelsea and <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a>, and from the <a href="home%20counties">home counties</a>. There are also numerous official supporters clubs in the United Kingdom and all over the world. Between 2007 and 2012, Chelsea were ranked fourth worldwide in annual replica kit sales, with an average of 910,000. As of 2023, Chelsea has 118.9 million followers on social media, the fourth highest among football clubs.
During the 1970s and 1980s in particular, Chelsea supporters were associated with <a href="Football%20%28soccer%29%20hooliganism">football hooliganism</a>. The club's "<a href="Football%20hooliganism">football firm</a>", originally known as the Chelsea Shed Boys, and subsequently as the <a href="Chelsea%20Headhunters">Chelsea Headhunters</a>, were nationally notorious for football violence, alongside hooligan firms from other clubs such as <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>'s <a href="Inter%20City%20Firm">Inter City Firm</a> and <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>'s <a href="Millwall%20Bushwackers">Bushwackers</a>, before, during and after matches. The increase of hooligan incidents in the 1980s led chairman Ken Bates to propose erecting an electric fence to deter them from invading the pitch, a proposal that the <a href="Greater%20London%20Council">Greater London Council</a> rejected.
Since the 1990s, there has been a marked decline in crowd trouble at matches, as a result of stricter policing, <a href="Closed-circuit%20television">CCTV</a> in grounds and the advent of <a href="All-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadia</a>. In 2007, the club launched the <a href="Back%20to%20the%20Shed%20campaign">Back to the Shed campaign</a> to improve the atmosphere at home matches, with notable success. According to <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> statistics, 126 Chelsea fans were arrested for football-related offences during the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10</a> season, the third highest in the division, and 27 <a href="banning%20order">banning order</a>s were issued, the fifth-highest in the division.
Rivalries.
Chelsea have long-standing rivalries with North London clubs <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> and <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. A <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.%E2%80%93Leeds%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">strong rivalry</a> with <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a> dates back to several heated and controversial matches in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the <a href="1970%20FA%20Cup%20final">1970 FA Cup final</a>. More recently a <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.%E2%80%93Liverpool%20F.C.%20rivalry">rivalry</a> with <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> has grown following repeated clashes in cup competitions. Fellow <a href="West%20London%20derby">West London</a> clubs <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>, <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> and <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> are also considered rivals, but less so in recent times as matches have only taken place intermittently due to the teams often being in separate divisions.
A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com found that Chelsea fans consider their main rivalries to be with (in descending order): <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, Tottenham Hotspur and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. In the same survey, fans of Arsenal, Fulham, Leeds United, QPR, Tottenham, and West Ham United named Chelsea as one of their three main rivals. In a 2008 poll conducted by the <a href="Football%20Fans%20Census">Football Fans Census</a>, Chelsea fans named Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United as their most disliked clubs. In the same survey, "Chelsea" was the top answer to the question "Which other English club do you dislike the most?" A 2012 survey, conducted among 1,200 supporters of the top four league divisions across the country, found that many clubs' main rivals had changed since 2003 and reported that Chelsea fans consider Tottenham to be their main rivals, above Arsenal and Manchester United. Additionally, fans of Arsenal, Brentford, Fulham, Liverpool, Manchester United, QPR, Tottenham and West Ham identified Chelsea as one of their top three rivals.

Greaves holds the club record for the most goals scored in one season (43 in 1960–61). While a Chelsea player, Greaves also became the youngest ever player to score 100 goals in the English top-flight, at 20 years and 290 days.

From 20 March 2004 to 26 October 2008, Chelsea went a record 86 consecutive league matches at home without defeat, beating the previous record of 63 matches unbeaten set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1980. Chelsea hold the English record for the fewest goals conceded during a league season (15), the highest number of clean sheets overall in a Premier League season (25) (both set during the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Premier%20League">2004–05 season</a>), and the most consecutive clean sheets from the start of a league season (6, set during the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20FA%20Premier%20League">2005–06 season</a>).

In May 2007, Chelsea were the first team to win the FA Cup at the new <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, having also been the last to win it at the old Wembley. They were the first English club to be ranked No. 1 under <a href="UEFA%20coefficient">UEFA's five-year coefficient</a> system in the 21st century. They were the first Premier League team, and the first team in the English top flight since 1962–63, to score at least 100 goals in a single season, reaching the milestone during the 2009–10 season. Chelsea is the only London club to have won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>. Upon winning the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2012–13 UEFA Europa League</a>, Chelsea became the first English club to <a href="European%20football%20records">win all four UEFA club trophies</a> and the only club to hold the Champions League and the Europa League at the same time.
Chelsea have broken the record for the <a href="Progression%20of%20British%20football%20transfer%20fee%20record">highest transfer fee paid by a British club</a> three times. Their £30.8 million purchase of <a href="Andriy%20Shevchenko">Andriy Shevchenko</a> from <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> in June 2006 was a British record until surpassed by the £32.5 million paid by Manchester City for <a href="Robinho">Robinho</a> in September 2008. The club's £50 million purchase of <a href="Fernando%20Torres">Fernando Torres</a> from Liverpool in January 2011 held the record until <a href="%C3%81ngel%20Di%20Mar%C3%ADa">Ángel Di María</a> signed for Manchester United in August 2014 for £59.7 million. The club's £71 million purchase of <a href="Kepa%20Arrizabalaga">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a> in August 2018 remains a <a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20association%20football%20transfers">world record fee paid for a goalkeeper</a>.
On 12 February 2022, Chelsea became the first London club to win the <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a> against <a href="Sociedade%20Esportiva%20Palmeiras">Palmeiras</a> with <a href="Kai%20Havertz">Kai Havertz</a> scoring a late penalty.

Ownership and finances.
Chelsea Football Club was founded by <a href="Gus%20Mears">Gus Mears</a> in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when <a href="Ken%20Bates">Ken Bates</a> bought the club from Mears' great-nephew <a href="Brian%20Mears">Brian Mears</a> for £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">AIM</a> stock exchange in March 1996. In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman <a href="Matthew%20Harding">Matthew Harding</a> became a director, and loaned the club £26 million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players.
In July 2003, <a href="Roman%20Abramovich">Roman Abramovich</a> purchased just over 50% of Chelsea Village plc's share capital, including Bates' 29.5% stake, for £30 million and over the following weeks bought out most of the remaining 12,000 shareholders at 35 pence per share, completing a £140 million takeover. Other shareholders at the time of the takeover included the <a href="Matthew%20Harding">Matthew Harding</a> estate (21%), <a href="BSkyB">BSkyB</a> (9.9%) and various anonymous offshore trusts.
At the time of the Abramovich takeover, the club also had debts of around £100 million, which included a 10-year £75 million <a href="Eurobond%20%28external%20bond%29">Eurobond</a> taken out in 1997 by the Bates regime to buy the freehold of Stamford Bridge and finance the redevelopment of the stadium. The 9% interest on the loan cost the club around £7 million a year and according to <a href="Bruce%20Buck">Bruce Buck</a>, Chelsea were struggling to pay an instalment due in July 2003. Abramovich paid off some of that debt immediately, but the outstanding £36 million on the Eurobond was not fully repaid until 2008. Since then, the club had no external debt.
Abramovich changed the ownership name to Chelsea FC plc, whose ultimate parent company was Fordstam Limited, which was controlled by him. Chelsea were additionally funded by Abramovich via interest free <a href="soft%20loan">soft loan</a>s channelled through his holding company Fordstam Limited. The loans stood at £709 million in December 2009, when they were all converted to <a href="Equity%20%28finance%29">equity</a> by Abramovich, leaving the club themselves debt free, although the debt remained with Fordstam.
Chelsea did not turn a profit in the first nine years of Abramovich's ownership, and made record losses of £140m in June 2005. In November 2012, Chelsea announced a profit of £1.4 million for the year ending 30 June 2012, the first time the club had made a profit under Abramovich's ownership. This was followed by a loss in 2013 and then their highest ever profit of £18.4 million for the year to June 2014. In 2018 Chelsea announced a record after-tax profit of £62 million.
Chelsea has been described as a global brand; a 2012 report by Brand Finance ranked Chelsea fifth among football brands and valued the club's brand value at US$398 million – an increase of 27% from the previous year, also valuing it at US$10 million more than the sixth best brand, London rivals Arsenal – and gave the brand a strength rating of AA (very strong). In 2016, "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" magazine ranked Chelsea the seventh most valuable football club in the world, at £1.15 billion ($1.66 billion). , Chelsea was ranked eighth in the <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">Deloitte Football Money League</a> with an annual commercial revenue of £322.59 million.
As of May 2022, Chelsea was ranked the eighth-most valuable club in the world according to "Forbes", and also eighth according to Deloitte, with an annual commercial revenue of €493.1 million.
The club's recent accounting records highlight £26.6m they lost in compensation to former head coach <a href="Antonio%20Conte">Antonio Conte</a> for sacking and to pay off his backroom staff and the legal costs that followed.
On 26 February 2022, during the <a href="Russo-Ukrainian%20War">Russo-Ukrainian War</a>, Abramovich handed over "stewardship and care" of Chelsea FC to the Chelsea Charitable Foundation. Abramovich released an official statement on 2 March 2022 confirming that he was selling the club due to the ongoing situation in Ukraine. Although the UK government froze Abramovich's assets in United Kingdom on 10 March due to his "close ties with Kremlin", it was made clear that the Chelsea club will be allowed to operate in terms of activities which are football related. On 12 March, the Premier League disqualified Abramovich as a director of Chelsea Football Club.
On 19 March 2022, there were five confirmed bids to acquire Chelsea FC: submitted to Raine Capital which was handling the sale of the club. Some of these were a consortium led by ex-Liverpool chairman Sir <a href="Martin%20Broughton">Martin Broughton</a>, a group of investors led by the Ricketts family (among them <a href="Joe%20Ricketts">Joe</a> and <a href="Pete%20Ricketts">Pete Ricketts</a>), Swiss and American businessmen <a href="Hansj%C3%B6rg%20Wyss">Hansjörg Wyss</a> and <a href="Todd%20Boehly">Todd Boehly</a>, Aethel Partners headed by Portuguese Ricardo Santos Silva and British businessman <a href="Nick%20Candy">Nick Candy</a>, supported by former Chelsea striker <a href="Gianluca%20Vialli">Gianluca Vialli</a>.
On 7 May, the club finally confirmed that "terms have been agreed" for a new ownership group led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital. On 30 May, it was confirmed that the Boehly consortium had completed the purchase of the club. The consortium also includes Wyss and <a href="Mark%20Walter">Mark Walter</a>. Walter and Boehly are also owners of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a>, and the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Sparks">Los Angeles Sparks</a>.

Following the introduction of sleeve sponsors in the Premier League, Chelsea had <a href="Alliance%20Tire%20Company">Alliance Tyres</a> as its first sleeve sponsor in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Chelsea%20F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a>, followed by <a href="Hyundai%20Motor%20Company">Hyundai Motor Company</a> in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Chelsea%20F.C.%20season">2018-19 season</a>. In <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Chelsea%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a>, Amber Group became the new sleeve sponsor, with the flagship digital asset platform WhaleFin appearing on the sleeves of both men's and women's teams.
The club also has a variety of other sponsors and official partners, which include <a href="Cadbury">Cadbury</a>, <a href="EA%20Sports">EA Sports</a>, <a href="FICO">FICO</a>, <a href="Hilton%20Worldwide">Hilton Worldwide</a>, <a href="3%20%28company%29">3 (company)</a>, <a href="Levy%20Restaurants">Levy Restaurants</a>, <a href="MSC%20Cruises">MSC Cruises</a>, <a href="Oman%20Air">Oman Air</a>, <a href="Parimatch">Parimatch</a>, <a href="Rexona">Rexona</a>, <a href="Singha">Singha</a>, <a href="The%20St.%20James%20%28sports%20complex%29">The St. James</a>, <a href="Trivago">Trivago</a> and BingX.
Popular culture.
In 1930, Chelsea featured in one of the earliest football films, "<a href="The%20Great%20Game%20%281930%20film%29">The Great Game</a>". One-time Chelsea centre forward, <a href="Jack%20Cock">Jack Cock</a>, who by then was playing for <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>, was the star of the film and several scenes were shot at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>, including on the pitch, the boardroom, and the <a href="dressing%20room">dressing room</a>s. It included guest appearances by then-Chelsea players <a href="Andrew%20Nesbit%20Wilson">Andrew Wilson</a>, <a href="George%20Mills%20%28footballer%29">George Mills</a>, and <a href="Sam%20Millington">Sam Millington</a>. Owing to the notoriety of the <a href="Chelsea%20Headhunters">Chelsea Headhunters</a>, a <a href="football%20firm">football firm</a> associated with the club, Chelsea have also featured in films about football <a href="hooliganism">hooliganism</a>, including 2004's "<a href="The%20Football%20Factory%20%28film%29">The Football Factory</a>". Chelsea also appeared in the <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> film "<a href="Jhoom%20Barabar%20Jhoom">Jhoom Barabar Jhoom</a>". In April 2011, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegrin</a> comedy series "Nijesmo mi od juče" made an episode in which Chelsea played against <a href="FK%20Sutjeska%20Nik%C5%A1i%C4%87">FK Sutjeska Nikšić</a> for qualification of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>.
Up until the 1950s, the club had a long-running association with the <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a>s; their underachievement often provided material for comedians such as <a href="George%20Robey">George Robey</a>. It culminated in comedian Norman Long's release of a <a href="Novelty%20song">comic song</a> in 1933, ironically titled "On the Day That Chelsea Went and Won the Cup", the lyrics of which describe a series of bizarre and improbable occurrences on the hypothetical day when Chelsea finally won a trophy. In <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s 1935 film "<a href="The%2039%20Steps%20%281935%20film%29">The 39 Steps</a>", Mr Memory claims that Chelsea last won the Cup in 63 BC, "in the presence of the <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20emperors">Emperor</a> <a href="Nero">Nero</a>." Scenes in a 1980 episode of "<a href="Minder%20%28TV%20series%29">Minder</a>" were filmed during a real match at Stamford Bridge between Chelsea and <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> with Terry McCann (<a href="Dennis%20Waterman">Dennis Waterman</a>) standing on the terraces.

Southampton F.C.

Southampton Football Club () is an English professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, that competes in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>, the second tier of <a href="Football%20in%20England">English football</a>. Its home ground since 2001 has been <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Stadium">St Mary's Stadium</a>, before which it was based at <a href="The%20Dell%20%28Southampton%29">The Dell</a>. The team play in red and white shirts. They have been nicknamed "The Saints" because of the club's beginnings as a church football team at <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Southampton">St Mary's Church</a>. Southampton shares a long-standing <a href="South%20Coast%20derby">South Coast derby</a> rivalry with <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>, in part due to geographic proximity and both cities' respective <a href="maritime%20history">maritime histories</a>.
Founded in 1885, the club joined the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> as Southampton St. Mary's in 1894, dropping the St. Mary's from their name three years later. Southampton won the Southern League on six occasions and were beaten <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> finalists in <a href="1900%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1900</a> and <a href="1902%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1902</a>, before being invited to become founder members of the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Football League Third Division</a> in 1920. They won promotion as <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> champions in 1921–22, remaining in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> for 31 years until they were relegated in 1953. Crowned Third Division champions under the stewardship of <a href="Ted%20Bates%20%28footballer%29">Ted Bates</a> in 1959–60, they were promoted into the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> at the end of the 1965–66 campaign. They played top-flight football for eight seasons, but won the FA Cup as a Second Division team in <a href="1976%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1976</a> with a 1–0 victory over <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Manager <a href="Lawrie%20McMenemy">Lawrie McMenemy</a> then took the club back into the top-flight with promotion in 1977–78.
Southampton were beaten finalists in the <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> in <a href="1979%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1979</a> and finished as runners-up in the First Division in 1983–84, three points behind <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. The club were founder members of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992 and reached another FA Cup final in <a href="2003%20FA%20Cup%20final">2003</a>. Relegation ended their 27 year stay in the top-flight in 2005, and they were relegated down to the third tier in 2009. Southampton won the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> in <a href="2010%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">2010</a> and won successive promotion from <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> and the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> in 2010–11 and 2011–12. After an 11-year stint in the top flight, during which they were EFL Cup runners-up in <a href="2017%20EFL%20Cup%20final">2017</a>, they were relegated in 2023.
History.
Foundation and Southern League (1885–1920).
Southampton were originally founded at <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Southampton">St. Mary's Church</a>, on 21 November 1885 by members of the St. Mary's Church of England Young Men's Association.
St. Mary's Y.M.A., as they were usually referred to in the local press, played most of their early games on <a href="Southampton%20Common">The Common</a> where games were frequently interrupted by pedestrians insistent on exercising their right to roam. More important matches, such as cup games, were played either at the <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Southampton">County Cricket Ground</a> in Northlands Road or the <a href="Antelope%20Ground">Antelope Cricket Ground</a> in St Mary's Road.
The club was originally known as St. Mary's Young Men's Association F.C. (usually abbreviated to "St. Mary's Y.M.A.") and then became simply St. Mary's F.C. in <a href="1887%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football">1887–88</a>, before adopting the name Southampton St. Mary's when the club joined the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> in 1894.
For the start of their League career, Saints signed several new players on professional contracts, including <a href="Charles%20Baker%20%28footballer%29">Charles Baker</a>, <a href="Alf%20Littlehales">Alf Littlehales</a> and <a href="Lachie%20Thomson">Lachie Thomson</a> from <a href="Stoke%20F.C.">Stoke</a> and <a href="Fred%20Hollands">Fred Hollands</a> from <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>. After winning the Southern League title in <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1896–97</a>, the club became a limited company and was renamed Southampton F.C.
Southampton won the Southern League championship for three years running between 1897 and 1899 and again in 1901, 1903 and 1904. During this time, they moved to a newly built £10,000 stadium called <a href="The%20Dell%2C%20Southampton">The Dell</a>, to the northwest of the city centre in 1898. Although they would spend the next 103 years there, the future was far from certain in those early days and the club had to rent the premises first before they could afford to buy the stadium in the early part of the 20th century. The club reached the first of their four <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a>s in <a href="1900%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1900</a>. On that day, they went down 4–0 to <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a> and two years later they would suffer a similar fate at the hands of <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> as they were beaten 2–1 in a replay of the <a href="1902%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1902 final</a>. Reaching those finals gave Southampton recognition, even internationally: in 1909, an <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> representative who played for affiliated team <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> purchased 50 Saints shirts during a trip to England, which were shared between the two squads. This early Southampton connection is the reason why the colours of both Spanish clubs became red and white, as they are nowadays.
Joining the Football League (1920–1966).
After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Southampton joined the newly formed Football League Third Division in 1920 which split into <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">South</a> and <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">North</a> sections a year later. The <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20in%20English%20football">1921–22 season</a> ended in triumph with promotion and marked the beginning of a 31-year stay in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>.
The <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20in%20English%20football">1922–23 season</a> was a unique "Even Season" – 14 wins, 14 draws and 14 defeats for 42 points, or one point per game. Goals for and against statistics were also equal and the team finished in mid-table.
In 1925 and 1927, they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 2–0 and 2–1 to Sheffield United and <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> respectively.
Southampton were briefly forced to switch home matches to the ground of their local rivals <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> at <a href="Fratton%20Park">Fratton Park</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> when a bomb landed on The Dell pitch in November 1940, leaving an 18-foot crater which damaged an underground culvert and flooded the pitch.
Promotion was narrowly missed in <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20in%20English%20football">1947–48</a> when they finished in third place, a feat repeated the following <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20in%20English%20football">season</a> (despite having an eight-point lead with eight games to play) whilst in <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20in%20English%20football">1949–50</a> they narrowly missed out on promotion to second placed Sheffield United. In the 1948–49 and 1949–50 seasons, <a href="Charlie%20Wayman">Charlie Wayman</a> scored 56 goals, but relegation in <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20in%20English%20football">1953</a> sent Southampton sliding back into Division 3 (South).
It took until <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20in%20English%20football">1960</a> for Southampton to regain Second Division status with <a href="Derek%20Reeves">Derek Reeves</a> plundering 39 of the champions' 106 league goals. On 27 April 1963, a crowd of 68,000 at <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a> saw them lose 1–0 to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the FA Cup semi-final.
Reaching the First Division and cup win (1966–1977).
In <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20in%20English%20football">1966</a>, <a href="Ted%20Bates%20%28footballer%29">Ted Bates</a>' team were promoted to the First Division as runners-up, with <a href="Martin%20Chivers">Martin Chivers</a> scoring 30 of Saints' 85 league goals.
For the following campaign <a href="Ron%20Davies%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201942%29">Ron Davies</a> arrived to score 43 goals in his first season. Saints stayed among the elite for eight years, with the highest finishing position being seventh place in 1968–69 and again in 1970–71. These finishes were high enough for them to qualify for the <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> in <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1969–70</a> (going out in Round 3 to <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>) and its successor, the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20UEFA%20Cup">1971–72</a>, when they went out in the first round to Athletic Bilbao.
In December 1973, Bates stood down to be replaced by his assistant <a href="Lawrie%20McMenemy">Lawrie McMenemy</a>. The Saints were one of the first victims of the new three-down relegation system in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20in%20English%20football">1974</a>.
Under McMenemy's management, Saints started to rebuild in the Second Division, capturing players such as <a href="Peter%20Osgood">Peter Osgood</a>, <a href="Jim%20McCalliog">Jim McCalliog</a>, <a href="Jim%20Steele%20%28footballer%29">Jim Steele</a> and <a href="Peter%20Rodrigues">Peter Rodrigues</a> (captain) and in 1976, Southampton reached the <a href="1976%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a>, playing Manchester United at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>, and beat much-fancied United 1–0 with a goal from <a href="Bobby%20Stokes">Bobby Stokes</a>. The following season, they played in Europe again in the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a>, reaching Round 3 where they lost 2–3 on aggregate to <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>.
Return to First Division (1977–1992).
In <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20in%20English%20football">1977–78</a>, captained by <a href="Alan%20Ball%20Jr.">Alan Ball</a>, Saints finished runners-up in the Second Division (behind <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>) and returned to the First Division. They finished comfortably in 14th place in their first season back in the top flight. The following season they returned to Wembley in the final of the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> where they acquitted themselves well, losing 3–2 to <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>.
In 1980, McMenemy made his biggest signing, capturing the <a href="European%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">European Footballer of the Year</a> <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a>. Although Keegan's Southampton career only lasted two years, Saints fielded an attractive side also containing Alan Ball, prolific goal-scorer Ted MacDougall, (who still holds the record for the largest number of goals in an FA Cup game – nine – for Bournemouth against Margate in an 11–0 win), MacDougall's strike partner at Bournemouth and <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>, <a href="Phil%20Boyer">Phil Boyer</a>, club stalwart <a href="Mick%20Channon">Mick Channon</a> and <a href="Charlie%20George">Charlie George</a> and in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20in%20English%20football">1980–81</a> they scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish. The following season, Kevin Keegan helped lift the club to the top of the First Division. Southampton led the league for over two months, taking top spot on 30 January 1982 and staying there (apart from one week) until 3 April 1982. But in a disappointing end to the season, in which Keegan was hampered by a back injury, Southampton won only two of their last nine games and finished seventh. The winners of a wide-open title race were Keegan's old club <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, who were crowned champions on the final day of the season. Keegan scored 26 of Southampton's 72 goals that season, but was then sold to Newcastle.
Southampton continued to progress under McMenemy's stewardship, and with a team containing <a href="Peter%20Shilton">Peter Shilton</a> (the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> goalkeeper), <a href="Nick%20Holmes%20%28footballer%29">Nick Holmes</a>, <a href="David%20Armstrong%20%28English%20footballer%29">David Armstrong</a>, striker <a href="Steve%20Moran">Steve Moran</a> and quick winger <a href="Danny%20Wallace%20%28footballer%29">Danny Wallace</a> reached their highest ever league finish as runners-up in <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20in%20English%20football">1983–84</a> (three points behind the champions Liverpool) as well as reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup losing 1–0 to <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> at <a href="Highbury%20Stadium">Highbury Stadium</a>. McMenemy then added experienced midfielder <a href="Jimmy%20Case">Jimmy Case</a> to his ranks.
They finished fifth the following year, but as a result of the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Disaster</a> all English clubs were banned from European competition: had it not been for this, then Southampton would have again qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>.
McMenemy left at the end of the 1984–85 season to be succeeded by <a href="Chris%20Nicholl">Chris Nicholl</a>, who was sacked after six years in charge despite preserving the club's top flight status. He was replaced by <a href="Ian%20Branfoot">Ian Branfoot</a>, who until the end of the 1990–91 season had been assistant manager to <a href="Steve%20Coppell">Steve Coppell</a> at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>. By this stage, a key player in the Southampton line-up was <a href="Guernsey">Guernsey</a>-born attacking midfielder/striker <a href="Matt%20Le%20Tissier">Matthew Le Tissier</a>, who broke into the first team in the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87 season</a>. He was voted <a href="PFA%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Young Player of the Year</a> in 1990 and later made eight appearances for the England team – he finally retired in 2002 at the age of 33. Another exciting young player to break into the Southampton team just after Le Tissier was <a href="Alan%20Shearer">Alan Shearer</a>, who at the age of 17 scored a hat-trick against Arsenal in a league match in April 1988. Shearer was a first team regular by 1990, and stayed with Southampton until July 1992, when he was sold to <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> for a national record of more than £3 million. He then became the most expensive footballer in the world when Blackburn sold him to Newcastle for £15 million in 1996. He also scored 30 times for England internationally.
Southampton in the Premier League (1992–2005).
Southampton were founding members of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992–93, but spent most of the next ten seasons struggling against relegation. In <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">1995–96</a>, Southampton finished 17th with 38 league points, avoiding relegation on goal difference. Two important wins during the final weeks of the season did much to ensure that Saints and not <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> would achieve Premiership survival. First came a 3–1 home win over eventual double winners <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, then came a 1–0 away win over relegated Bolton Wanderers. Former Liverpool and <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> manager <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a>, was brought in, signing foreign players such as <a href="Egil%20%C3%98stenstad">Egil Østenstad</a> and <a href="Eyal%20Berkovic">Eyal Berkovic</a>. The highlight of the season was a 6–3 win over Manchester United at The Dell in October, when both his signings scored twice. Souness resigned after just one season in charge, being replaced by <a href="Dave%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201956%29">Dave Jones</a> who had won promotion to Division One with <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> as well as reaching the League Cup semi-finals.
In <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">1998–99</a>, they were rooted to the bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season but again avoided relegation on the last day of the season after a late run of good results, helped by the intervention of Latvian <a href="Marians%20Pahars">Marian Pahars</a> and old hero Le Tissier (The so-called "Great Escape"). In 1999, Southampton were given the go-ahead to build a new 32,000-seat stadium in the St Mary's area of the city, having been playing in the Dell since 1898. The stadium had been converted to an all-seater format earlier in the decade, but had a capacity of less than 16,000 and was unsuitable for further expansion.
During the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, Dave Jones quit as Southampton manager to concentrate on a court case after he was accused of abusing children at the children's home where he had worked during the 1980s. The accusations were later proved to be groundless, but it was too late to save Jones' career as Southampton manager and he was succeeded by ex-England manager <a href="Glenn%20Hoddle">Glenn Hoddle</a>. Hoddle helped keep Southampton well clear of the Premier League drop zone but having received an offer he moved to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> just before the end of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">2000–01 season</a>. He was replaced by first-team coach <a href="Stuart%20Gray%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201960%29">Stuart Gray</a>, who oversaw the relocation to the St Mary's Stadium for the 2001–02 season. At the end of the 2000–01 season, in the last competitive match at The Dell, Matthew Le Tissier came on late to score the last ever league goal at the old stadium with a half volley on the turn in a 3–2 win against Arsenal. Gray was sacked after a poor start to the following season, and he was replaced by ex-<a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a> manager <a href="Gordon%20Strachan">Gordon Strachan</a>, who steered Southampton to safety and a secure 11th-place finish.
In <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">2002–03</a>, Southampton finished eighth in the league and finished <a href="2003%20FA%20Cup%20Final">runners-up in the FA Cup</a> to Arsenal (after losing 1–0 at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a>), thanks in no small part to the metamorphosis of <a href="James%20Beattie%20%28footballer%29">James Beattie</a>, who fired home 24 goals, 23 in the league. Strachan resigned in March 2004 and within eight months, two managers – <a href="Paul%20Sturrock">Paul Sturrock</a> and <a href="Steve%20Wigley">Steve Wigley</a> – had come and gone. Chairman <a href="Rupert%20Lowe">Rupert Lowe</a> risked the ire of Saints fans when he appointed <a href="Harry%20Redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a> as manager on 8 December 2004, just after his resignation at <a href="South%20Coast%20of%20England">South Coast</a> rivals Portsmouth. He brought in a number of new signings, including his son <a href="Jamie%20Redknapp">Jamie</a> in the attempt to survive relegation. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League on the last day of the season, ending 27 successive seasons of top flight football for the club. Their relegation was ironically confirmed by a 2–1 home defeat to Manchester United, who had been on the receiving end of many upsets by Southampton over the years, namely in the 1976 FA Cup final and since then on a number of occasions in the league, as well as inflicting a heavy defeat on them in a November 1986 League Cup tie which cost United manager <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a> his job.
Lowe and Southampton continued to make headlines after former <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a> Rugby World Cup-winning coach <a href="Clive%20Woodward">Sir Clive Woodward</a> joined the club—eventually being appointed technical director in June 2005.
Outside the top flight (2005–2012).
In November 2005, manager Harry Redknapp resigned to rejoin Portsmouth, and was replaced by <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a>. Rupert Lowe resigned as chairman in June 2006, and Jersey-based businessman <a href="Michael%20Wilde">Michael Wilde</a>, who had become the club's major shareholder assumed the post. Following a club record £6 million being spent on transfers, Polish strikers <a href="Grzegorz%20Rasiak">Grzegorz Rasiak</a> and <a href="Marek%20Saganowski">Marek Saganowski</a> performed well and the season saw the introduction of 17-year-old <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Full-back">left-back</a> <a href="Gareth%20Bale">Gareth Bale</a>. Southampton finished in sixth place and lost the play-off semi-final to Derby County on penalties. The board sought new investment in the club, and in February 2007, Wilde stepped down as chairman to be replaced by local businessman <a href="Leon%20Crouch">Leon Crouch</a> as "Acting chairman", a role Crouch retained until 21 July 2007. In the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>, George Burley revealed that players such as Bale and <a href="Kenwyne%20Jones">Kenwyne Jones</a> had to be sold to stop the club going into administration and that failing to achieve promotion had put the club in serious financial difficulty. Burley left the club in January 2008 to take over as <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> manager and was replaced by <a href="Nigel%20Pearson">Nigel Pearson</a> who saved the club from relegation on the final day.
In July 2008 all the board members except one resigned, allowing Lowe and Wilde to return: Wilde as chairman of Southampton FC and Rupert Lowe as chairman of Southampton Leisure Holdings plc. Although Pearson kept the team up, the board did not renew his contract due to financial constraints, and the relatively unknown Dutchman <a href="Jan%20Poortvliet">Jan Poortvliet</a> was appointed manager. Financial troubles continued to mount, resulting in more players being sold or loaned out and parts of St Mary's were closed off to reduce costs. In January 2009, Poortvliet resigned with the club one place from bottom of the Championship, with <a href="Mark%20Wotte">Mark Wotte</a> taking over managerial duties.
In April 2009, Southampton's parent company was placed in <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>. A 10-point penalty was imposed, but as the team was already being relegated due to finishing second from bottom of the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Football League Championship</a> this points deduction had to apply to the 2009–10 season. By the end of May, the club was unable to meet its staff wages and asked employees to work unpaid as a gesture of goodwill. The administrator warned that the club faced imminent bankruptcy unless a buyer was found. In June, administrator Mark Fry confirmed negotiations with two groups of investors, followed by confirmation that the club had been sold to an overseas buyer "owned and controlled by <a href="Markus%20Liebherr">Markus Liebherr</a>". Liebherr brought in Italian businessman <a href="Nicola%20Cortese">Nicola Cortese</a> to look after the club's business interests on his behalf. In July 2009, with the club in the control of the new owner, Wotte was sacked as head coach and <a href="Alan%20Pardew">Alan Pardew</a> was appointed as the new first team manager. The Saints made their first big signing under Liebherr, striker <a href="Rickie%20Lambert">Rickie Lambert</a>, who was purchased on 10 August from League One side <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>.
Southampton started the 2009–10 season in League One, in the third tier of English football for the first time in 50 years and with −10 points. In March 2010, Southampton won their first trophy since 1976 when they defeated <a href="Carlisle%20United%20F.C.">Carlisle United</a> 4–1 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a> to claim the <a href="2010%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">Football League Trophy</a>. Southampton finished the season in seventh place, seven points from the last play-off position.
A new home shirt was unveiled on 10 June 2010, in celebration of the club's 125th anniversary. The design was based on the original St. Mary's Y.M.A. kit used in 1885; it featured the new anniversary crest and was without a sponsor's logo. On 11 August, it was announced that Liebherr had died; however, the club's future had been assured and planned for before his death.
 Pardew was dismissed in August and <a href="Nigel%20Adkins">Nigel Adkins</a> joined from <a href="Scunthorpe%20United%20F.C.">Scunthorpe United</a> as his replacement. The club was promoted to the Championship in May 2011 as runners-up to Brighton & Hove Albion.
Returning to the Championship for the 2011–12 season, Southampton made their best start to a season for 75 years with a winning run at St. Mary's of 13 league games, setting a new club record and going top of the league. In April 2012, Southampton achieved promotion to the Premier League as runners-up to <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>. The final game of the season set a record attendance at St Mary's Stadium of 32,363. Lambert finished the season as the Championship's top goalscorer with 27 league goals, his third "Golden Boot" in four seasons. He also won the "Championship Player of the Year" award.
Return to the Premier League (2012–2023).
Southampton returned to the Premier League for season 2012–13 initially under Nigel Adkins. Substantial sums were spent to strengthen the playing squad, but early in the season, Adkins was replaced by Argentine coach <a href="Mauricio%20Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a>. Southampton finished the season in 14th place, and <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">next season</a> in eighth.
At the end of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">2013–14 season</a>, Pochettino departed the club for Tottenham. The club subsequently appointed <a href="Ronald%20Koeman">Ronald Koeman</a> as his replacement on a three-year contract, and made several high-profile sales over the summer. In the final game of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a>, a 6–1 victory against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, <a href="Sadio%20Man%C3%A9">Sadio Mané</a> scored three goals in the space of 176 seconds, the fastest hat-trick in the history of the Premier League. The club finished seventh, then their highest ever Premier League rank, therefore qualifying for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2015–16 UEFA Europa League</a>. After defeating <a href="SBV%20Vitesse">Vitesse</a>, the Saints were eliminated in the play-off by <a href="FC%20Midtjylland">Midtjylland</a>. The following season, Southampton once again set new records for the club at the end of the season, finishing in sixth place. They once again qualified for the Europa League, although this time immediately entered the group stages, as opposed to the play-off rounds.
In June 2016, Koeman left Southampton to join Everton and <a href="Claude%20Puel">Claude Puel</a> replaced him on a three-year contract. The club were eliminated in the group stage of the Europa League but were more successful in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20EFL%20Cup">EFL Cup</a>, where they lost 3–2 in the <a href="2017%20EFL%20Cup%20final">final</a> to Manchester United. The club ended the 2016–17 season in eighth. During the summer, Puel was replaced as manager by Argentine coach <a href="Mauricio%20Pellegrino">Mauricio Pellegrino</a>, previously of <a href="Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s">Deportivo Alavés</a>. In mid-season, the club sold Dutch defender <a href="Virgil%20van%20Dijk">Virgil van Dijk</a> to Liverpool for an estimated £75 million, Southampton's record sale and a world record for his position. Pellegrino was sacked in March 2018 with the team 1 point above the relegation zone, and his replacement, former player, <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a>, guided the club to a 17th-place finish, avoiding relegation on the last day of the season. Hughes signed a new contract at the end of the season but a poor start to the following season led to him being sacked in December with the team in 18th place. He was replaced with former <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> boss <a href="Ralph%20Hasenh%C3%BCttl">Ralph Hasenhüttl</a>, who steered the club away from relegation to finish 16th.
In August 2017, Southampton Football Club confirmed that the Chinese businessman Gao Jisheng had completed a multimillion-pound takeover of the club, acquiring an 80% stake for around £210m after successfully passing the relevant checks, including the Premier League's owners and directors test. The deal followed more than 12 months of talks between the Gao family and the south coast club. The investment was made personally by Gao and his daughter Nelly as opposed to being sanctioned through Lander Sports, as originally mooted. Hangzhou-based Lander is the family's business arm, which develops, constructs and manages sports sites.
Southampton suffered their worst ever defeat on 25 October 2019, losing <a href="Southampton%20F.C.%200%E2%80%939%20Leicester%20City%20F.C.">9–0</a> to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> at home, this would later be replicated on <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.%209-0%20Southampton%20F.C.">2 February 2021 against Manchester United at Old Trafford</a> in the following campaign, albeit under different circumstances. It is tied with <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>'s defeat by <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in 1995 as the biggest defeat since the Premier League's inception. Following universal backlash toward the team's performance, the players and coaching staff refused their wages from the match and instead donated them to the Saints Foundation. On 9 April 2020, Southampton became the first Premier League club to defer players' salaries, during the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Despite a poor start that saw them in the relegation zone as late as November, Southampton improved greatly as the season went on, ending the year with a seven-game unbeaten streak to finish 11th in the league. Their final tally of 52 points was the team's highest total since 2015–16.
The club's good run continued in the 2020–21 season with the Saints sitting in third after 13 games. The team also had a successful run in the FA Cup where they reached the semi-finals, losing to eventual winners Leicester City. In November, Southampton briefly led the Premier League table. However, despite the outstanding start to the season, a mid-season loss of form and an accumulation of injuries which decimated the senior squad ranks, due in part to the unavailability of much of the club's training facilities resulting from the restrictions imposed during the second <a href="COVID-19%20lockdowns">lockdown</a> in England. As a consequence of this, Hasenhüttl was forced to field many of the club's youth players in an attempt to fill in the gaps in his senior squad. After an impressive run during the first half of the season, Southampton would eventually finish in 15th place. In January 2022, Gao sold his 80% stake to <a href="Sport%20Republic">Sport Republic</a>, a group financed by Serbian <a href="Dragan%20%C5%A0olak%20%28Businessman%29">Dragan Šolak</a> for £100m. Despite most pundits predicting them to be relegated at the start of the season, Southampton finished the 2021–22 season in 15th place for the second consecutive year.
In November 2022, it was announced Southampton had parted company with manager Ralph Hasenhüttl after four years, to be replaced by <a href="Nathan%20Jones%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Nathan Jones</a>. On 12 February 2023, Jones was sacked following a disappointing run of results during which the Saints lost seven out of eight league matches, leaving them bottom of the Premier League table. After having served as caretaker manager in a 1–0 victory over <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Sell%C3%A9s">Rubén Sellés</a>, who had joined Southampton as first-team lead coach in June 2022, was announced as Jones's replacement on 24 February on a contract until the end of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">2022–23 season</a>. Sellés was unable to save the Saints' season, and the team were officially relegated on 13 May, following a 2–0 home loss to <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>. On 24 May 2023, Southampton confirmed that they would not renew the contract of Sellés when it expired at the end of the season.
Relegation to the Championship (2023–present).
On 21 June 2023, the club appointed <a href="Russell%20Martin%20%28footballer%29">Russell Martin</a> as manager on a three-year contract.
Club identity.
Ten companies have sponsored the players' shirts since shirt advertising was permitted in English football. The first company to do so was photocopier manufacturer <a href="Rank%20Xerox">Rank Xerox</a> which sponsored the club for three years from 1980. Other sponsors have been <a href="Air%20Florida">Air Florida</a> (1983), <a href="Draper%20Tools">Draper Tools</a> (1984–93), <a href="Dimplex">Dimplex</a> (1993–95), Sanderson (1995–99), <a href="Friends%20Provident">Friends Provident</a> (1999–2006), <a href="Flybe%20%281979-2020%29">Flybe</a> (2006–10), aap3 (2011–14), Veho (2014–16), <a href="Virgin%20Media">Virgin Media</a>. (2016–19) and LD Sports (2019–20). Since 2020 the shirt sponsor is <a href="TGP%20Europe">Sportsbet.io</a>. In addition, Virgin Media was Southampton's sleeve sponsor from 2017–22. <a href="JD%20Sports">JD Sports</a> was the sleeve sponsor for the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Southampton%20F.C.%20season">2022–23</a> season.
Since 2021, Southampton's kits have been manufactured by <a href="Hummel%20International">Hummel</a>, which previously manufactured Southampton's kits between 1987 and 1991. Previous manufacturers have included <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> (1974–76, 2008–13), <a href="Admiral%20Sportswear">Admiral</a> (1976–80, 1991–93), <a href="Patrick%20%28sportswear%20company%29">Patrick</a> (1980–87), <a href="Pony%20International">Pony</a> (1993–99), <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> (2013–14, 2015–16) and <a href="Under%20Armour">Under Armour</a> (2016–21). From 1999 to 2008 and in 2014–15 the club used its own brand, Saints.
Anthem.
The Saints' anthem is the popular sports tune "<a href="When%20the%20Saints%20Go%20Marching%20In%20%28sports%20tune%29">When the Saints Go Marching In</a>", and since the club's official nickname is "the Saints", they are one of only a few teams who do not change the original lyric.
Crest.
Originally, the club used the same crest as the one used by the city itself. However, in 1974 a competition was run for fans to design a new one.
The winning design, designed by Rolland Parris, was used for around 20 years, before being modified slightly by Southampton design agency The Graphics Workshop in the 1990s for copyright reasons.
From top-to-bottom, the halo is a reference to the nickname "Saints", the ball to the nature of the club, the scarf to the fans and the team colours. The tree represents the nearby <a href="New%20Forest">New Forest</a> and <a href="Southampton%20Common">Southampton Common</a>, with the water representing Southampton's connections with the rivers, seas and oceans. Below that is a white rose – the symbol of the city which is also present on the city coat of arms. In the mid-1990s the ball was changed from a vintage style ball (such as those used in the 1960s) to the current ball with black and white panels, for copyright reasons.
On 13 May 2010, the official crest for the 125th anniversary was released: "The black outline and halo feature will now appear in gold, whilst the all important years 1885 and 2010 are scripted either side of the shield, with the figure 125 replacing the ball". The badge was used on Southampton's shirts for the 2010–11 season.
Stadium and training facilities.
The club's first home ground was the <a href="Antelope%20Ground">Antelope Ground</a> from 1887 to 1896. Followed by the <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Southampton">County Cricket Ground</a> from 1896 to 1898.
From 1898 to 2001, Southampton played their home games at <a href="The%20Dell%2C%20Southampton">The Dell</a>. The purpose-built stadium was redeveloped a number of times through its 103-year history, with two of the stands being completely rebuilt after fires and in 1950 it became the first ground in England to have permanent floodlighting installed. Following the <a href="Taylor%20report">Taylor report</a>, The Dell was converted to an all-seater stadium and, with a capacity of approximately 15,000, became the smallest ground in England's top-flight, precipitating a move to a new home.
St Mary's Stadium has been home to the Saints since August 2001. It has a capacity of 32,689 and is one of only a handful of stadia in Europe to meet <a href="UEFA%20stadium%20categories">UEFA's Four Star criteria</a>. The stadium has also been host to a number of international games. The ground's record attendance is 32,363, set in a game between Southampton and <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a> in April 2012.
The club's training facilities, <a href="Staplewood%20Campus">Staplewood Campus</a>, are located in <a href="Marchwood">Marchwood</a> on the edge of the <a href="New%20Forest">New Forest</a>. The current facilities were opened in November 2014, at a cost of circa £40m. The main building was named after the club's late owner, <a href="Markus%20Liebherr">Markus Liebherr</a>.
For the 2012–13 season until the end of the 2013–14 season, the club agreed a deal with <a href="Eastleigh%20F.C.">Eastleigh F.C.</a>, currently of the <a href="Conference%20South">Conference South</a>, for the use of their stadium, <a href="Ten%20Acres">Ten Acres</a>, for The Saints' U21 team fixtures. This continues a partnership with Eastleigh that has lasted for the last decade. This partnership though ended and Southampton's youth teams continued to play at Staplewood and St. Mary's until the 2019–20 season when some U23 cup games were to be played at <a href="A.F.C.%20Totton">A.F.C. Totton</a>'s Testwood Stadium, where <a href="Southampton%20F.C.%20Women">Southampton F.C. Women</a> play their home matches.
Rivalries.
The South Coast Derby is the name given to matches between the Saints and their fierce nearby rivals, <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth F.C.</a>, from the city of the <a href="Portsmouth">same name</a>, 19 miles (31 km) from Southampton. The south coast derbies are also referred to as the Hampshire derby. Including Southern League games, there have been 71 games between the two clubs, with Southampton winning 35 and Portsmouth 21.

The Saints U21s and Academy.
Southampton runs a highly successful youth academy, with a number of teams from ages eight to 21 years. Recent products of the club's youth system include <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> internationals <a href="Adam%20Lallana">Adam Lallana</a>, <a href="Alex%20Oxlade-Chamberlain">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a>, <a href="James%20Ward-Prowse">James Ward-Prowse</a>, <a href="Calum%20Chambers">Calum Chambers</a>, <a href="Luke%20Shaw">Luke Shaw</a> and <a href="Theo%20Walcott">Theo Walcott</a>; <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a> international winger <a href="Gareth%20Bale">Gareth Bale</a>; and <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Ireland</a> international striker <a href="Michael%20Obafemi">Michael Obafemi</a>.
Controversy.
Historic sexual abuse prosecutions.
In December 2016, as the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20football%20sexual%20abuse%20scandal">United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal</a> expanded, former Southampton trainees Dean Radford, Jamie Webb and, later, Billy Seymour told the BBC about incidents they said happened when they were in their teens. By 4 December 2016, six players had alleged abuse by an ex-Southampton employee, subsequently named as Bob Higgins. He had been dismissed by Southampton in 1989 after allegations were made against him, and in 1991 he was charged with six counts of indecent assault against young boys he had been coaching; at the trial at <a href="Southampton%20Crown%20Court">Southampton Crown Court</a>, he was acquitted on the direction of the judge when the prosecution offered no evidence. Higgins then worked as a youth coach at <a href="Peterborough%20United%20F.C.">Peterborough United F.C.</a> in the mid-1990s,<ref name="James/Morris-05Dec2016"></ref> and was investigated as part of a 1997 Channel 4 "Dispatches" investigation, when he denied allegations of abuse.
On 5 July 2017, Higgins was charged with 65 counts of indecent assault. The offences were alleged to have taken place in the 1980s and 1990s and to have involved 23 alleged victims. On 23 July 2018, after a trial at <a href="Salisbury%20Crown%20Court">Salisbury Crown Court</a>, Higgins was found guilty of one charge of indecent assault, and not guilty of another count of the same offence, while the jury failed to reach verdicts on 48 other counts of the same charge. After a 2019 retrial, on 51 counts of indecent assault, at <a href="Bournemouth%20Crown%20Court">Bournemouth Crown Court</a>, Higgins was found guilty of 45 charges of indecent assault against teenage boys, not guilty of five counts of indecent assault, with the jury unable to reach a verdict on one final count. He was sentenced to 24 years and three months in prison.
The FA's Sheldon Review, published in March 2021, identified failures to act adequately on complaints or rumours of sexual abuse at clubs including Southampton. In November 2021, a report by the children's charity <a href="Barnardo%27s">Barnardo's</a> criticised Southampton for missing opportunities to prevent Higgins from abusing schoolboy footballers: "adults in Southampton Football Club during the time Higgins worked for them or on their behalf did not consider the welfare and wellbeing of the boys involved with the club as their prime consideration." It said the damage caused was "incalculable" and "devastating". Southampton issued a deep apology, admitting it had "completely failed to protect so many young people from suffering abuse over a long period of time".

Having won the <a href="West%20London%20League">West London League</a> in 1898–99, they joined both the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> and <a href="Western%20Football%20League">Western League</a>. Having won titles in both leagues, they were elected to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1920. They played in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> until winning promotion as champions in 1947–48. Relegated in 1952, they won the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> and <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cup</a> in the <a href="1967%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1966–67</a> season under the stewardship of <a href="Alec%20Stock">Alec Stock</a>. Promoted from the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in 1967–68, they were relegated after one season in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>. QPR won promotion again in 1972–73 and then were runners-up to the <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">English football champions</a> in 1975–76 after finishing one point behind <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>.

QPR won another Second Division title in 1982–83 and were beaten finalists in the <a href="1986%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1986 League Cup final</a>. They remained in the top-flight for thirteen years, becoming founder members of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992, before they were relegated in 1996. Relegated again in 2001, they secured promotion from the third tier at the end of the 2003–04 campaign. QPR won promotion as winners of the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> in 2010–11, though were relegated from the Premier League after two seasons. They won an immediate promotion via the play-offs in <a href="2014%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20final">2014</a>, though were relegated again the following season and have remained in the Championship since that time.
After a nomadic early existence, they have played home matches at <a href="Loftus%20Road">MATrade Loftus Road</a> since 1917, other than two brief spells at the <a href="White%20City%20Stadium">White City Stadium</a>. They share rivalries with various other clubs; most notably they contest the <a href="West%20London%20derby">West London derby</a>.
History.
1880s–1970s.
The club was formed in 1886, when a team known as St Jude's (formed in 1884) merged with Christchurch Rangers (formed in 1882). The resulting team was called Queen's Park Rangers and their official formation date is considered to be 1882, which is the original founding date of Christchurch Rangers. The club's name came from the fact most of the players came from the <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%2C%20London">Queen's Park</a> area of west London. St Jude's Institute on Ilbert Street W10 is still in use as a community hall and in July 2011 club icon <a href="Stan%20Bowles">Stan Bowles</a> unveiled a plaque celebrating its place in history.
QPR became a professional team in 1889. The club were elected into the Southern Football League in <a href="1899-1900%20Southern%20Football%20League">1899</a>. In 1899-1900 they put themselves on the map after qualifying for the first round proper of the FA Cup by beating Wolverhampton Wanderers on their own ground 1-0. The Guardian said "the hitherto unknown Queens Park Rangers, a team hailing from the north-west suburbs of London...upset all calculations." 
They first won the Southern Football League in <a href="Southern%20Football%20League%23Past%20Southern%20League%20winners">1907–08</a>. As Southern League champions that year, they played in the first ever <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield%23History">Charity Shield</a> match, against the Football League champions, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. The club <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield%23History">lost</a> 4–0 in a replay after the first game had finished 1–1. Both games were played at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>. QPR were Southern League champions for a second time in <a href="1911-12%20Southern%20Football%20League">1911-12</a>.
The club joined the Football League in <a href="1920-21%20Football%20League">1920</a>, when the Third Division was formed, mainly with <a href="1919-20%20Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League clubs</a>. When the Third Division was split into North and South <a href="1921-22%20Football%20League">the following season</a>, QPR, like most of the former Southern League clubs that had joined the Football League to form the Third Division, were in the Third Division (South).
QPR played their home games in nearly 20 different stadia (a league record), before permanently settling at <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a> in 1917, although the team would briefly attempt to attract larger crowds by playing at the <a href="White%20City%20Stadium">White City Stadium</a> for two short spells: 1931 to 1933, and the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1962–63</a> season.
The club were promoted as champions of Division 3 South in the 1947–48 season. <a href="Dave%20Mangnall">Dave Mangnall</a> was the manager as the club participated in four seasons of the Second Division, being relegated in 1951–52. <a href="Tony%20Ingham">Tony Ingham</a> was signed from <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> and went on to make the most ever league appearances for QPR (519). Arguably the club's greatest ever manager, <a href="Alec%20Stock">Alec Stock</a>, arrived prior to the start of the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20in%20English%20football">1959–60</a> season. The <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a> season saw QPR achieve their biggest win to date: 9–2 vs <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers">Tranmere Rovers</a> in a Division 3 match. In time, Stock, together with <a href="Jim%20Gregory%20%28football%20chairman%29">Jim Gregory</a> who arrived as chairman in the mid-1960s, helped to achieve a total transformation of the club and its surroundings.
In <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20in%20English%20football">1966–67</a>, QPR won the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three</a> championship and became the first Third Division club to win the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> on Saturday, 4 March 1967, beating <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> 3–2, coming back from a two-goal deficit. It is still the only major trophy that QPR have won. It was also the first League Cup final to be held at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. After winning promotion in 1968 to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">top flight</a> for the first time in their history, Rangers were relegated after just one season and spent the next four years in <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a>. <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a> joined from Spurs at the beginning of the 1969–70 season and <a href="Rodney%20Marsh%20%28footballer%29">Rodney Marsh</a> was sold to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. During this time, new QPR heroes emerged including <a href="Phil%20Parkes%20%28footballer%20born%201950%29">Phil Parkes</a>, <a href="Don%20Givens">Don Givens</a>, <a href="Dave%20Thomas%20%28footballer%20born%201950%29">Dave Thomas</a> and Stan Bowles. These new signings were in addition to home-grown talent such as <a href="Dave%20Clement">Dave Clement</a>, <a href="Ian%20Gillard">Ian Gillard</a>, <a href="Mick%20Leach">Mick Leach</a> and <a href="Gerry%20Francis">Gerry Francis</a>.
In 1974, <a href="Dave%20Sexton">Dave Sexton</a> joined as manager and, in 1975–76 led QPR to the runners-up spot in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, missing out on the championship by one point with a squad containing seven <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> internationals and internationals from the <a href="home%20nations">home nations</a>. After completing their 42-game season, QPR sat at the top of the league, one point ahead of <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> who went on to defeat <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> to clinch the title. Wolves were relegated to the Second Division that same season. The late 1970s also saw some cup success with Rangers reaching the semi-finals of the <a href="League%20Cup">League Cup</a> and in their first entry into European football reached the quarter-finals of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> losing to <a href="AEK%20Athens%20F.C.">AEK Athens</a> on penalties. Following Sexton's departure in 1977 the club eventually slipped into the Second Division in 1979.
1980s–1990s.
In 1980, Terry Venables took over as manager and in 1981 the club installed an <a href="artificial%20turf">artificial turf</a> pitch. In 1982 QPR, still playing in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, reached the <a href="1982%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> for the only time in the club's history, facing holders <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. Tottenham won 1–0 in a replay. <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">The following season</a> QPR went on to win the Second Division championship and returned to English football's top division. After a respectable fifth-place finish, and <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> qualification, the following year, Venables departed to become manager of <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. In 1988 the club had a new chairman, 24-year-old Richard Thompson. Over the next seven years, various managers came and went from <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a> and the club spent many seasons finishing mid table but avoided relegation. The most successful season during this period was the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Football%20League">1987–88</a> season in which QPR finished fifth, missing out on a UEFA Cup campaign due to the ban on English clubs in European competition as a result of the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>. They were also runners up in the <a href="1986%20Football%20League%20Cup%20final">1986 League Cup</a>, losing to <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a>.
Gerry Francis, a key player in the 1970s QPR side who had proved himself as a successful manager with <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>, was appointed manager in the summer of 1991. In the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.%20season">1991–92</a> First Division campaign they finished mid-table in the league and were founder members of the new <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, finishing fifth, as top London club, in the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.%20season">1992–93</a> inaugural season. Francis oversaw one of QPR's most famous victories, the 4–1 win at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28football%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a> in front of live TV on New Year's Day 1992. Midway through the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95</a> season Francis resigned and very quickly became manager of <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and <a href="Ray%20Wilkins">Ray Wilkins</a> was installed as <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a>. Wilkins led QPR to an eighth-place finish in the Premiership. In July 1995 the club's top goalscorer, <a href="Les%20Ferdinand">Les Ferdinand</a>, was sold for a club record fee of £6 million to <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>.
QPR struggled throughout the following season and were relegated at the end of the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96 season</a>. QPR then competed in Division 1 until 2001 under a succession of managers. Gerry Francis returned in 1998; however, the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–2001 season</a> proved to be a disaster, and Francis resigned in early 2001.
2000–present.
Former player <a href="Ian%20Holloway">Ian Holloway</a> became manager, but was unable to stop Rangers from being relegated to England's third tier for the first time for more than 30 years. Following the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04 season</a> QPR returned to Division 1 and struggled for consistent form over the next two campaigns before Holloway was suspended amidst rumors of his impending departure for <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>. A poor series of results and lack of progress at the club saw Holloway's successors <a href="Gary%20Waddock">Gary Waddock</a> and later <a href="John%20Gregory%20%28footballer%29">John Gregory</a> – both former players – fail to hold on to the manager's job.
During this same period, QPR became embroiled in financial and boardroom controversy. Although the club had floated on the <a href="Alternative%20Investment%20Market">Alternative Investment Market</a> in 1991, in 2001 it entered <a href="administration%20%28insolvency%29">administration</a> (receivership). A period of financial hardship followed and the club left administration after receiving a £10m high-interest emergency loan which continued to burden the club. Scandals involving the directors, shareholders and others emerged in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06 season</a> and included allegations of blackmail and threats of violence against the club's chairman <a href="Gianni%20Paladini">Gianni Paladini</a>. In an unrelated incident, QPR were further rocked by the murder of youth team player <a href="Kiyan%20Prince">Kiyan Prince</a> on 18 May 2006 and, in August 2007, the death of teenager and promising first-team player <a href="Ray%20Jones%20%28footballer%20born%201988%29">Ray Jones</a> in a car crash.
Following this low point in the club's history as Rangers also faced mounting financial pressure, in the same month it was announced that the club had been bought by wealthy <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> businessmen <a href="Flavio%20Briatore">Flavio Briatore</a> and <a href="Bernie%20Ecclestone">Bernie Ecclestone</a> (see "<a href="%23Ownership%20and%20finances">Ownership and finances</a>" below). During the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08</a> season, Rangers competed in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Football League Championship</a> (see also: <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season</a>). John Gregory's reign as manager came to an end in October 2007 after a string of poor results left QPR at the bottom of the Championship and he was replaced by <a href="Luigi%20De%20Canio">Luigi De Canio</a> until the end of the 2007–08 season. Further investment followed in early 2008 as the club looked to push for promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> within four years, on the back of greater financial stability. On 14 May 2008, <a href="Iain%20Dowie">Iain Dowie</a> was announced as the manager to begin the campaign to return Rangers to the top flight. However, on 24 October 2008 Dowie was sacked after just 15 games in charge of the club.
On 19 November 2008, QPR named former Portugal midfielder <a href="Paulo%20Sousa">Paulo Sousa</a> as their new first team coach. However, on 9 April 2009, his contract was terminated after he allegedly divulged confidential information without authority. On the same day as Sousa's sacking, player/coach <a href="Gareth%20Ainsworth">Gareth Ainsworth</a> was appointed as player/caretaker manager for a second time. In June 2009 <a href="Jim%20Magilton">Jim Magilton</a> was named as new manager of QPR. Despite leading QPR to a good start to the 2009–10 season, a loss of form combined with an alleged head-butting incident with Hungarian midfielder <a href="%C3%81kos%20Buzs%C3%A1ky">Ákos Buzsáky</a> saw the club further embroiled in controversy. Magilton left the club by mutual consent on 16 December 2009, along with his assistant <a href="John%20Gorman%20%28footballer%29">John Gorman</a>. They were replaced by <a href="Paul%20Hart">Paul Hart</a> and <a href="Mick%20Harford">Mick Harford</a> on the next day. Less than a month and only five games after becoming manager at QPR, Hart parted with the club on 14 January 2010; the reasons for his leaving the club were unstated.
On 30 April 2011, QPR secured promotion to the Premier League by winning the Championship with a 2–0 win over <a href="Watford%20FC">Watford</a>. A subsequent FA investigation involving QPR's acquisition of <a href="Alejandro%20Faurl%C3%ADn">Alejandro Faurlín</a> threatened to deduct points from the side and put their promotion into jeopardy. The investigation concluded on 7 May 2011, with QPR found to be at fault in two of the seven charges, and received a £875,000 fine. However, there were no points deducted by the FA, and QPR's promotion to the Premier League was secured.
In January 2012, club chairman <a href="Tony%20Fernandes">Tony Fernandes</a> appointed <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a> as team <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a> 36 hours after the previous incumbent <a href="Neil%20Warnock">Neil Warnock</a> was sacked. Following a tough start to his Loftus Road career and after a run of five straight home wins, Hughes and QPR escaped relegation despite <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.%203%E2%80%932%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">a dramatic 3–2 defeat</a> at <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> on the last day of the season.
On 23 November 2012, Mark Hughes was sacked after a poor start to the 2012–13 season, having amassed only four points in 12 games and with the club languishing at the bottom of the Premier League despite significant financial investment in new players in the 11 months of Hughes' tenure. A day later, <a href="Harry%20Redknapp">Harry Redknapp</a> was confirmed as the new manager. On 28 April 2013, in a 0–0 draw against fellow relegation rivals <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>, and with three games of the season to play, QPR were relegated from the Premier League down to the Championship after two seasons in the top flight.
During the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.%20season">2013–14 season</a>, QPR finished fourth in the Championship, and qualified for the play-offs where they defeated <a href="Wigan%20Athletic">Wigan Athletic</a> in the semi-finals. In the <a href="2014%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20final">final</a> against favourites <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> on 24 May 2014, QPR won 1–0 with a goal scored by <a href="Bobby%20Zamora">Bobby Zamora</a> in the 90th minute to return to the Premier League.
Following promotion to the Premier League, QPR endured a difficult <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 campaign</a>. Harry Redknapp resigned in February after poor results and mutual frustration with the board. He was replaced by <a href="Chris%20Ramsey%20%28footballer%29">Chris Ramsey</a>. The club finished the season in last place, amassing only 30 points, and were relegated back to the Championship after only one season. After a poor start to the following season, Ramsey was sacked in November 2015 and former manager Neil Warnock returned in interim charge. On 4 December 2015, <a href="Jimmy%20Floyd%20Hasselbaink">Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink</a> was appointed the club's new manager on a rolling contract. Hasselbaink was sacked on 5 November 2016, just 11 months after being in charge. Then six days later QPR reappointed Ian Holloway who was in charge 10 years previously. Holloway left the club at the end of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a>.
On 17 May 2018, QPR appointed former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> manager <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a> as manager. Despite a promising first half of the season in which the team sat as high as eighth by Christmas, results quickly tailed off following the turn of the year and McClaren was sacked in April 2019 after a 2–1 loss to Bolton.
On 8 May 2019, <a href="Mark%20Warburton">Mark Warburton</a> was appointed as McClaren's successor on a two-year deal. He signed a new contract ahead of the 2021–22 season. The club challenged for promotion in each of Warburton's three seasons in charge however failed to make the play-offs in any of these seasons. Warburton's contract was not renewed after the 2021–22 season in which a disappointing end to the season saw Rangers drop out of the play-offs where they had spent the majority of the season and finishing 11th.
Ahead of the 2022–23 season, former <a href="Aston%20Villa">Aston Villa</a> assistant manager and <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> first-team coach <a href="Michael%20Beale%20%28football%20coach%29">Michael Beale</a> was appointed as manager on a three-year deal on 1 June 2022. A fortnight after pledging his loyalty to the club Beale was approached by Scottish club Rangers who appointed him manager in November 2022. On 11 December 2022, former <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> manager and <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> assistant <a href="Neil%20Critchley">Neil Critchley</a> was named QPR manager after signing a 3-and-a-half-year deal. However, after a dismal run of form and dropping to 20th in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>, <a href="Neil%20Critchley">Neil Critchley</a> was sacked after just 46 days in charge, leaving with the lowest win percentage of any manager in their history, winning one match from twelve. He was replaced by former player <a href="Gareth%20Ainsworth">Gareth Ainsworth</a>, signing from <a href="Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wycombe Wanderers</a>.
After a poor start to the 2023–24 season, Gareth Ainsworth was sacked with the club in 23rd-place in the Championship, before being replaced by <a href="Mart%C3%AD%20Cifuentes">Martí Cifuentes</a>. 
Grounds.
Queens Park Rangers have led a somewhat nomadic existence in their history. The several grounds used prior to 1886 are unknown but were probably in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%2C%20London">Queens Park</a> area of London (the first being "The Queens Park" itself). Thereafter, the club played at 15 different locations in west London and north-west London, but since joining <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> in 1920, they have only played at two grounds: <a href="Loftus%20Road">Loftus Road</a> ( Formally known as Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium ) and <a href="White%20City%20Stadium">White City Stadium</a>.
There were plans to build a new 40,000-seater stadium called New Queens Park; however, plans have been shelved with the club looking to build a stadium on the site of the <a href="Linford%20Christie%20Stadium">Linford Christie Stadium</a> with 30,000 seats. The club have argued this would bring a huge financial boost to the local area, but their plans were met with some initial scepticism by <a href="Hammersmith%20and%20Fulham%20London%20Borough%20Council%20election%2C%202006">Hammersmith & Fulham Council.</a>
QPR have also been involved in a long-running legal battle to build a training ground at <a href="Warren%20Farm%2C%20Southall">Warren Farm</a> in <a href="Southall">Southall</a>. In November 2018, <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Supreme Court</a> judges rejected the final appeal from local objectors against the proposals, paving the way for the redevelopment of the site to begin. However the club formally abandoned plans for a training ground at Warren Farm on 6 May 2020 replacing it with a plan to develop the site into a community sports centre as the club signed a non-disclosure agreement with an unknown party regarding the freehold of another site. It was announced on 6 July that the club formally secured the freehold of the Heston Sports Ground from Imperial College, with the intention of developing the site into a training ground for the club, with discussions ongoing between the club and Hounslow Council.
On 31 March 2021, the club obtained planning permission for the redevelopment of Heston Sports Ground into a state of the art training ground, subject to a referral to the Secretary of State. The club received formal support from the Secretary of State on 27 September 2021 along with final planning permission from Hounslow Council being granted, with formal construction beginning on 1 October 2021. The Club aims to move into the £20m facility, (with £6.75m being raised through a bond scheme), by the start of the 2022–23 season, with the final competition date being the 2023–24 season.
In June 2019, the club gifted the stadium naming rights to The Kiyan Prince Foundation, a local charity set up by the father of <a href="Kiyan%20Prince">Kiyan Prince</a>. Prince was a former QPR youth player who was fatally stabbed in 2006. On 25 May 2022, the club announced that the stadium name would revert to Loftus Road ahead of the 2022–23 season.
Supporters and rivalries.
QPR have a modest but loyal fanbase who come from across west London and the home counties. The club have supporters clubs across the world, including the Republic of Ireland, the USA, Australia, Norway, and Sierra Leone. The club's longest running fanzine is "A Kick Up The R's", which has been published every month since August 1987 and is sold at both home and away matches.
QPR have long-standing rivalries with several other clubs due to the club's location in West London. The most notable of these is the West London derby against <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. Other rivalries include <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>,<a href="Cardiff%20City">Cardiff City</a>, <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>, <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> and <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton</a>.
The most vocal QPR fans at home games can be found in the Q, P and R Blocks where fans often choose to stand and create the chants which the rest of the support in the Loft and the Stanley Bowles Stand follow.
Songs and chants.
When the club won the League Cup final in 1967, the club released the single "QPR – The Greatest" about the famous win, which featured the vocals of Rangers winger <a href="Mark%20Lazarus">Mark Lazarus</a>.
As the team come on the pitch at Loftus Road and when the team score the song <a href="Papa%27s%20Got%20a%20Brand%20New%20Pigbag">Papa's Got a Brand New Pigbag</a> by post-punk band <a href="Pigbag">Pigbag</a> is played with the fans shouting "HOOPS" after the fifth trumpet toot.
At matches Rangers fans sing chants such as "Come On You Rs", "We are the pride of West London, The Blue & The White", "Captain Jack" and "We Are the Rangers Boys".

Club management.
Managerial history.
"The last ten permanent managers of QPR:"
Ownership and finances.
British music, media and sport entrepreneur <a href="Chris%20Wright%20%28music%20industry%20executive%29">Chris Wright</a> bought QPR in 1996, eventually relinquishing his majority shareholding in 2001 having ploughed £20 million into Loftus Road over the previous five years; the club struggled financially and went into administration that same year. Following lengthy negotiations in December 2004, Wright agreed to sell his remaining 15% stake; 50% of the money paid to him was given back to QPR, which was significant amount of cash to the club.
After a number of years of financial difficulties which included a period in financial administration, QPR was bought by <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> tycoons and multi-millionaires <a href="Bernie%20Ecclestone">Bernie Ecclestone</a> and <a href="Flavio%20Briatore">Flavio Briatore</a> in a £14 million takeover in August 2007. In spending £690,000 to acquire a 69% majority stake in the club from a Monaco-based consortium led by Italian football agent, Antonio Caliendo, Ecclestone spent £150,000 on his 15%, while Briatore bought 54% for £540,000 through a British Virgin Islands registered company, Sarita Capital. In addition, Briatore and Ecclestone were believed to have promised £5 million in convertible loan facilities to help buy players and have covered £13 million of debt, in a total commitment to the club of around £20 million. At the time of purchase, the remaining 31% of shareholders turned down the offer of 1p a share.
On 20 December 2007, it was announced that the family of billionaire <a href="Lakshmi%20Mittal">Lakshmi Mittal</a> had purchased a 20% shareholding in the club from Flavio Briatore. The purchase price of the 20% stake was just £200,000. As part of the investment Lakshmi Mittal's son-in-law <a href="Amit%20Bhatia">Amit Bhatia</a> took a place on the board of directors. While Gianni Paladini remained chairman of the football club, <a href="Alejandro%20Agag">Alejandro Agag</a>, as chairman of QPR Holdings (the parent company) was the de facto chairman, until he was replaced by Flavio Briatore in early February 2008. Agag moved into the role of managing director, supported by a deputy managing director, Ali Russell, who moved from <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Hearts</a> in the <a href="Scottish%20Premier%20League">Scottish Premier League</a>.
Despite QPR's perilous financial condition in 2007–08, the combined personal wealth of the club's new owners – which included the then world's eighth richest man, Lakshmi Mittal – sparked speculation that QPR would receive significant further investment from their new benefactors, drawing parallels with their wealthy West London neighbours <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>. However, no significant further funds were made available to the club other than those injected as part of the purchase of its share capital, and much of the subsequent player transfer activity involved loan acquisitions or free transfers. Indeed, it was reported in January 2008 that the investors had not discharged the £10 million loan from ABC Corporation – secured on the club's stadium – together with its £1 million annual interest burden—despite the club's prospective annual turnover of between £10 million and £15 million. Furthermore, around £2 million was still owed to former director and major shareholder, Antonio Caliendo, who waived £4.5 million of loans when Briatore and Ecclestone bought the club. It was expected that the ABC loan would be discharged in June 2008 on its maturity and that the debt owed to Caliendo would be paid off "in early 2008" in line with a funding strategy which Ecclestone publicly stated would not result in the wealthy owners simply bankrolling the club. In fact, the ABC loan was discharged on or around 31 July 2008.
Mittal's investment is thought to be primarily motivated by his son-in-law's interests and it was assumed that Mittal himself would remain a silent investor while Briatore, Ecclestone and Bhatia worked together to implement the strategy of slowly building the club up ahead of a push for promotion to the Premier League in 2009. The new owners also pledged to refurbish Loftus Road and use their experience in <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> to increase sponsorship revenues. On 25 March 2008, QPR confirmed that, from the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 season</a> and for five seasons, their kits would be supplied by <a href="Lotto%20Sport%20Italia">Lotto Sport Italia</a> as part of a number of new partnerships formed by Flavio Briatore. The investment potential of the club's new backers resulted in a number of wildly speculative storylines in the football press throughout the 2007–08 season, including rumoured signings of former <a href="FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">World Player of the Year winners</a> <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Figo">Luís Figo</a> and <a href="Zinedine%20Zidane">Zinedine Zidane</a>, the latter as a possible manager.
In May 2008, billionaire <a href="Vijay%20Mallya">Vijay Mallya</a> was linked with buying into the club, as part of the Ecclestone, Briatore and Mittal consortium. Following the termination of the club's sponsorship deals with Car Giant, <a href="Le%20Coq%20Sportif">Le Coq Sportif</a> and <a href="Sellotape">Sellotape</a> at the end of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>, in early July 2008 it was expected to be announced that <a href="Gulf%20Air">Gulf Air</a> would be the new shirt sponsors for three years. Further sponsorship packages were also announced, including <a href="Abbey%20National">Abbey Financial Services</a> and <a href="Lotto%20Sport%20Italia">Lotto Sport Italia</a>. On 12 September 2011, <a href="Malaysia%20Airlines">Malaysia Airlines</a> and <a href="AirAsia">AirAsia</a> announced sponsorship of QPR's shirts for the two seasons, with the sponsorship costing some £6.2 million.
Flavio Briatore's future as QPR chairman came into question in September 2009 after he left the <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault F1</a> team in the midst of <a href="Renault%20Formula%20One%20crash%20controversy">race fixing allegations</a>. The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various questions before commenting further. Meanwhile, the club continued to make losses (£18.8m in 2008–09 and £13.7m 2009–10). Briatore sold his 62% share to Ecclestone in December 2010, with the Italian possibly retaining a right of first refusal should Ecclestone sell, and initially stepped back from the day-to-day running of the business in favour of Amit Bhatia and Ishan Saksena, the company chairman and managing director respectively. However, his involvement gradually returned, and conflicts between Briatore on the one hand and Bhatia and Saksena on the other resulted in both Bhatia and Saksena leaving QPR in May 2011.
On 18 August 2011, Malaysian businessman <a href="Tony%20Fernandes">Tony Fernandes</a> was unveiled as the majority shareholder after having bought out Ecclestone's 66 per cent stake in the club for a rumoured fee of around £35 million, while the Mittal Family retained their 33% stake. Amit Bhatia was restored to his position as vice-chairman. Phillip Beard was announced as the new chief executive of the club and Gianni Paladini removed as club chairman. Briatore and Ecclestone were no longer involved with the club, with no board representation or other financial ties. Bhatia also explained in the takeover announcement that the loan, representing the refinanced ABC Corporation debt secured using the stadium as collateral, had now been "bought off" by the new regime – that is, refinanced by new debt. It is thought that the current debt is represented by a <a href="shareholder%20loan">shareholder loan</a> to the club and is non-interest-bearing. Despite the club's fortunes in attracting investors, it continues to be mired in controversy from previous ownership regimes and has been subject to proceedings from former investors <a href="Carlos%20Dunga">Carlos Dunga</a> and Antonio Caliendo.
On 15 August 2018, Bhatia took over as chairman of the club. On 10 July 2023, Fernandes announced that he is disposing all of his shares in the club to focus on rebuilding his airline business.

Watford F.C.

Watford Football Club is an English professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Watford">Watford</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. They play in the <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a>, the second tier of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>.
The team played at several grounds in their early history, including what is now West Herts Sports Club, before moving to <a href="Vicarage%20Road">Vicarage Road</a> in 1922. They have a <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.%E2%80%93Watford%20F.C.%20rivalry">long-standing rivalry</a> with nearby club <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>.
<a href="Graham%20Taylor">Graham Taylor</a>'s tenure as manager at the club between 1977 and 1987 saw Watford rise from the fourth tier to the first. The team finished second in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">1982–83</a>, competed in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> in <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20UEFA%20Cup">1983–84</a>, and reached the <a href="1984%20FA%20Cup%20final">1984 FA Cup final</a>. Watford declined between 1987 and 1997, before Taylor returned as manager, leading the team to successive <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotions</a> from the renamed <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> for one season in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000</a>. The club played again in the highest tier in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">2006–07</a> under <a href="Aidy%20Boothroyd">Aidy Boothroyd</a>'s management, and then again from 2015 to 2020, reaching the <a href="2019%20FA%20Cup%20final">2019 FA Cup final</a>, their second FA Cup final, but losing to a record-equalling 6–0 score line. In April 2021, Watford were promoted back into the Premier League having spent just one season in the Championship, but were relegated back to the Championship in May 2022.
History.
Early years.
The origins of the club can be traced back to 1881 when Watford Rovers were formed by Henry Grover, who went on to play for the club as a <a href="full-back%20%28football%29">full back</a>. Rovers, originally composed entirely of <a href="amateur%20football">amateur players</a>, held home games at several locations in the <a href="Watford">town of Watford</a>. The team first competed in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in the <a href="1886%E2%80%9387%20FA%20Cup">1886–87 season</a>, and in 1889 Watford won the <a href="Herts%20Senior%20Cup">County Cup</a> for the first time. The team became the football section of "West Hertfordshire Club and Ground" in 1891, and consequently moved to a ground on <a href="Cassio%20Road">Cassio Road</a>. In 1893 Watford Rovers changed their name to "West Herts" and in 1896 they joined the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern Football League</a>. West Herts fortunes slumped at the start of the 1897–98 season and attendances were less than 200. They took the bold step of turning professional and their fortunes revived. Watford St. Mary's were runners up in the Hertfordshire Senior Cup of 1894–95 and attracted crowds of 400 to 500 even when West Herts were at home. The two clubs talked of an amalgamation, which ultimately occurred on 15 April 1898. This was reported by the "<a href="Watford%20Observer">Watford Observer</a>" of 7 May 1898. It was agreed that the two clubs should complete their remaining fixtures for the season. The new club was named Watford Football Club.
Following <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a> to the Southern League Second Division in 1903, Watford appointed its first manager – former England international and First Division top scorer <a href="John%20Goodall">John Goodall</a>. He led Watford to promotion, and kept the team in the division until his departure in 1910. Despite financial constraints, Watford won the Southern League title in the <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">1914–15 season</a> under his successor, <a href="Harry%20Kent%20%28footballer%29">Harry Kent</a>. Watford held the title for five years following the suspension of the Southern League during the First World War – after finishing the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">1919–20 season</a> runners-up on <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a>, the club resigned from the Southern League to join the new <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Football League Third Division</a>.
From <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20in%20English%20football">1921–22</a>, the third tier of <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> consisted of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> and also battling to hold on to their league status. There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams in each of the two divisions had to apply for re-election to the league. Watford finished outside the top six league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kent's departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20in%20English%20football">1926–27</a>, but were unanimously re-elected to the league after a ballot of clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League. By contrast, under <a href="Neil%20McBain">Neil McBain</a> and subsequently <a href="Bill%20Findlay%20%28footballer%29">Bill Findlay</a>, the team recorded five consecutive top six finishes between <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20in%20English%20football">1934–35</a> and <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20in%20English%20football">1938–39</a>, and won the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South%20Cup">Football League Third Division South Cup</a> in 1937. The Football League was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War.
Post-war era.
Football resumed in 1946, with Watford still in the Third Division South. A 23rd-placed finish in <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20in%20English%20football">1950–51</a> meant that the club had to apply for re-election to the league once more, but again teams in the First and Second Divisions unanimously voted for Watford to stay in the league. McBain returned in 1956, and the team remained in the division until 1958; the league was restructured into four national divisions for the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a> season, and Watford were placed in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>. <a href="Ron%20Burgess%20%28footballer%29">Ron Burgess</a> replaced McBain during that season, and in the following campaign Burgess presided over Watford's first Football League promotion. This team included Fourth Division top scorer <a href="Cliff%20Holton">Cliff Holton</a>, who scored a club record 42 league goals in the season. Holton was sold to Northampton the following year after another 34 goals, to the anger of supporters. Burgess was succeeded by <a href="Bill%20McGarry%20%28footballer%29">Bill McGarry</a>, who bought new players such as <a href="Charlie%20Livesey">Charlie Livesey</a> and <a href="Ron%20Saunders">Ron Saunders</a>, and in his only season at the club led the club to what was at the time its highest ever league position: third in the Third Division. Eighteen-year-old Northern Irish goalkeeper <a href="Pat%20Jennings">Pat Jennings</a> also featured under McGarry, and made his international debut despite being a Third Division player.
McGarry joined <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich</a> in 1964, and was replaced by player-manager <a href="Ken%20Furphy">Ken Furphy</a>, from <a href="Workington%20A.F.C.">Workington</a> Furphy rebuilt the team around players such as <a href="Keith%20Eddy">Keith Eddy</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Bond%20%28footballer%29">Dennis Bond</a>, but after holding <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> to a draw in the FA Cup and narrowly failing to win promotion in <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20in%20English%20football">1966–67</a>, Bond was sold to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> for <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>30,000, Watford's record transfer receipt at the time. Furphy's rebuilding came to fruition in 1969 with the signing of <a href="Barry%20Endean">Barry Endean</a>, whose arrival marked the start of an unbeaten run after Christmas. Watford secured the Third Division title in April, at home to <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a>. A year later Watford reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time, defeating <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> teams <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> and Liverpool along the way. Hampered by a lack of funds, however, Furphy eventually joined <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, to be succeeded by <a href="George%20Kirby%20%28footballer%29">George Kirby</a>. Forced to sell players to survive, Watford fell back into the Third Division in 1972. The team continued to struggle in the third tier, and despite a managerial change, Watford were relegated again in 1975.
Elton John era.
Lifelong Watford supporter <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> became club chairman in 1976. The singer declared an ambition to take the team into the First Division, and sacked Kirby's successor <a href="Mike%20Keen">Mike Keen</a> in April 1977. When <a href="Graham%20Taylor">Graham Taylor</a> was named as Keen's successor, the club was still in the Fourth Division. Taylor achieved promotion in his <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">first season</a>; Watford won the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> title, recording the most wins, fewest defeats, most goals scored and fewest goals conceded of any side in the division. Promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> followed in <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20in%20English%20football">1978–79</a>, and <a href="Ross%20Jenkins%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201951%29">Ross Jenkins</a> finished the season as the league's top scorer with 29 goals. Watford consolidated with 18th and 9th-placed finishes over the following two seasons, and secured promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> for the first time in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20in%20English%20football">1981–82</a>, finishing second behind <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20and%20Watford%20F.C.%20rivalry">rivals</a> <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>.
Watford started the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">1982–83</a> season with four league wins from the opening five fixtures; in the space of seven years, the club had climbed from bottom place in the lowest division of The Football League to top position in the highest division. Watford were unable to maintain a title challenge, but eventually finished the season second behind Liverpool, which ensured <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> qualification for the following season. <a href="Luther%20Blissett">Luther Blissett</a> finished the season as the <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">First Division top scorer</a>, before signing for Italian <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a> side <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> for £1 million at the end of the season. An <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> appearance followed in <a href="1984%20FA%20Cup%20Final">the 1984 fixture</a>, where they lost to <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. After guiding Watford to a ninth-place finish in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87</a>, Taylor left the club to manage <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>.
Following Taylor's departure, <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon</a> manager <a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a> was appointed as his replacement, and England <a href="winger%20%28football%29">winger</a> <a href="John%20Barnes">John Barnes</a> was sold to Liverpool. After 4 wins from his opening 23 league fixtures, Bassett was sacked in January 1988. Watford were bottom of the First Division at the time of his departure, and <a href="Steve%20Harrison%20%28footballer%29">Steve Harrison</a> could not prevent relegation at the end of the season. In <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89</a>, Harrison's Watford failed to return to the First Division, after defeat in the Second Division play-offs. The under-18 team won the <a href="FA%20Youth%20Cup">FA Youth Cup</a>, beating <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> 2–1 after extra time, with future <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England international</a> <a href="David%20James%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201970%29">David James</a> in goal for the Hornets. Harrison departed in 1990, and over the next few years, the closest Watford came to promotion was a seventh-placed finish in Division One in the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95 season</a>. However, in the following season – <a href="Glenn%20Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a>'s third as manager – Watford struggled. Despite the return of Graham Taylor as caretaker manager in February 1996, the club was relegated to Division Two.
Following the relegation, Taylor became director of football, with former Watford midfielder <a href="Kenny%20Jackett">Kenny Jackett</a> as manager. After a mid-table finish in Division Two in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1996–97</a>, Jackett was demoted to the position of assistant manager. Taylor returned as manager, and won the Second Division title in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a> – Watford's second league title under his management. A second successive promotion followed in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">1998–99</a>, thanks to a 2–0 <a href="1999%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20Final">play-off final</a> victory over <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. Watford's first <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">Premiership season</a> started with an early victory over Liverpool, but Watford's form soon faded, and the club were relegated after finishing bottom. Graham Taylor retired at the end of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">2000–01 season</a>, and was replaced by <a href="Gianluca%20Vialli">Gianluca Vialli</a>. Wage bills at the club rose by £4 million during Vialli's tenure, and the club finished 14th in the division in 2001–02. Vialli was sacked at the end of the season, following a dispute with the club's board over the wage bill. He was replaced by <a href="Ray%20Lewington">Ray Lewington</a>, who had joined the club the previous summer as Vialli's reserve team manager.
Financial struggles.
Watford's weak financial position was exposed in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">2002–03</a>, following the collapse of <a href="ITV%20Digital">ITV Digital</a>. The club was facing administration, but an agreement by players and staff to a 12% wage deferral helped the club's cash flow, and a run to the FA Cup semi-final generated vital revenue. Financial constraints saw a large number of players released that summer. After consolidating in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">2003–04</a>, <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">the following season</a> started well, with the club in the upper half of the <a href="EFL%20Championship">Championship</a> at the end of September. Poor form, however, saw the club drop towards the relegation zone. Despite reaching the semi-final of the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>, Watford's league form did not improve, and Lewington was sacked in March 2005. His successor, <a href="Aidy%20Boothroyd">Aidy Boothroyd</a>, led the club to Championship survival.
Return to the Premier League.
Watford finished third in the league in Boothroyd's <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">first full season</a>, and defeated <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> 3–0 in the <a href="2006%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">play-off final</a> to gain promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. But the team did not record a Premier League win until November, and <a href="Ashley%20Young">Ashley Young</a> was sold to Aston Villa for a club record fee of £9.65 million in January 2007. Watford finished bottom after only winning five league games, but did reach the semi-finals of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. Boothroyd continued as manager, and spent heavily on players, including a then-club record £3.25 million for <a href="Nathan%20Ellington">Nathan Ellington</a>. Watford led the Championship by several points early in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">2007–08</a>, but only finished sixth; Boothroyd's team were defeated 6–1 on aggregate by <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> in the play-off semi-finals. Boothroyd left the club by mutual consent three months into the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 season</a>, with Watford 21st in the Championship table.
Under Boothroyd's successor, <a href="Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a>, Watford finished 13th. Rodgers left to manage <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> at the end of the season; <a href="Malky%20Mackay">Malky Mackay</a>, who had previously served as caretaker manager, was his replacement. Amid the departures of several key players during Mackay's tenure, including <a href="Tommy%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201980%29">Tommy Smith</a> and <a href="Jay%20DeMerit">Jay DeMerit</a>, and the club coming close to <a href="Administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a>, Watford finished 16th in <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">2009–10</a> and 14th the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">following season</a>. Mackay left to manage <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> in June 2011 and was replaced by <a href="Sean%20Dyche">Sean Dyche</a>. Despite presiding over Watford's highest league position in four years by finishing 11th, Dyche was dismissed as Watford manager in July 2012.
Pozzo family era.
In June 2012, <a href="Laurence%20Bassini">Laurence Bassini</a> completed the sale of the club to the Pozzo family (<a href="Gino%20Pozzo">Gino Pozzo</a> and his father). Following Dyche's sacking, the new owners brought in former <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> international <a href="Gianfranco%20Zola">Gianfranco Zola</a> to take charge. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">2012–13 season</a> Watford finished third in the Championship, and reached the play-off final where they were defeated in the final by <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> 1–0 via an extra-time penalty by <a href="Kevin%20Phillips%20%28footballer%29">Kevin Phillips</a>. The following season, <a href="Giuseppe%20Sannino">Giuseppe Sannino</a> replaced Zola, as their new manager and the team finished the season in 13th place. Sannino resigned at the start of the 2014–15 season and was replaced by <a href="%C3%93scar%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Junyent">Óscar García</a>, who left shortly afterwards for "health reasons."
<a href="Billy%20McKinlay">Billy McKinlay</a> replaced him but, despite winning 4 points out of a possible 6 under his stewardship, after just eight days he too was replaced, by <a href="Slavi%C5%A1a%20Jokanovi%C4%87">Slaviša Jokanović</a>. With Jokanović managing the team, Watford finished second in the Championship, after being edged out on the final day by champions AFC Bournemouth, and were promoted.
Watford did not renew Jokanović's contract and he was replaced by the Spaniard <a href="Quique%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Flores">Quique Sánchez Flores</a> ahead of the 2015–16 season. Under Sánchez Flores Watford finished 13th in the Premier League, and reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, ending Arsenal's bid to win the competition for three successive times, but were beaten 2–1 by <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>. Near the end of the season, in May 2016, Sánchez Flores and the club enacted a break clause in his contract, and he was replaced by Italian coach <a href="Walter%20Mazzarri">Walter Mazzarri</a> who signed a three-year contract. At the end of the next season, in May 2017, Watford finished 17th and Mazzari resigned, replaced by <a href="Marco%20Silva">Marco Silva</a>. The new coach was sacked after approximately six months, following interest from Everton, in January 2018, and the club hired <a href="Javi%20Gracia">Javi Gracia</a>. In April 2019 Watford came back from 2–0 down to beat <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> to reach the <a href="2019%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup final</a> for the second time in their history, with <a href="Gerard%20Deulofeu">Gerard Deulofeu</a> scoring twice and <a href="Troy%20Deeney">Troy Deeney</a> scoring a penalty in the 94th minute to take it to extra time. They met <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in the <a href="2019%20FA%20Cup%20final">final</a> and were defeated 6–0, a joint record margin of victory for an FA Cup Final. In the league Watford finished 11th, with 50 points, both club records for the Premier League era.
After four games of being in charge in the 2019–20 season, Gracia was sacked due to poor form in the league. 30 minutes after he was sacked, former manager Quique Sánchez Flores was again appointed. He survived only until 1 December 2019 after getting only one win since his appointment in September. A caretaker manager was appointed for one game before <a href="Nigel%20Pearson">Nigel Pearson</a> came into management. Watford ended Liverpool's unbeaten run of 44 top-flight games in February 2020, but Pearson was sacked 2 games before the end of the season, and the club were relegated, finishing 19th out of 20. Watford finished the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20EFL%20Championship">2020–21 Championship season</a> in second place, gaining immediate promotion back to the Premier League, but again finished the following season 19th out of 20 and were relegated back to the Championship.
Club identity.
Watford's kit has changed considerably over the course of the club's history. The club's kit featured various combinations of red, green and yellow stripes, before a new colour scheme of black and white was adopted for the 1909–10 season. These colours were retained until the 1920s, when the club introduced an all-blue shirt. After a change of colours to gold shirts and black shorts for 1959–60, the team's nickname was changed to The Hornets, after a popular vote via the supporters club. These colours remained until 1976, when Watford's kits started featuring red, and the gold was changed to yellow. That colour scheme has continued into the 21st century.
Watford's initial nickname was "The Brewers", in reference to the <a href="Benskins%20Brewery">Benskins Brewery</a>, which owned the freehold of Vicarage Road. This nickname did not prove particularly popular, and upon the adoption of a blue-and-white colour scheme in the 1920s, the club became predominantly known as "The Blues". When Watford changed kit colours in 1959, supporters chose "The Hornets" as the team's new nickname, and the club later introduced a crest depicting a hornet. In 1974 the design was changed to depict Harry the Hornet, the club's mascot. The club's nickname remains, but in 1978 the hornet crest was replaced by a depiction of a <a href="Hart%20%28deer%29">hart</a> – a male red fallow deer– on a yellow and black background. A hart represents the town's location in the county of <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. Until <a href="Barnet%20F.C.">Barnet</a> and, later, Stevenage joined the Football League, Watford were Hertfordshire's only league club. Other nicknames have since been adopted, including "Yellow Army" and "The 'Orns".
Until April 2019, when Watford played at <a href="Vicarage%20Road">Vicarage Road</a> their players traditionally entered the pitch at the start of the game to the "<a href="Z-Cars">Z-Cars</a>" <a href="Theme%20from%20Z-Cars">theme tune</a>. However, in mid-April 2019 the team changed their entrance song to Elton John's "<a href="I%27m%20Still%20Standing">I'm Still Standing</a>". The club returned to Z Cars as the theme to welcome players to the pitch in August 2019 at the start of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Premier%20League">2019–20 Premier League</a> season, following fan pressure and petitions.
Stadium.
Watford Rovers played at several grounds in the late 19th century, including <a href="Cassiobury%20Park">Cassiobury Park</a>, Vicarage Meadow and Market Street, <a href="Watford">Watford</a>. In 1890, the team moved to a site on <a href="Cassio%20Road">Cassio Road</a>, and remained there for 32 years, before moving to Watford's current stadium at nearby <a href="Vicarage%20Road">Vicarage Road</a> in 1922. The new stadium was initially owned by <a href="Benskins%20Brewery">Benskins Brewery</a>; the club rented the ground until 2001, when it purchased the freehold outright. However, the club's financial situation worsened following the purchase, and in 2002 Watford sold the ground for £6 million in a deal which entitled Watford to buy the stadium back for £7 million in future. Watford took up this option in 2004 using a campaign backed and funded by the fans called "Lets buy back the Vic".
Vicarage Road is a four-sided ground with a capacity of 21,577. The East Stand, part of which was constructed in 1922, was closed to the general public in 2008 for health and safety reasons, although it still hosted the dressing rooms and the matchday press area. In November 2013, the East Stand was demolished and in its place a new steel-framed, 3,500-seater stand was constructed. The stand opened fully on Boxing Day 2014 and was named The Elton John Stand after the club's longstanding chairman. The Graham Taylor Stand (previously the Rous Stand), built in 1986, has two tiers and runs the length of the pitch, with the upper section containing the club's corporate hospitality. At either end of the pitch, The Vicarage Road Stand is split between the club's family section and away supporters, while the Rookery Stand is for home supporters only. Both stands were built in the 1990s, financed by proceeds from player sales. In the summer of 2015, The Elton John Stand was revamped in order to accommodate an extra 700 seats. This number was revised a day later to around 1,000 extra seats following the announcement of an expansion in the north-east corner.
Between 1997 and early 2013, Watford shared Vicarage Road with <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> side <a href="Saracens%20F.C.">Saracens F.C.</a> The stadium has hosted matches for the <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England under-21s</a>, and senior international football between overseas teams. Elton John has also used Vicarage Road as a venue for concerts: He first played at the stadium in 1974 and returned in 2005 and 2010 to stage fundraising concerts for the club. Former events include horse and carriage shows and <a href="greyhound%20racing">greyhound racing</a>.
The <a href="Watford%20Training%20Ground">Watford Training Ground</a> is located on the <a href="University%20College%20London%20Union">University College London Union</a> (UCLU) Shenley Sports grounds in <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>.
Luton rivalry.
Watford fans maintain a rivalry with those of <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>. The two sides met regularly in the Southern League between 1900 and 1920, and continued to do so in The Football League until 1937, when Luton gained promotion from Division Three South. Luton remained in a higher division than Watford until 1963.
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Watford and Luton met sporadically. Despite this, the rivalry grew in significance, particularly following an ill-tempered match between the sides in 1969, in which three players were sent off. Both sides won promotion to the First Division in the 1981–82 season, with Luton taking the championship ahead of Watford. They were also relegated together from the new Division 1 in 1995–96, with Watford finishing 23rd ahead of bottom-placed Luton. Watford's promotion from Division 2 in 1997–98 meant that the two sides did not meet again until Luton won promotion to the Championship for the 2005–06 season. The only meeting between those seasons – a League Cup tie in the 2002–03 season – was marred by violence inside Vicarage Road.
On 2 January 2006, Watford won 2–1 at Kenilworth Road in the Championship, followed by a 1–1 draw between the sides, on 9 April 2006, a point that secured Watford's place in the 2006 Championship play-offs, from which they eventually won promotion to the Premier League for the second time, beating Leeds United, 3–0, at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>.
Over a fourteen-season span, Watford have played in a higher division than Luton between <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07</a> and the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">2019–20</a> season, with Luton dropping out of the football league altogether for six seasons between <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10</a> and <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">2014–15</a>.
The rivalry between the two clubs resumed in the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">2020–21</a> season. On 26 September 2020, Watford won the first league match of the season between the two clubs, 1–0, at Vicarage Road. On 17 April 2021 in the reverse fixture at Kenilworth Road, Luton won, 1–0, so the spoils for the season were shared. With Watford's promotion back to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> for season <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20in%20English%20football">2021–22</a>, the rivalry did not commence that year; although it is set to resume for the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20in%20English%20football">2022–23</a> season after Watford's immediate relegation from the Premier League, whilst Luton remained in the Championship.
The head-to-head record between the clubs, in competitions which currently exist, stands at Luton 39 wins, Watford 27 wins, with 23 draws. Watford have remained the higher ranked team at the end of every season since 1997 (and for 28 of the last 29 seasons, with only 1996–97 seeing Luton finish higher in the league than Watford) whilst Luton still have many more years in a higher league throughout both teams history.

Managers.
Watford's team was selected by committee until 1903, when former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> international <a href="John%20Goodall">John Goodall</a> was appointed <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a>. The impact was immediate, as Watford secured promotion to the Southern League First Division in 1903–04. Goodall retired as a player in 1907, and left the club in 1910. He was replaced by his former captain, <a href="Harry%20Kent%20%28footballer%29">Harry Kent</a>, who become known for his financial management of the club; under Kent, Watford frequently made a profit in the transfer market. Kent led the club to the Southern League title in <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">1914–15</a>, and missed out on a second title in <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">1919–20</a> on <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a>, before resigning in 1926. His three immediate successors – <a href="Fred%20Pagnam">Fred Pagnam</a>, <a href="Neil%20McBain">Neil McBain</a> and <a href="Bill%20Findlay%20%28footballer%29">Bill Findlay</a> – all played for Watford before and during the early part of their managerial tenures. None were able to lead the team to promotion from the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a>, although Findlay did lead Watford to a <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South%20Cup">Third Division South Cup</a> win in 1937.
Up until Findlay's departure in 1947, Watford had been managed by five managers in 44 years, all of whom played for the team. By contrast, six men managed the club between 1947 and 1956, only two of whom were former Watford players. After a further three years under McBain between 1956 and 1959, Watford's following three managers presided over improved teams. <a href="Ron%20Burgess%20%28footballer%29">Ron Burgess</a> led Watford to promotion from the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> in 1959–60. <a href="Bill%20McGarry">Bill McGarry</a> was only in charge for one full season (1963–64), but Watford recorded a finish of third in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>, the club's highest Football League finish until that point. His successor <a href="Ken%20Furphy">Ken Furphy</a> matched that achievement in 1966–67, and led Watford to the Third Division title in 1969, before taking the club to its first <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-final in 1970. Following Furphy's departure in 1971, Watford entered a period of decline, experiencing relegation under subsequent managers <a href="George%20Kirby%20%28footballer%29">George Kirby</a> and <a href="Mike%20Keen">Mike Keen</a>.
Graham Taylor took charge of Watford in 1977. He led the club to promotion to the Third Division in 1978, the Second Division in 1979, and the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> for the first time in Watford's history in 1982. After a second-placed finish in the First Division in 1983, Watford competed in European competition for the first time in 1983–84, as well as reaching the <a href="1984%20FA%20Cup%20final">1984 FA Cup final</a>. Taylor left the club at the end of 1986–87. Under the six subsequent permanent managers (<a href="Dave%20Bassett">Dave Bassett</a>, <a href="Steve%20Harrison%20%28footballer%29">Steve Harrison</a>, <a href="Colin%20Lee">Colin Lee</a>, <a href="Steve%20Perryman">Steve Perryman</a>, <a href="Glenn%20Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a> and <a href="Kenny%20Jackett">Kenny Jackett</a>), Watford slid from 9th in the top tier in 1987, to 13th in the third tier in 1997. Taylor returned as manager for the start of the 1997–98 season. He led the club to consecutive promotions, but could not prevent relegation from the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Watford%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000</a>. Since Taylor's retirement in 2001, Watford have had twelve managers. Of these, <a href="Aidy%20Boothroyd">Aidy Boothroyd</a> took Watford back to the Premier League in 2006, but Watford were relegated in 2007, and Boothroyd departed in 2008.
Following Watford's takeover by the Pozzo family, <a href="Gianfranco%20Zola">Gianfranco Zola</a> was appointed head coach, replacing former centre back <a href="Sean%20Dyche">Sean Dyche</a> in July 2012. Zola took Watford to third position in the Championship in 2012–13 but resigned on 16 December 2013. He was replaced by fellow Italian <a href="Giuseppe%20Sannino">Beppe Sannino</a> in December 2013. Sannino guided the team to a final league position of 13th.
Despite winning four of the first five league matches of the 2014–15 season, and with Watford sitting in 2nd place, Sannino's position had become the subject of much speculation following rumours of dressing-room unrest and some players taking a dislike to his style of management. Sannino resigned from his position as head coach on 31 August 2014 after just over eight months in charge. His final game in charge was a 4–2 win at home to <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> the day before.
Sannino's departure initiated a bizarre sequence of events which led to Watford having three further head coaches in little more than a month. On 2 September, Watford confirmed the appointment of former <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a> head coach <a href="%C3%93scar%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Junyent">Óscar García</a> as the successor to Sannino, beating off competition from fellow <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a> side <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C">Leeds United</a> for his services. García, however, resigned from his position on 29 September 2014 for health reasons, having been admitted to hospital with chest pains a couple of weeks prior. <a href="Billy%20McKinlay">Billy McKinlay</a>, who had only been appointed first team coach on 26 September 2014, was appointed as his immediate successor on the same day – his first position in management. A week later, McKinlay was released by mutual consent and former <a href="FK%20Partizan">Partizan</a> coach <a href="Slavi%C5%A1a%20Jokanovi%C4%87">Slaviša Jokanović</a> appointed in his place, apparently because the club favoured a head coach with greater experience.
On 4 June 2015, <a href="Quique%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Flores">Quique Sánchez Flores</a> was announced as the new head coach as the replacement to Jokanović, who had failed to agree contract terms. Despite going on to lead the newly promoted Watford to a comfortable mid-table position in the Premier League and the semi-final of the FA Cup, it was announced on 13 May 2016 that Sánchez Flores would be leaving the club at the end of the season.
Following Sánchez Flores's departure, Walter Mazzarri was announced as Watford's head coach starting on 1 July 2016.
Mazzari's tenure as manager was terminated at the end of the season.
On 27 May 2017 <a href="Marco%20Silva">Marco Silva</a> was appointed head coach.
On 21 January 2018, <a href="Javi%20Gracia">Javi Gracia</a> was appointed as head coach following Silva's departure. Gracia has been met with widespread praise since his appointment after a successful 2018–19 Premier League campaign which saw Watford finish with their highest points tally ever in English Premier League football.
Since around 2019, the club have gained notoriety for an excessive number of managerial sackings and a lack of giving managers time, instead sacking them very quickly after a poor run of form. After a disappointing start to the 2019–20 season, Javi Gracia was sacked and replaced by previous manager Quique Sánchez Flores. Then Quique Sánchez Flores was fired again after a 2–1 loss to Southampton on 1 December. On 6 December 2019, <a href="Nigel%20Pearson">Nigel Pearson</a> agreed to take manager's job, with Craig Shakespeare as his assistant, on a short-term contract to the end of the season. He was sacked on 19 July 2020 with two games to go with Hayden Mullins appointed as interim coach until the end of the season.
In the 2020–21 season, there were two more coaches, beginning with <a href="Vladimir%20Ivic">Vladimir Ivic</a>, and followed by <a href="Xisco%20Munoz">Xisco Munoz</a>, who ultimately steered Watford towards promotion to the Premier League. Xisco continued to coach the team for the 2021–22 Premier League campaign until October 2021, and was subsequently followed by <a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a> from October 2021 to January 2022. Former England manager <a href="Roy%20Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a> took hold of the reigns from February 2022 until the season's end, where Watford finished in 19th place and were relegated from the Premier League. 
<a href="Rob%20Edwards%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201982%29">Rob Edwards</a> was announced as the new manager for the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20EFL%20Championship">2022–23</a> season, but was released by the club in September 2022 after 11 games in charge. Rob Edwards subsequently has gone on to have considerable success at <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.%E2%80%93Watford%20F.C.%20rivalry">rivals</a> <a href="Luton%20Town">Luton Town</a>. <a href="Slaven%20Bili%C4%87">Slaven Bilić</a> was announced as his replacement on an 18-month contract. Bilic was subsequently sacked on 7 March 2023 and replaced by <a href="Chris%20Wilder">Chris Wilder</a> on a short-term contract until the end of the season, making it the third time in four seasons the club has had three head coaches in one season. On the 10 May 2023, French coach <a href="Val%C3%A9rien%20Isma%C3%ABl">Valérien Ismaël</a> was appointed head coach ahead of the 2023-24 Championship season.

Records.
Striker <a href="Luther%20Blissett">Luther Blissett</a> holds the record for Watford appearances, having played 503 matches in all competitions between 1976 and 1992, and his 415 appearances in <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> during the same period is also a club record. Blissett holds the corresponding goalscoring records, with 186 career Watford goals, 148 of which were in the league. The records for the most league goals in a season is held by <a href="Cliff%20Holton">Cliff Holton</a>, having scored 42 goals in the 1959–60 season. The highest number of goals scored by a player in a single game at a professional level is the six registered by Harry Barton against <a href="Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wycombe Wanderers</a> in September 1903.
Watford's biggest ever competitive win came in 1900, when the team defeated <a href="Maidenhead%20F.C.">Maidenhead</a> 11–0 in the Southern League Second Division. The team's biggest Football League winning margin is 8–0; this first occurred in a Third Division South match against <a href="Newport%20County%20A.F.C.">Newport County</a> in 1924, and was repeated in a First Division match against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> in 1982. Both of these matches were at home – Watford have won an away league match by five goals on six occasions, most recently in the 6–1 win against Leeds United at <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a> in 2012. The most goals scored in a Football League game involving Watford is 11, in Watford's 7–4 victories against <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a>, <a href="Torquay%20United%20F.C.">Torquay United</a> and <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> in 1934, 1937 and 2003 respectively. The club's highest home attendance is 34,099, for a fourth round FA Cup match against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> on 3 February 1969. The record home league attendance is 27,968 against <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> in August of the same year. Watford's home capacity has since been reduced due to all-seater requirements; it currently stands at 21,577.

Everton F.C.

Everton Football Club () is an English professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> that competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the top tier of <a href="Football%20in%20England">English football</a>. The club was a founder member of the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1888, and has, as of August 2023, competed in the top division for a <a href="Football%20records%20and%20statistics%20in%20England%23Top-flight%20appearances">record 121 seasons</a>, having missed only <a href="List%20of%20Everton%20F.C.%20seasons">four top-flight seasons</a> (<a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20Football%20League">1930–31</a>, <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20Everton%20F.C.%20season">1951–52</a>, <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20Everton%20F.C.%20season">1952–53</a>, and <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Everton%20F.C.%20season">1953–54</a>). Everton is the club with the second-longest continuous presence in English top-flight football, and ranks third in the all-time points rankings. The club has won nine <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">league titles</a>, five <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, one <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> and nine <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">Charity Shields</a>.
Formed in 1878, Everton won their first League Championship during the <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20Everton%20F.C.%20season">1890–91 season</a>. After winning four more League championships and two FA Cups, the club experienced a post-<a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> lull until a revival in the 1960s. A period of sustained success came in the mid-1980s, when Everton won a further two League championships, one FA Cup, and the <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Winners' Cup</a>. The club's most recent major trophy was the <a href="1995%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1995 FA Cup</a>.
The <a href="Everton%20F.C.%20supporters">club's supporters</a> are colloquially known as "Evertonians" or "Blues". Everton's main rivals are <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, whose home stadium at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> is just under one mile away from Everton's home at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a>; the two clubs contest the <a href="Merseyside%20derby">Merseyside derby</a>. Everton have been based at Goodison Park since 1892, having moved from their original home at Anfield following a disagreement with the landowner over their rent. The club's home colours are royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks.
History.
Everton was founded as St. Domingo's FC in 1878 so that members of the congregation of St Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel in Breckfield Road North, <a href="Everton%2C%20Liverpool">Everton</a>, could play sport year round – <a href="cricket">cricket</a> was played in summer. The club's first game was a 1–0 victory over Everton Church Club. The club was renamed Everton in November 1879 after the local area, as people outside the congregation wished to participate.
The club was a founding member of the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1888–89 and won their first <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">League Championship</a> title in the <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20Football%20League">1890–91 season</a>. Everton won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time in 1906 and the League Championship again in <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Football%20League">1914–15</a>. The outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> in 1914 interrupted the football programme while Everton were reigning champions, which was something that would again occur in 1939.
It was not until 1927 that Everton's first sustained period of success began. In 1925 the club signed <a href="Dixie%20Dean">Dixie Dean</a> from <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers%20F.C.">Tranmere Rovers</a>. In <a href="1927%E2%80%9328%20Football%20League">1927–28</a>, Dean set the record for top-flight league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games, which is a record that still stands. He helped Everton win their third League Championship that season. However, Everton were relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> two years later during internal turmoil at the club. The club quickly rebounded and were promoted at the first attempt, while scoring a record number of goals in the Second Division. On return to the top flight in <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20Football%20League">1931–32</a>, Everton wasted no time in reaffirming their status and won a fourth League Championship at the first opportunity. Everton also won their second FA Cup in 1933 with a 3–0 win against <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in the final. The era ended in <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20Football%20League">1938–39</a> with a fifth League Championship.
The outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> again saw the suspension of league football, and when official competition resumed in 1946, the Everton team had been split up and paled in comparison to the pre-war team. Everton were relegated for the second time in <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20Football%20League">1950–51</a> and did not earn promotion until <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Football%20League">1953–54</a>, when they finished as the runner-up in their third season in the Second Division. The club has been a top-flight presence ever since.
Everton's second successful era started when <a href="Harry%20Catterick">Harry Catterick</a> was made manager in 1961. In <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Football%20League">1962–63</a>, his second season in charge, Everton won the League Championship. In 1966 the club won the FA Cup with a 3–2 win over <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>. Everton again reached the final in 1968, but this time were unable to overcome <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. Two seasons later in <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Football%20League">1969–70</a>, Everton won the League Championship, finishing nine points clear of nearest rivals <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>. During this period, Everton were the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitions – covering the seasons from 1961–62 to 1966–67.
However, the success did not last; the team finished fourteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons. Harry Catterick retired, but his successors failed to win any <a href="Trophy">silverware</a> for the remainder of the 1970s despite finishing fourth in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Football%20League">1974–75</a> under manager Billy Bingham, third in <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Football%20League">1977–78</a> and fourth the following season under manager <a href="Gordon%20Lee%20%28footballer%29">Gordon Lee</a>. Lee was sacked in 1981.
<a href="Howard%20Kendall">Howard Kendall</a> took over as manager and guided Everton to their most successful era. Domestically, Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and two League Championships in <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Football%20League">1984–85</a> and <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Football%20League">1986–87</a>. In Europe, the club won their first, and so far only, European trophy by securing the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> in <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20final">1985</a>. The European success came after first beating <a href="University%20College%20Dublin%20A.F.C.">University College Dublin</a>, <a href="FK%20Inter%20Bratislava">Inter Bratislava</a> and <a href="Fortuna%20Sittard">Fortuna Sittard</a>. Then, Everton defeated German giants <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 3–1 in the semi-finals, despite trailing at half time (in a match voted the greatest in Goodison Park history), and recorded the same scoreline over Austrian club <a href="SK%20Rapid%20Wien">Rapid Vienna</a> in the final. Having won both the League and Cup Winners' Cup in 1985, Everton came very close to winning a <a href="treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a>, but lost to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the FA Cup <a href="1985%20FA%20Cup%20final">final</a>. The following season, <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Football%20League">1985–86</a>, Everton was the runner-up to Liverpool in both the League and the <a href="1986%20FA%20Cup%20final">FA Cup</a>, but did recapture the League Championship in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Football%20League">1986–87</a>.
After the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a> and the subsequent ban of all English clubs from continental football, Everton lost the chance to compete for more European trophies. A large proportion of the title-winning side was broken up following the ban. Kendall himself moved to <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> after the 1987 title triumph and was succeeded by assistant <a href="Colin%20Harvey">Colin Harvey</a>. Harvey took Everton to the <a href="1989%20FA%20Cup%20final">1989 FA Cup final</a>, but lost 3–2 after extra time to Liverpool.
Everton was a founding member of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992, but struggled to find the right manager. Howard Kendall had returned in 1990, but could not repeat his previous success. His successor, <a href="Mike%20Walker%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Mike Walker</a>, was statistically the least successful Everton manager to date. When former Everton player <a href="Joe%20Royle">Joe Royle</a> took over in 1994, the club's form started to improve; his first game in charge was a 2–0 victory over derby rivals Liverpool. Royle dragged Everton clear of relegation and led the club to the FA Cup for the fifth time in their history by defeating Manchester United 1–0 in the <a href="1995%20FA%20Cup%20final">final</a>. The cup triumph was also Everton's passport to the Cup Winners' Cup, their first European campaign in the post-Heysel era. Progress under Royle continued in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20FA%20Premier%20League">1995–96</a> as the team climbed to sixth place in the Premiership. A fifteenth-place finish the following season saw Royle resign towards the end of the campaign, and he was temporarily replaced by club captain <a href="Dave%20Watson">Dave Watson</a>.
Howard Kendall was appointed Everton manager for the third time in 1997, but the appointment proved unsuccessful as Everton finished seventeenth in the Premiership. The club only avoided relegation due to their superior <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a> over <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. Former <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> manager <a href="Walter%20Smith">Walter Smith</a> then took over from Kendall in the summer of 1998, but only managed three successive finishes in the bottom half of the table. The Everton board finally ran out of patience with Smith, and he was sacked in March 2002 after an FA Cup exit at <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> and with Everton in real danger of relegation. His replacement, <a href="David%20Moyes">David Moyes</a>, guided Everton to a safe finish in fifteenth place.
In <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League">2002–03</a> Everton finished seventh, which was their highest finish since 1996. It was under Moyes' management that <a href="Wayne%20Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> broke into the first team before being sold to Manchester United for a club record fee of £28 million in the summer of 2004. A fourth-place finish in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Premier%20League">2004–05</a> ensured that Everton qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> qualifying round. The team failed to make it through to the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League group stage</a> and were then eliminated from the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. Everton qualified for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">2007–08</a> and <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">2008–09 UEFA Cup</a> competitions, and was the runner-up in the <a href="2009%20FA%20Cup%20final">2009 FA Cup final</a>. During this period, Moyes broke the club record for highest transfer fee paid on four occasions: signing <a href="James%20Beattie%20%28footballer%29">James Beattie</a> for £6 million in January 2005, <a href="Andrew%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29">Andy Johnson</a> for £8.6 million in summer 2006, <a href="Yakubu%20%28footballer%29">Yakubu</a> for £11.25 million in summer 2007, and <a href="Marouane%20Fellaini">Marouane Fellaini</a> for £15 million in September 2008.
At the end of the 2012–13 season, Moyes left his position at Everton to take over at <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, bringing in staff from Everton to join him in July (assistant manager Steve Round, goalkeeping coach Chris Woods and coach Jimmy Lumsden), with Everton players <a href="Phil%20Neville">Phil Neville</a> and <a href="Marouane%20Fellaini">Marouane Fellaini</a> also leaving for United, the former joining the coaching staff. Moyes was replaced by <a href="Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Roberto Martínez</a>, who led Everton to 5th place in the Premier League in his <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">first season</a> while amassing the club's best points tally in 27 years with 72. The following season, Martínez led Everton to the last 16 of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2014-15 UEFA Europa League</a>, where they were defeated by <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a>, whilst domestically finishing 11th in the Premier League. Everton reached the semi-finals of both the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> and the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> in 2015–16, but were defeated in both. After a poor run of form in the Premier League, Martínez was sacked following the penultimate game of the season, with Everton lying in 12th place.
Martínez was replaced in the summer of 2016 by <a href="Ronald%20Koeman">Ronald Koeman</a>, who left <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> to sign a three-year contract with Everton. In <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Premier%20League">his first season</a> at the club, he qualified for the Europa League, but a poor start to the 2017–18 season left Everton in the relegation zone after nine games, and Koeman was sacked on 23 October following a 5–2 home defeat to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. <a href="Sam%20Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</a> was appointed Everton manager in November 2017, but he resigned at the end of the season amid fan discontent at his style of play.
<a href="Marco%20Silva">Marco Silva</a> was named Everton manager in May 2018. In November that year, the club was banned from signing academy football players from their youth clubs for two years. Silva led Everton to finish 8th in his first season in charge, but after a poor start to the following season which left the team in the relegation zone on 14 points, he was sacked on 5 December 2019. His last league match was a 5–2 loss to Liverpool at Anfield. Former player and first-team coach <a href="Duncan%20Ferguson">Duncan Ferguson</a> stepped in as caretaker manager for the next three games before his replacement, <a href="Carlo%20Ancelotti">Carlo Ancelotti</a>; Ferguson stayed as assistant manager.
Ancelotti left the club in June 2021 to rejoin former club <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> as manager, having led the club to a 10th-place finish in his only full season at the club. Former Liverpool manager <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a> was appointed as his replacement, subsequently becoming only the second person to manage both Liverpool and Everton. He was dismissed in January 2022 following 9 losses in his last 13 games in charge at the club, and was replaced by former Chelsea boss <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard</a>. Lampard was later also dismissed in January 2023 after extremely poor performance. Everton narrowly escaped relegation with a 1–0 win over <a href="AFC%20Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> in their last game of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Premier%20League">2022–23 Premier League</a>.
On 17 November 2023, the club received a 10-point deduction with immediate effect for breaches of the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. The club had made losses of £124.5 million in the three years up to 2021–22, with the limit being £105 million. It was the biggest points deduction in Premier League history, surpassing the nine taken from <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> in 2010. Everton submitted an appeal to the decision, arguing that the commission was biased and that the punishment was excessive and unfair. On 24 January 2024, Everton were charged with further breaches of Premier League financial rules after "sustaining losses above the permitted thresholds for the assessment period ending season 2022-23".
Colours.
Everton's traditional home colours are royal blue shirts, white shorts and white socks. However, during the first decades of their history, Everton had several different kit colours. The team originally played in white and then blue and white stripes, but as new players arriving at the club wore their old team's shirts during matches, confusion soon ensued. It was decided that the shirts would be dyed black, both to save on expenses and to instill a more professional look. However, the kit appeared morbid, so a scarlet sash was added. When the club moved to Goodison Park in 1892, the colours were salmon pink and dark blue striped shirts with dark blue shorts. The club later switched to ruby shirts with blue trim and dark blue shorts. Royal blue jerseys with white shorts were first used in the <a href="1901%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">1901–02</a> season. The club played in sky blue in 1906; however, the fans protested, and the colour reverted to royal blue. Occasionally, Everton have played in lighter shades than royal blue (such as in <a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20in%20English%20football">1930–31</a> and <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a>). The home kit today is royal blue shirts with white shorts and socks. The club may also wear all blue to avoid any colour clashes.
Everton's traditional away colours were white shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common. Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Black, white, grey, and yellow away shirts have also been used.
Crest.
At the end of the <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20in%20English%20football">1937–38</a> season, Everton secretary <a href="Theo%20Kelly">Theo Kelly</a>, who later became the club's first manager, wanted to design a club necktie. It was agreed that the colour be blue, and Kelly was given the task of designing a crest to be featured on the necktie. He worked on it for four months until deciding on a reproduction of <a href="Everton%20Lock-Up">Everton Lock-Up</a>, which stands in the heart of the <a href="Everton%2C%20Liverpool">Everton district</a>. The Lock-Up has been linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787. It was originally used as a <a href="village%20lock-up">bridewell</a> to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals and it still stands on Everton Brow. The Lock-Up was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and, according to the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> in London, Kelly chose to include the <a href="laurel%20wreath">laurels</a> as they were the sign of winners. The crest was accompanied by the club motto, ""<a href="Nil%20satis%20nisi%20optimum">Nil satis nisi optimum</a>"", meaning "Nothing but the best is good enough". The ties were first worn by Kelly and the Everton chairman, Mr. E. Green, on the first day of the <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20in%20English%20football">1938–39</a> season.
The club rarely incorporated a badge of any description on their shirts. An interwoven "EFC" design was adopted between 1922 and 1930 before the club reverted to plain royal blue shirts until 1972 when bold "EFC" lettering was added. The crest designed by Kelly was first used on the team's shirts in 1978 and has remained there ever since, while undergoing gradual change to become the version used today.
In May 2013, the club launched a new crest to improve the reproducibility of the design in print and broadcast media, particularly on a small scale. Critics suggested that it was external pressure from sports manufacturer <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike, Inc.</a> that evoked the redesign as the number of colours had been reduced and the radial effect was removed, which made the kit more cost efficient to reproduce. The redesign was poorly received by supporters, with a poll on an Everton fan site registering a 91% negative response to the crest. A protest petition reached over 22,000 signatures before the club offered an apology and announced a new crest would be created for the 2014–15 season with an emphasis on fan consultation. Shortly afterwards, the Head of Marketing left the club. The latest crest was revealed by the club on 3 October 2013. After a consultation process with the supporters, three new crests were shortlisted. In the final vote, the new crest was chosen by almost 80% of the supporters that took part and began being used in July 2014.
Nickname.
Everton's most widely recognised nickname is "The Toffees" or "The Toffeemen", which came about after Everton had moved to Goodison. There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being that there was a business in <a href="Everton%2C%20Liverpool">Everton village</a>, between Everton Brow and Brow Side, named Mother Noblett's, which was a <a href="toffee">toffee</a> shop that sold sweets including the <a href="Humbug%20%28sweet%29%23Everton%20mints">Everton Mint</a>. It was also located opposite the <a href="Everton%20Lock-Up">lock-up</a> on which Everton's club crest is based. The Toffee Lady tradition, in which a girl walks around the perimeter of the pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd, symbolises the connection. Another possible reason is that there was a house named "Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House" in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell. The toffee house was located near the Queen's Head hotel in which early club meetings took place.
Everton have had many other nicknames over the years. When the black kit was worn, the team were nicknamed "The Black Watch" after the <a href="Black%20Watch">famous army regiment</a>. Since going blue in 1901, the team have been given the simple nickname "The Blues". Everton's attractive style of play led to <a href="Steve%20Bloomer">Steve Bloomer</a> calling the team "scientific" in 1928, which is thought to have inspired the nickname "The School of Science". The battling 1995 FA Cup winning side were known collectively as "The Dogs of War". In 2002, when David Moyes arrived as manager, he proclaimed Everton "The People's Club", which has been adopted as a semi-official club nickname.
Stadium.
Everton originally played in the southeast corner of <a href="Stanley%20Park%2C%20Liverpool">Stanley Park</a>. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a man named J. Cruitt donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home. In 1884 Everton became tenants at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>, which was owned by John Orrell, a land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding. Orrell lent Anfield to the club in exchange for a small rent. Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885 and effectively became Everton's landlord by charging the club rent, which increased from £100 to £240 a year by 1888 – and was still rising until Everton left the ground in 1892. The club regarded the increase in rent as unacceptable. A further dispute between Houlding and the club's committee led to Houlding attempting to gain full control of the club by registering the company, "Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd". Everton left Anfield for a new ground, <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a>, where the club has played ever since. Houlding attempted to take over Everton's name, colours, fixtures and league position, but was denied by <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a>. Instead, Houlding formed a new club, <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool F.C</a>.
Goodison Park, the first major football stadium to be built in England, was opened in 1892. Goodison Park has staged more top-flight football games than any other ground in the United Kingdom and was the only English club ground to host a semi-final at the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 FIFA World Cup</a>. It was also the first English ground to have under-soil heating and the first to have two tiers on all sides. The church grounds of St Luke the Evangelist are adjacent to the corner of the Main Stand and the Howard Kendall Gwladys Street End.
On match days, in a tradition going back to 1962, players walk out to the tune "<a href="Theme%20from%20Z-Cars">Johnny Todd</a>", played in the arrangement used when it was the theme song for "<a href="Z-Cars">Z-Cars</a>". It is a traditional Liverpool children's song collected in 1890 by <a href="Frank%20Kidson">Frank Kidson</a> and tells the story of a sailor betrayed by his lover while away at sea. On two occasions in 1994, the club walked out to different songs. In August 1994, the club played <a href="2%20Unlimited">2 Unlimited</a>'s song "<a href="Get%20Ready%20For%20This">Get Ready For This</a>". A month later, the club used a reworking of the <a href="Creedence%20Clearwater%20Revival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> classic "<a href="Bad%20Moon%20Rising%20%28song%29">Bad Moon Rising</a>". Both songs were met with complete disapproval by Everton fans.
Training facilities.
From 1966 to 2007, Everton trained at <a href="Bellefield">Bellefield</a> in the <a href="West%20Derby">West Derby</a> area of Liverpool. The club moved to the <a href="Finch%20Farm">Finch Farm</a> training complex in <a href="Halewood">Halewood</a> in 2007. The training ground houses both the Everton first team and the youth academy.
Everton Stadium.
There have been indications since 1996 that Everton will move to a new stadium. The original plan was for a new 60,000-seat stadium, but in 2000 a proposal was submitted to build a 55,000-seat stadium as part of the <a href="King%27s%20Dock%2C%20Port%20of%20Liverpool">King's Dock</a> regeneration. This proposal was unsuccessful as Everton failed to generate the £30 million needed for a half stake in the stadium project, and the city council rejected the proposal in 2003. Late in 2004, driven by the Liverpool Council and the Northwest Development Corporation, the club entered talks with <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> about sharing a proposed stadium on <a href="Stanley%20Park%2C%20Liverpool">Stanley Park</a>. However, negotiations broke down as Everton failed to raise 50% of the costs. On 11 January 2005, Liverpool announced that ground-sharing was not a possibility and proceeded to plan their own <a href="Stanley%20Park%20Stadium">Stanley Park Stadium</a>.
Following a unanimous approval by Liverpool City Council to grant planning permission in July 2021, work by contractors, Laing O'Rourke, began on the new stadium on 10 August 2021. The first phase involved infilling the dock with 500,000 cubic metres of sea-dredged sand, and so 2,500 vertical concrete piles have been inserted. Its capacity will be 52,888. It is due to open for the start of the 2024–25 season, replacing Goodison Park at an estimated cost of £760 million.
Supporters and rivalries.
Everton has a large fanbase, with the eighth-highest average attendance in the Premier League in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">2008–09</a> season. The majority of Everton's matchday support comes from the <a href="North%20West%20of%20England">North West of England</a>, primarily <a href="Merseyside">Merseyside</a>, Cheshire, <a href="West%20Lancashire">West Lancashire</a> and parts of Western <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a> along with many fans who travel from <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a>, Ireland, and Scotland. Within the city of Liverpool, support for Everton and city rivals Liverpool is not determined by geographical basis with supporters mixed across the city. Everton also has many supporters' clubs worldwide in places such as North America, Singapore, Indonesia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Australia. <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> is an Everton supporter. The official supporters club is "FOREVERTON", and there are also several <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s including "When Skies are Grey" and "Speke from the Harbour", which are sold around Goodison Park on match days.
Everton regularly take large numbers away from home both domestically and in European fixtures. The club implements a loyalty points scheme offering the first opportunity to purchase away tickets to season ticket holders who have attended the most away matches. Everton often sell out the full allocation in away grounds, and tickets sell particularly well for <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a> away matches. In October 2009, Everton took 7,000 travelling fans to <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>, which was their largest ever away crowd in Europe since the <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Winners' Cup Final</a>.
Everton's biggest rivalry is with neighbours <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, against whom the club contests the <a href="Merseyside%20derby">Merseyside derby</a>. The rivalry stems from an internal dispute between Everton officials and the owners of Anfield, which was then Everton's home ground. The dispute resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park and the subsequent formation of Liverpool F.C. in 1892. Following these events, a fierce rivalry has existed between Everton and Liverpool, albeit one that is generally perceived as more respectful than many other <a href="Local%20derby">derbies</a> in English football. This was illustrated by a chain of red and blue scarves that were linked between the gates of both grounds across Stanley Park as a tribute to the Liverpool fans killed in the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a>. The derby is usually a sellout fixture and has been known as the "friendly derby" because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side dressed in red and blue inside both <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> and Goodison Park. Recently, on the field, matches have tended to be extremely stormy affairs; the derby has had more <a href="Fouls%20and%20misconduct%20%28association%20football%29">red cards</a> than any other fixture in Premier League history.

Everton F.C. is a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a> with the board of directors holding a majority of the shares. The club's most recent accounts, from May 2014, show a net total debt of £28.1 million, with a turnover of £120.5 million and a profit of £28.2 million. The club's overdraft with <a href="Barclays%20Bank">Barclays Bank</a> is secured against the Premier League's "Basic Award Fund", which is a guaranteed sum given to clubs for competing in the Premier League. Everton agreed to a long-term loan of £30 million with <a href="Bear%20Stearns">Bear Stearns</a> and <a href="Prudential%20plc">Prudential plc</a> in 2002 for a duration of 25 years. The loan was a consolidation of debts at the time as well as a source of capital for new player acquisitions. <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a> is secured as collateral. On 27 February 2016, it was announced that <a href="Farhad%20Moshiri">Farhad Moshiri</a> would buy a 49.9% stake in the club. On 5 September 2023, Everton announced that Miami based <a href="777%20Partners">777 Partners</a> had signed an agreement with Farhad Moshiri to acquire his full 94.1% stake in the club, pending ratification by the Premier League through the owners' and directors' test. Josh Wander, founder and managing partner of 777 Partners said in a club statement that they are "truly humbled" and consider it "a privilege to be able to build on its proud heritage [Everton's] and values."
Figures taken from 2013 to 2014 accounts.
"Total amount of shares owned by board members will remain at 128,781 until further clarification regarding the future of late Chairman <a href="Bill%20Kenwright">Bill Kenwright CBE</a>'s shares in the club."
Shirt sponsors and manufacturers.
Since the 2022–23 season, the club's primary shirt sponsor has been online betting company <a href="Stake.com">Stake.com</a>, after the club announced the early termination of the previous deal with <a href="SportPesa">SportPesa</a> in February 2020. Partners with Stake became a club-record sponsorship deal. Ahead of the Premier League season, the Stake.com features on the front of the men’s and women’s playing shirts as well as appearing on screens and media backdrops at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a> and <a href="Finch%20Farm">Finch Farm</a>. The sponsorship does not extend to the club's <a href="Everton%20F.C.%20%28women%29">women's team</a>, who for the first time are able to sign their own shirt sponsor. Previous sponsors include Cazoo (2020–2022), SportPesa (2017–20), <a href="Chang%20Beer">Chang Beer</a> (2004–17) Hafnia (1979–85), <a href="NEC">NEC</a> (1985–95), Danka (1995–97), <a href="one2one">one2one</a> (1997–2002) and <a href="Kejian">Kejian</a> (2002–04). For the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Everton%20F.C.%20season">2008–09</a> season, Everton sold junior replica jerseys without the current name or logo of their main sponsor <a href="Chang%20beer">Chang beer</a>, which followed a recommendation from the <a href="Portman%20Group">Portman Group</a> that alcoholic brand names be removed from kits sold to children.
Everton's current kit manufacturers – since the 2020–21 season – are <a href="Hummel%20International">Hummel</a>, after a previous deal with <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> was terminated early by the club. Umbro have been the club's kit manufacturer four times (1974–83, 1986–2000, 2004–09, and 2014–20). Other previous manufacturing firms are <a href="Le%20Coq%20Sportif">Le Coq Sportif</a> (1983–86, 2009–12), <a href="Puma%20SE">Puma</a> (2000–04) and <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc">Nike</a> (2012–14).
The club currently has two 'megastores': one located near Goodison Park on Walton Lane named 'Everton One' and one located in the <a href="Liverpool%20One">Liverpool One</a> shopping complex named 'Everton Two', which gives the second store the address 'Everton Two, Liverpool One'.
Financial Fair Play.
In March 2023, the Premier League referred Everton to an independent commission to investigate alleged breaches of <a href="Financial%20Fair%20Play">Financial Fair Play</a> from the 2021-2022 season. The investigation concluded in November 2023 that Everton breached Financial Fair Play regulations after reporting a loss of £371.8m over three years, where under Premier League rules, clubs are allowed to lose a maximum of £105m over three years. As a result, Everton were deducted 10 points, the heaviest punishment in Premier League history. At the time, Everton were on 14 points after 12 games, sitting 14th in the league table; the points deduction dropped Everton to 19th, in the Premier League's relegation zone. Everton said they were "both shocked and disappointed by the ruling of the Premier League's Commission" and had communicated their "intention to appeal the decision to the Premier League." Liverpool <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">MP</a> <a href="Ian%20Byrne">Ian Byrne</a> took the 10-point deduction to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> calling for the suspension of any proceedings and sanctions, describing the deduction as "grossly unfair".
Managers.
The club's current manager is <a href="Sean%20Dyche">Sean Dyche</a>. There have also been four caretaker managers, and before 1939 the team was selected by either the club secretary or by committee. The club's longest-serving manager has been <a href="Harry%20Catterick">Harry Catterick</a>, who was in charge of the team from 1961 to 1973 for 594 first team matches. The Everton manager to win the most domestic and international trophies is <a href="Howard%20Kendall">Howard Kendall</a>, who won two <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> championships, the <a href="1984%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1984 FA Cup</a>, the <a href="1985%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1985 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>, and three <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Charity Shields</a>.
Records and statistics.
<a href="Neville%20Southall">Neville Southall</a> holds the record for the most Everton appearances with 751 first-team matches between 1981 and 1997. The late centre half and former captain <a href="Brian%20Labone">Brian Labone</a> comes in second with 534 matches. The longest serving player is goalkeeper <a href="Ted%20Sagar">Ted Sagar</a>, who played for 23 years between 1929 and 1953. This tenure covered both sides of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and included a total of 495 appearances. Southall also previously held the record for the most league clean sheets during a season with 15. However, this record was beaten during the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Premier%20League">2008–09 season</a> by American goalkeeper <a href="Tim%20Howard">Tim Howard</a>, who ended the season with 17 clean sheets. The club's top goalscorer, with 383 goals in all competitions, is <a href="Dixie%20Dean">Dixie Dean</a>; the second-highest goalscorer is <a href="Graeme%20Sharp">Graeme Sharp</a> with 159. Dean still holds the <a href="English%20football%20records">English national record</a> of most goals in a season with 60.
The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299 against Liverpool on 18 September 1948. Remarkably, there was only one injury at this game, which occurred when Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter and played the <a href="cornet">cornet</a> with St Edward's Orphanage Band. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison. Everton's record transfer paid was to Swansea City for the <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>ic midfielder <a href="Gylfi%20Sigur%C3%B0sson">Gylfi Sigurðsson</a> for a sum of £45m in 2017. The sale of <a href="Romelu%20Lukaku">Romelu Lukaku</a> to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> the same year was for an initial sum of £75m, the largest sum Everton has received for a player and then the largest transfer between two English clubs.
Everton hold the record for the most seasons in England's top tier (Division One/Premier League), with 119 seasons out of 123, as of completion of the 2021–22 season (the club played in Division 2 in 1930–31 and from 1951 to 1954). They are one of six teams to have played in every season of the Premier League since its inception in August 1992 – the others being <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, and <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. Everton against Aston Villa is the most played fixture in England's top flight. As of the 2012–13 season, the two founding members of the Football League have played a record 196 league games.
Everton's community department.
Everton's community department, Everton in the Community (EitC), is a charity that provides sports and other social activities for the local community including for people with disabilities. EitC represents the club in the <a href="European%20Multisport%20Club%20Association">European Multisport Club Association</a>.
Relationships with other clubs.
Everton is connected to many other sports clubs and organisations. It has links with Irish football academy Ballyoulster United in <a href="Celbridge">Celbridge</a>, the Canadian <a href="Ontario%20Soccer%20Association">Ontario Soccer Association</a>, and the Thai <a href="Football%20Association%20of%20Thailand">Football Association</a> (where there is a competition named the Chang-Everton Cup, competed for by local schoolboys). The club also has a football academy in the Cypriot city of <a href="Limassol">Limassol</a> and a partnership agreement with American club <a href="Pittsburgh%20Riverhounds">Pittsburgh Riverhounds</a>.
Everton has links with Chilean team <a href="Everton%20de%20Vi%C3%B1a%20del%20Mar">Everton de Viña del Mar</a>, who were named after the club. On 4 August 2010, the two Evertons played each other in a friendly match at Goodison Park named the "Copa Hermandad" to mark the centenary of the Chilean team. The occasion was organised by the Ruleteros Society, which was founded to promote connections between the two clubs.
