TSV 1860 Munich

, commonly known as TSV 1860 München (; "sechzig" locally ; lettered as ) or 1860 Munich, is a sports club based in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>. The club's <a href="association%20football">football</a> team currently plays in the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>, the third tier of <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German football</a>. 
1860 Munich was one of the founding members of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 1963, becoming West German champions in 1966, and played a total of 20 seasons in the top flight. Since their relegation from the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, 1860 Munich play their home games at the <a href="Gr%C3%BCnwalder%20Stadion">Grünwalder Stadion</a>.
History.
Origins of the club.
The roots of the TSV's founding as a physical fitness and gymnastics association go back to a meeting held 15 July 1848 in a local pub, Buttlesche Brauerei zum Bayerischen Löwen. It was a time of revolutionary foment due to the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20German%20states%23Bavaria">1848 Revolutions</a>, and the club was banned in 1849 by the Bavarian monarchy for "republican activities". The club was formally reestablished on 17 May 1860 and after mergers with a number of other local associations in 1862 was known as Turnverein München. A football department was created on 6 March 1899 and played its first matches against other squads three years later.
1900–1945.
In 1911, the team adopted the familiar lion to their crest and in 1919 was renamed TSV München 1860. By the mid-1920s, they were playing competitive football in the country's upper leagues, like the <a href="Bezirksliga%20Bayern">Bezirksliga Bayern</a>, making a national semi-final appearance in 1927. "Die Löwen" challenged for the championship in 1931, but lost a 3–2 decider to <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>. Two years later, they made another semi-final appearance which they lost to <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> who were on their way to becoming the dominant side in German football through the 1930s and 1940s, both teams were supported and sponsored by the Nazi regime at the time.
In 1933, German football was re-organized under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> into 16 top-flight divisions known as <a href="Gauliga">Gauligen</a>. TSV joined the <a href="Gauliga%20Bayern">Gauliga Bayern</a> where they earned second-place finishes in 1934, 1938 and 1939 before finally winning a division championship in 1941. Their subsequent play-off appearance saw them finish second in their pool to finalist <a href="SK%20Rapid%20Wien">Rapid Wien</a>. The following season they did not advance to the national play-off rounds, but did earn their first major honours by defeating Schalke 04 to win the "Tschammerpokal", known today as the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. TSV returned to the national play-offs again in 1943, progressing to the quarter-finals.
Post war.
After World War II, 1860 played in the top flight <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945-63%29">Oberliga Süd</a> as a mid-table side, suffering relegation for a period of three years in the mid-1950s. However, they delivered when it mattered most in 1963 by winning the league championship and with it automatic entry into Germany's new professional league, the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, ahead of rivals <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, who would have to wait two seasons for their own top flight debut since the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB) did not want two teams from the same city in the new league. 1860 continued to perform well through the mid-1960s: they won their second DFB-Pokal in 1964, played the 1965 <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> final against <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> – losing 2–0. In 1966, they came away as <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> champions and qualified for the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20European%20Cup">1966–67 European Cup</a>, but lost 3–2 on aggregate against <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> in the <a href="1966-67%20European%20Cup%23Second%20round">second round</a>. On 3 June 1967, they finished as runner-up in the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>.
The 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
Those performances were followed by poor showings in three consecutive seasons leading to relegation in 1970 to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963-74%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> (II). It took 1860 seven years to make their way back to the first division, through a three-game play-off contest with <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a>, only to be immediately relegated again. One year later they were back, this time for a two-year stay, then in 1982 they were relegated once again, and then forced into the tier III Amateur <a href="Oberliga%20Bayern">Oberliga Bayern</a> when financial problems led to the club being denied a licence.
The club's exile from the Bundesliga would last a dozen years. They were promoted to the top flight in 1994, but found themselves in immediate danger being sent back down again. President <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Wildmoser">Karl-Heinz Wildmoser</a> and manager <a href="Werner%20Lorant">Werner Lorant</a>, however, made several shrewd purchases, including striker <a href="Olaf%20Bodden">Olaf Bodden</a>, winger <a href="Harald%20Cerny">Harald Cerny</a>, attacking midfielder <a href="Daniel%20Borimirov">Daniel Borimirov</a>, playmaker <a href="Piotr%20Nowak">Peter Nowak</a> and defensive stoppers <a href="Miroslav%20Stevi%C4%87">Miroslav Stević</a>, <a href="Jens%20Jeremies">Jens Jeremies</a> and <a href="Manfred%20Schwabl">Manfred Schwabl</a>. Stars like <a href="Abedi%20Pele">Abedi Pele</a>, <a href="Thomas%20H%C3%A4%C3%9Fler">Thomas Häßler</a> and <a href="Davor%20%C5%A0uker">Davor Šuker</a> played for 1860 as their careers were winding down, becoming crowd favourites and making important contributions.
2000s.
Under the leadership of Wildmoser and Lorant, the combination of proven veterans and young talent helped the club avoid relegation and become a decent mid-table side. 1860 finished fourth in the Bundesliga finish in 2000 and were entered into the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Third%20qualifying%20round">UEFA Champions League Third qualifying round</a>, where they faced <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>. A 3–1 aggregate defeat, however, saw them play in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> that season, advancing to the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Cup">third round</a>, where they were eliminated by <a href="Parma%20Calcio%201913">Parma</a>. The club, however, was unable to build on this success and after some mediocre performances by the team, manager Lorant was fired.
After a decade in the top division, 1860 burnt out in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Bundesliga">2003–04 season</a> with a 17th-place finish that returned the club to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. Wildmoser made the controversial decision to groundshare with hated rivals Bayern Munich in the <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz Arena</a>, a move that outraged fans and led to accusations of a sell-out. His downfall came when he and his son Karl-Heinz Wildmoser Jr. were caught in a bribery scandal around the awarding procedure for the contract to build the stadium.
In addition to closely being relegated to the <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga Süd</a> (III) in the 2005–06 season, 1860 experienced severe financial difficulties. Stadium partner Bayern Munich bought out TSV's 50% interest in the Allianz Arena in late April 2006 for €11 million, providing the club with some immediate financial relief. Following this move, the DFB was satisfied with the financial health of the club and duly issued 1860 a licence to play in the 2. Bundesliga for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%202.%20Bundesliga">2006–07 season</a>.
TSV hired several new managers during its 2. Bundesliga period. The first was <a href="Rudi%20Bommer">Rudi Bommer</a>, followed by <a href="Reiner%20Maurer">Reiner Maurer</a>, <a href="Walter%20Schachner">Walter Schachner</a>, <a href="Marco%20Kurz">Marco Kurz</a> and <a href="Uwe%20Wolf">Uwe Wolf</a>. Also, former <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany national team</a> player <a href="Stefan%20Reuter">Stefan Reuter</a> as a general manager. None of the new managers, however, could lead the squad back to the top-flight Bundesliga. <a href="Ewald%20Lienen">Ewald Lienen</a> coached the team from 13 May 2009 to the end of the 2009–10 season.
2010–present.
<a href="Reiner%20Maurer">Reiner Maurer</a> was hired as manager of 1860 at the start of the 2010–11 season.
1860 came close to insolvency for a second time in five years in 2011 when it needed €8 million to survive. Help was offered to the club by local rival Bayern Munich, to the disgust of the supporters of each club, since Bayern was to lose €50 million in future stadium rent if the club defaulted on its rental contract obligations until 2025. Eventually, the club was rescued by Jordanian investor <a href="Hasan%20Abdullah%20Ismaik">Hasan Abdullah Ismaik</a>, who, for €18 million, purchased 60% of the club's professional team's operating company, 1860 GmbH & Co. KGaA'. However his voting rights being restricted to 49% due to regulations governing German football, which is based around membership-led clubs and not entrepreneurial. H. I. Squared International, a company controlled by Ismaik, took over the marketing of the club from <a href="IMG%20%28company%29">IMG</a>.
The 2014–15 season saw the club finish 16th in the 2. Bundesliga. This meant a place in the relegation play-offs against <a href="Holstein%20Kiel">Holstein Kiel</a>, during which it retained its league place with a 2–1 home win after a 0–0 draw in the first leg. 1860 survived courtesy to an injury time goal by defender <a href="Kai%20B%C3%BClow">Kai Bülow</a> in front of 57,000 spectators in Munich.
In 2016–17, the team finished 16th in the 2. Bundesliga after a 1–2 defeat against <a href="1.%20FC%20Heidenheim">1. FC Heidenheim</a> in the last game of the season. They played 1–1 and 0–2 respectively in the following relegation play-off against <a href="Jahn%20Regensburg">Jahn Regensburg</a> and were therefore officially relegated. Managing director <a href="Ian%20Ayre">Ian Ayre</a> and President Peter Cassalette resigned from their positions the following day. On 2 June 2017, it was announced that 1860 were unable to obtain a 3. Liga licence for the 2017–18 season as a result of investor Hassan Ismaik's unwillingness to pay the necessary fees. As a result, the club was relegated to the <a href="Regionalliga%20Bayern">Regionalliga Bayern</a> for the 2017–18 season.
They spent only one season in the Regionalliga as they won the league in 2017–18, thus securing their return to the 3. Liga.
Reserve team.
The TSV 1860 Munich second team, (previously, until 2005, the TSV 1860 Munich Amateure), have been historically quite successful at the Bavarian level.
The second team struggled during the club's years outside professional football, but rose through the ranks again after the club's revival in the early 1990s and returned to the Bayernliga in 1996, winning the title in its first season there and promotion to the third-tier <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>. The team was relegated to the Bayernliga in 2001, and returned to the Regionalliga Süd in 2004. TSV 1860 Munich II missed out on <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> qualification in the 2007–08 season, and again in the 2012–13 season when it won the newly formed <a href="Regionalliga%20Bayern">Regionalliga Bayern</a> but lost to <a href="SV%20Elversberg">SV Elversberg</a> in the promotion round. Because the first team was relegated to <a href="Regionalliga%20Bayern">Regionalliga Bayern</a> for the 2017–18 season, the reserve team was relegated to the fifth-tier <a href="Bayernliga%20S%C3%BCd">Bayernliga Süd</a>.
The club is the only one in Bavaria to have won the Bayernliga with its first and second team.
Ground.
Originally, 1860 Munich played their home matches in the <a href="Stadion%20an%20der%20Gr%C3%BCnwalderstra%C3%9Fe">Stadion an der Grünwalderstraße</a> (commonly known as "Sechzgerstadion", which means "60er Stadium"). They shared this venue, built in 1911, with city rivals <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> between 1925 and 1972. Both clubs then moved to the new <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20Munich">Olympiastadion</a> built for the 1972 Olympic Games. 1860 Munich moved back to the old ground several times from 1972 on, with the years between 1982 and 1995 being the longest period. In the 2004–05 season, 1860 again played at Sechzger, as the Allianz Arena was being readied.
From 2005 to 2017, 1860 Munich played their home matches in the <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz Arena</a>, which they shared—and until 2006 co-owned—with Bayern Munich. The arena's usual peach lighting was changed to 1860's blue when the team played. The club's inaugural game at the Allianz Arena was a friendly played against <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> on 30 May 2005. On 28 April 2006, 1860 sold its 50% share to Bayern Munich to help resolve a serious financial crisis that saw 1860 facing bankruptcy. On 12 July 2017, Bayern Munich terminated 1860 Munich's rental agreement for Allianz Arena. The club returned to their old stadium, the Grünwalder Stadion.

1. Fußball-Club Nürnberg Verein für Leibesübungen e. V., often called 1. FC Nürnberg (, ) or simply Nürnberg, is a German <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> based in <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, Bavaria. It is best known for its men's <a href="football">football</a> team, who currently compete in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. Founded in 1900, the club initially competed in the <a href="Southern%20German%20football%20championship">Southern German championship</a>, winning their first title in 1916. Their first <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">German championship</a> was won in 1920. Before the inauguration of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 1963, 1.FCN won a further 11 regional championships, including the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd">Oberliga Süd</a> formed in 1945, and were German champions another seven times. The club has won the Bundesliga once and the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> four times.
Since 1963, the club has played their home games at the <a href="Max-Morlock-Stadion">Max-Morlock-Stadion</a> in Nuremberg. Today's club has sections for boxing, handball, hockey (inline skater hockey and ice hockey), rollerblading and ice skating, swimming, skiing, and tennis.
Nürnberg have been relegated from the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a> top tier <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> on nine occasions – beating the record earlier set by <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a>.
History.
Rise of "Der Club".
1. FC Nürnberg was founded on 4 May 1900 by a group of 18 young men who had gathered at local pub Burenhütte to assemble a side committed to playing football rather than <a href="rugby%20football">rugby</a>, one of the other new "English" games becoming popular at the time. By 1909, the team was playing well enough to lay claim to the South German championship. After World War I, Nürnberg would gradually turn their success into the dominance of the country's football. In the period from July 1918 to February 1922, the team would go unbeaten in 104 official matches. As early as 1919, they came to be referred to simply as "Der Club" in recognition of their skill and of their style on and off the field and would go on to become one of the nation's most widely recognized and popular teams.
Nürnberg faced <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">SpVgg Fürth</a> in the first national championship held after the end of World War I, beating the defending champions 2–0. That would be the first of five titles "Der Club" would capture over the course of eight years. In each of those wins, they would shutout their opponents.
The 1922 final was contested by Nürnberg and <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> but never reached a conclusion on the pitch. The match was called on account of darkness after three hours and ten minutes of play, drawn at 2–2. The re-match also went into extra time, and in an era that did not allow for substitutions, that game was called at 1–1 when Nürnberg was reduced to just seven players and the referee ruled <a href="Association%20football%23Players%2C%20equipment%2C%20and%20officials">incorrectly</a> the club could not continue. Considerable wrangling ensued over the decision. The <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB) awarded the win to Hamburger SV under the condition that they renounce the title in the name of "good sportsmanship" – which the side grudgingly did. Ultimately, the Viktoria trophy was not officially presented that year.
After the glory years.
1. FCN's dominance was already beginning to fade when they captured their final trophy of the era in 1927 as the game began to evolve into a more quickly paced contest which did not suit their slower, more deliberate approach. While they continued to field strong sides, other clubs rose to the forefront of German football. In 1934, they lost in the final to <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, a club that would go on to become the strongest side in the era of football in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. Nürnberg would capture national titles just before and after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in 1936 and 1948 in the first post-war national final, and would also take the Tschammerpokal, the forerunner of today's <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, in 1935 and 1939.
Into the modern era.
The post-war period began with the club being integrated into the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Süd</a>, one of the five top divisions in West-Germany at the time. Nürnberg managed to win this league six times until 1963, winning the national championship in 1948. In 1961, 1. FCN captured their eighth national title and appeared in a losing effort in the following year's final. Some consolation was to be had in the team capturing its second DFB-Pokal in 1962. The club's strong play made it an obvious choice to be amongst the 16 teams selected to participate in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional football league, formed in 1963. "Der Club" played as a mid-table side through the league's early years until putting on a dominating performance in 1968 in which it sat atop the league table from the fifth week of play on to the end of the season, en route to its first Bundesliga title. It went on to become the first club to be relegated from the Bundesliga as the reigning champions. This was a result of <a href="Max%20Merkel">Max Merkel</a>'s decision to remove his championship-winning team of veterans – believing that they were too old – in favour of a dozen newcomers.
It would take the club nine years to recover and return from an exile in the second tier, first the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>, then the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga%20South%20%281974%E2%80%9381%29">2. Bundesliga Süd</a>, that included several failed efforts in the promotion rounds. 1. FCN returned to the Bundesliga for a year in 1978, but played to a 17th-place finish and were relegated again. The club immediately played its way back to the top flight, but since then its Bundesliga performances have been stumbling ones, characterized by finishes well down the league table and occasional relegation for a season or two. The side's best recent result was a fifth-place finish in 1988.
The early 1980s also saw the rise of a longstanding and intense friendship between the fans of Nürnberg and those of former archrival Schalke 04. Fans accompany each other's on their respective away games, and the two-season matches between the teams are generally a very laid-back and hospitable affair for all fans involved.
In the mid-1990s, Nürnberg had financial problems, including the conviction of their club treasurer <a href="Ingo%20B%C3%B6bel">Ingo Böbel</a> for fraud and misallocating club finances. This led to their being penalized six points in the 1995–96 season while playing in the 2. Bundesliga. The club was relegated to the third division as a consequence. Improved management saw the club clawing back and return to the top flight eventually.
In 1999, however, 1. FCN suffered what was arguably the worst meltdown in Bundesliga history. Going into the last game of the season, the club sat in 12th place, three points and five goals ahead of <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>, which was sitting in 16th place and seemingly headed to relegation. Nürnberg was closing out the season with what looked to be an easy home game against <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a>, which was also facing relegation. Frankfurt was up against <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a>, the previous season's champions which were in a fight for a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> spot. Therefore, FCN had already begun soliciting season tickets for next Bundesliga season in a letter to current season ticket holders within celebrating successfully avoiding relegation.
The stage was set for an improbable outcome. Nürnberg lost 1–2, with <a href="Frank%20Baumann%20%28footballer%29">Frank Baumann</a> missing a chance to score in the last minute. Every other 1. FCN rival won, including Frankfurt, which routed Kaiserslautern 5–1 with three late tallies – this put the side ahead on goals scored and sent 1. FCN crashing to 16th place and into a shock relegation. 1. FCN was not relegated because they had fewer points than Frankfurt, nor because of a lower goal differential, but on the third tie-breaker – fewer goals scored.
1. FCN rebounded and played in the Bundesliga, but still found itself flirting with relegation from season to season. However, it comfortably avoided relegation in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06 season</a>, finishing eighth in the Bundesliga. After several years of consolidation, Nürnberg seemed back as a force to reckon with in Bundesliga football. Manager Martin Bader's professional and sometimes even spectacular work until spring 2007 (the signing of former <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> captain and Czech international <a href="Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Gal%C3%A1sek">Tomáš Galásek</a>, for example, was greeted with enthusiasm), as well head coach <a href="Hans%20Meyer%20%28footballer%29">Hans Meyer</a>'s tactically modern understanding of football, helped Nürnberg to its most successful play in almost 40 years. In May 2007, the cut for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> was sure and after the triumph over Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal, the "Club" was in the final of that tournament for the first time since 1982. On 26 May, the "Club" won this final against <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> in extra time 3–2, winning the DFB-Pokal again 45 years after the last victory.
In the first round of 2007–08, however, the team could convince no more in Bundesliga. As the team had ended up second in their <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup%23Group%20A">UEFA Cup group</a> in front of later champion <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">Zenit Saint Petersburg</a> after defeating <a href="FC%20Rapid%20Bucure%C8%99ti">Rapid București</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%202007%E2%80%9308%23First%20round">first round</a>, head coach Hans Meyer was allowed to restructure the team, for example by buying Czech international striker <a href="Jan%20Koller">Jan Koller</a> from <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a>. In the consequence of no improvement, Meyer was replaced by <a href="Thomas%20von%20Heesen">Thomas von Heesen</a> after two legs in the second round. The latter one did not do much better, and so 1. FCN was relegated after finishing 16th after losing a 2–0 home match against Schalke 04 on the final matchday. After not meeting the expectations of dominating the 2. Bundesliga, Von Heesen resigned in August and was replaced by his assistant coach, <a href="Michael%20Oenning">Michael Oenning</a>. After a slow start, Oenning was able to guide Nürnberg to a third-place finish and a playoff with 16th placed <a href="FC%20Energie%20Cottbus">Energie Cottbus</a>. Nürnberg won the playoff 5–0 on aggregate, rejoining the Bundesliga. The club was demoted again, however, after the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bundesliga">2013–14 season</a>, finishing 17th with a final matchday loss to Schalke 04. The club finished third in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%202.%20Bundesliga">2015–16 season</a> and qualified for the promotion play-off to the Bundesliga, but lost on aggregate to Eintracht Frankfurt to remain in the 2. Bundesliga for <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%202.%20Bundesliga">2016–17</a>. The club went on to finish 2nd in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%202.%20Bundesliga">2017–2018 season</a>, securing a promotion spot into the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> with an away win against <a href="SV%20Sandhausen">SV Sandhausen</a>. However, they finished dead last the next season and were relegated back to <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>.
In the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%202.%20Bundesliga">2019–20 2. Bundesliga season</a>, they finished in 16th place, and faced a relegation playoff against 3. Liga side <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">Ingolstadt</a>, for which Nürnberg prevailed and saved themselves from a double relegation to the <a href="2020-21%203.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> after winning 3–3 on aggregate score thanks to the away goals rule. The away goal which retained their second-tier status was scored in the sixth minute of injury time in the second leg, thereby keeping them up at the last moment.
Rivals.
<a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">SpVgg Greuther Fürth</a> is 1. FCN's longest standing local rival. The rivalry dates back to the early days of German football when, at times, those two clubs dominated the national championship. The clubs have played 258 matches against one another, the most in German professional football. In 1921, the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany national team</a> consisted only of players from Nürnberg and Fürth for a match against the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a> in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. The players traveled in the same train, but with the Nürnberg players in a carriage at the front of the train and those from Fürth in a carriage at the rear, while team manager <a href="Georg%20B.%20Blaschke">Georg B. Blaschke</a> sat in the middle. A Fürth player scored the first goal of the match but was only congratulated by Fürth players. Allegedly, <a href="Hans%20Sutor">Hans Sutor</a>, a former Fürth player, was forced to leave the team when he married a woman from <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>. He was later signed by 1. FC Nürnberg and was in the team that eventually won three national championships. Both clubs played together in the Bundesliga in 2012–13.
Games against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> are usually the biggest events of the season, as the two clubs are the most successful in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and Germany overall.
Reserve team.
The "1. FC Nürnberg II" (or "1. FC Nürnberg Amateure") qualified for the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> on the strength of a third place in the <a href="Bayernliga">Bayernliga</a> (IV) in 2007–08. The team had been playing in the Bayernlig since 1998, finishing runners-up three times in those years. When not playing in the Bayernlig, the team used to belong to the <a href="Landesliga%20Bayern-Mitte">Landesliga Bayern-Mitte</a>. Nowadays, it plays in tier four <a href="Regionalliga%20Bayern">Regionalliga Bayern</a>.
League results.
Recent seasons.
The recent season-by-season performance of the club:
Honours.
"Der Club" boasted the title of "Deutscher Rekordmeister" as holder of the most championships for over 60 years (although occasionally having to share the honour with <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>) before being overtaken by <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in 1987.
Germany honours its Bundesliga champions by allowing them to display the <a href="Star%20%28sport%20badge%29">gold stars</a> of the "Verdiente Meistervereine" – one star for three titles, two stars for five and three stars for ten. However, currently, only titles earned since 1963 in the Bundesliga are officially recognized. Despite winning the national title nine times, Nürnberg – the country's second-most successful side – is not entitled to sport any championship stars.
Stadium.
"Der Club" plays in the communally-owned Max-Morlock-Stadion. It has been the club's home since 1963, and currently has a capacity of 50,000 spectators following the stadium's most recent expansion during the winter break of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Bundesliga">2009–10 season</a>. The club previously played its matches at the "Zabo" (an abbreviation of Zerzabelshof, the district in which the ground was located).
The stadium was built in 1928 and was known as Stadion der Hitler-Jugend from 1933 to 1945. Originally having a capacity of 40,000 spectators, it was expanded in 1965 to hold 65,000 and subsequently hosted the <a href="1967%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1967 Cup Winners' Cup final</a> between <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>, won 1–0 by the German side. The facility was refurbished for the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 FIFA World Cup</a> and another recently completed renovation allowed it to seat 45,000 for four preliminary round matches and one Round of 16 contest of the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a>.
The Frankenstadion since 2012 bears the commercial name "Grundig Stadion" under an arrangement with a local company. The majority of the fans was in favour of renaming it after club legend <a href="Max%20Morlock">Max Morlock</a>. Morlock's name was finally used in 2017.
The club is currently discussing the possibility of building a new stadium, which is to be completed by 2020. A feasibility study has been commissioned and contact has already been made with potential partners. A new stadium is to be made a pure football stadium. It will be built on the site of Frankenstadion and hold a capacity of 50,000 spectators. However, the club has not yet announced any official plans for a new stadium.

Hertha BSC

Hertha, Berliner Sport-Club e. V., commonly known as Hertha BSC (), and sometimes referred to as Hertha Berlin, Hertha BSC Berlin, or simply Hertha, is a German professional football club based in the locality of <a href="Westend%20%28Berlin%29">Westend</a> of the <a href="Boroughs%20and%20neighborhoods%20of%20Berlin">borough</a> of <a href="Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf">Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf</a> of <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. Hertha BSC plays in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, the second tier of <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football</a>, following <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a> from the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Bundesliga">2022–23</a>. Hertha BSC was founded in 1892, and was a <a href="Founding%20Clubs%20of%20the%20DFB">founding member of the German Football Association</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> in 1900.
The team won the <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">German championship</a> in <a href="1930%20German%20football%20championship">1930</a> and <a href="1931%20German%20football%20championship">1931</a>. Since 1963, Hertha's stadium has been the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a>. The club is known as "Die Alte Dame" in German, which translates to "The Old Lady". In 2002, the sports activities of the professional, amateur, and under-19 teams were separated into "Hertha BSC GmbH & Co. KGaA".
History.
Early years.
The club was formed in 1892 as "BFC Hertha 92", taking its name from a steamship with a blue and white smokestack; one of the four young men who founded the club had taken a day trip on this ship with his father. The name Hertha is a variation on <a href="Nerthus">Nerthus</a>, referring to a fertility goddess from Germanic mythology.
Hertha performed consistently well on the field, including a win in the first Berlin championship final in 1905. In May 1910, Hertha won a friendly match against <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a>, which was considered significant at the time, as England was where the game originated and English clubs dominated the sport. However, their on-field success was not matched financially, and in 1920 the staunchly working-class Hertha merged with the well-heeled club <a href="Berliner%20Sport-Club">Berliner Sport-Club</a> to form "Hertha Berliner Sport-Club". The new team continued to enjoy considerable success in the <a href="Oberliga%20Berlin-Brandenburg">Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg</a>, while also enduring a substantial measure of frustration. The team played its way to the German championship final in six consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1931, but was only able to win the title in 1930 and 1931, with BSC leaving to become an independent club again after the combined side's first championship. Notwithstanding, Hertha emerged as the Germany's second most successful team during the inter-war years.
Play under the Third Reich.
German football was re-organized under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> in 1933 into 16 top-flight divisions, which saw Hertha playing in the <a href="Gauliga%20Berlin-Brandenburg">Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg</a>. The club continued to enjoy success within their division, regularly finishing in the upper half of the table and winning the divisional title in 1935, 1937 and 1944. It faded from prominence, however, unable to advance out of the early rounds of the national championship rounds. Politically, the club was overhauled under <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a>, with Hans Pfeifer, a Nazi party member, being installed as president.
Postwar play.
After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="Allied-occupied%20Germany">occupying Allied authorities</a> banned most organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. Hertha was re-formed late in 1945 as "SG Gesundbrunnen" and resumed play in the Oberliga Berlin – Gruppe C. The 36 teams of the first season of the post-war Oberliga Berlin were reduced to just a dozen the next year, and the club found itself out of first division football and playing in the Amateurliga Berlin. By the end of 1949, it had re-claimed their identity as "Hertha BSC" and earned a return to the top-flight.
Tensions between the <a href="West%20Berlin">western Allies</a> and the <a href="East%20Berlin">Soviets</a> occupying various sectors of the city, and the developing <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, led to chaotic conditions for football in the capital. Hertha was banned from playing against <a href="East%20Germany">East German</a> teams in the 1949–50 season after taking on several players and a coach who had fled the <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> club <a href="Dresdner%20SC">SG Friedrichstadt</a> for <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a>. A number of sides from the eastern half of the city were forced from the Oberliga Berlin to the newly established DDR-Liga beginning with the 1950–51 season.
Through the 1950s, an <a href="Berlin%20derby">intense rivalry</a> developed with <a href="Tennis%20Borussia%20Berlin">Tennis Borussia Berlin</a>. A proposal for a merger between the two clubs in 1958 was rejected, with only three of the 266 members voting in favour.
Being a major Berlin side, Hertha had fans in the entirety of Berlin, but following the division of the city, supporters in <a href="East%20Berlin">East Berlin</a> found it both difficult and dangerous to follow the team. In interviews with long-time supporter Helmut Klopfleisch, he described his difficulties as a supporter in East Berlin. Klopfleisch came from the district of <a href="Pankow">Pankow</a>, and, attending his first home match as a young boy in 1954, he became an instant supporter. He continued to attend home matches at the stadium, but with the construction of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a> in 1961, this became impossible. Despite this, he did not give up. By this time, Hertha played at the <a href="Stadion%20am%20Gesundbrunnen">Stadion am Gesundbrunnen</a>, nicknamed "Die Plumpe". The stadium was located close enough to the Berlin wall for the sounds from the stadium to be heard over the wall. Thus, Klopfleisch and other supporters gathered behind the wall to listen to the home matches. When the crowd at the stadium cheered, Klopfleisch and the others cheered as well. Klopfleisch later came under suspicion from the <a href="Stasi">Stasi</a>, the East German secret police. He was arrested and interrogated on numerous occasions. He also had his passport confiscated and eventually lost his job as an electrician.
Entry to the Bundesliga.
At the time of the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 1963, Hertha was Berlin's reigning champion, and so became an inaugural member of the new professional national league. In spite of finishing clear of the relegation zone, the team was demoted after the <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20Bundesliga">1964–65 season</a> following attempts to bribe players to play in the city under what had become decidedly unpleasant circumstances after the erection of the Berlin Wall. This caused something of a crisis for the Bundesliga which wanted, for political reasons, to continue to have a team in its ranks representing the former capital. Through various machinations, this led to the promotion of <a href="SC%20Tasmania%201900%20Berlin">SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin</a>, which then delivered the worst-ever performance in Bundesliga history. Hertha managed a return to the premier German league in <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Bundesliga">1968–69</a> and developed a solid following, making it Berlin's favourite side.
Hertha, however, was again soon touched by scandal through its involvement with several other clubs in the Bundesliga matchfixing scandal of 1971. In the course of an investigation of Hertha's role, it was also revealed that the club was 6 million <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">DM</a> in debt. Financial disaster was averted through the sale of the team's former home ground.
In spite of this, the team continued to enjoy a fair measure of success on the field through the 1970s with a second place Bundesliga finish behind <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Bundesliga">1974–75</a>, a semi-final appearance in the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20UEFA%20Cup">1978–79 UEFA Cup</a>, and two appearances in the final of the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> (1977 and 1979). The following season saw the fortunes of the team take a turn for the worse as it was relegated to the <a href="2.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BBundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, where it would spend 13 of the next 17 seasons.
Plans in 1982 for a merger with <a href="Tennis%20Borussia%20Berlin">Tennis Borussia Berlin</a>, <a href="Blau-Wei%C3%9F%201890%20Berlin">SpVgg Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin</a> and <a href="SCC%20Berlin">SCC Berlin</a> to form a side derisively referred to as "FC Utopia" never came to fruition. Hertha slipped as low as the third tier Amateur Oberliga Berlin, where it spent two seasons (1986–87 and 1987–88). Two turns in the Bundesliga (1982–83 and 1990–91) saw the team immediately relegated after poor performances. Hertha's amateur side enjoyed a greater measure of success, advancing to the final of the DFB-Pokal in <a href="1993%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1993</a>, where its run ended in a close 0–1 defeat to Bundesliga club <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a>.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hertha became a popular side in East Berlin as well. Two days after the wall came down, 11,000 East Berliners attended Hertha's match against <a href="SG%20Wattenscheid">SG Wattenscheid</a>. A fan friendship with <a href="1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">Union Berlin</a> developed, and a friendly match between the two attracted over 50,000 spectators.
Financial woes once more burdened the club in 1994, as it accumulated 10 million DM of debt. The crisis was again resolved through the sale of real estate holdings, in addition to the signing of a new sponsor and management team. By 1997, Hertha had returned to the Bundesliga, where it generally managed to finish in the upper-third of the league table. When Hertha was promoted in 1997, it ended Berlin's six-year-long drought without a Bundesliga side, which had made the Bundesliga the only top league in Europe without representation from its country's biggest city and capital.
A period of oscillation.
Hertha's return to the Bundesliga began well, with a continuous string of appearances in international play in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> and the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> beginning in the 1999 season, and the signing of key players such as <a href="P%C3%A1l%20D%C3%A1rdai">Pál Dárdai</a> in 1997 who became Hertha's most capped player ever, <a href="Sebastian%20Deisler">Sebastian Deisler</a> in 1999 and Brazilian international <a href="Marcelinho%20Para%C3%ADba">Marcelinho</a> in 2001, who was named the Bundesliga's Player of the Year in 2005. Hertha also invested heavily in its own youth football academy.
Hertha could not maintain its strong run of form, however, and the club's next few years saw dramatic highs and lows. The team was almost relegated in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Bundesliga">2003–04 season</a>, but rebounded and finished fourth the following season, missing out on the Champions League when <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a> held it to a draw on the final day, a result which led to <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> overtaking them for the spot on the final league matchday (as a "thank-you" gesture, Werder sent the Hannover squad 96 bottles of champagne.) In 2005–06, the "Herthaner" finished in sixth position, then qualified for the UEFA Cup after defeating <a href="FC%20Moscow">FC Moscow</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a>. However, Hertha was eliminated in the first round of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> by <a href="Odense%20BK">Odense BK</a>. In <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07</a>, Hertha finished tenth after sacking manager <a href="Falko%20G%C3%B6tz">Falko Götz</a> on 11 April. Hertha started the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a> with new manager <a href="Lucien%20Favre">Lucien Favre</a>, who had won the <a href="National%20League%20A">Swiss championship</a> in 2006 and 2007 with <a href="FC%20Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>. Hertha finished tenth again, but started in the first qualification round of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> via the <a href="UEFA%20Respect%20Fair%20Play%20ranking">UEFA Respect Fair Play ranking</a>, making it as far as the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup%20group%20stage">group stage</a> of the tournament. After a successful campaign in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Bundesliga">2008–09 season</a>, finishing in fourth place and remaining in the title race up until the second to last matchday, the club had a very poor season in <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Bundesliga">2009–10 season</a>, finishing last in the Bundesliga and suffering relegation.
After spending the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%202.%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a> in the 2. Bundesliga, Hertha secured its return to the Bundesliga for <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Bundesliga">2011–12</a> by winning 1–0 at <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a> with three matchdays to play in the season. Hertha, however, finished 16th in the 2011–12 Bundesliga and lost in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Bundesliga%23Relegation%20play-offs">relegation playoff</a> to <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a> to fall back to the 2. Bundesliga.
In <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%202.%20Bundesliga">2012–13</a>, Hertha achieved promotion from the second division as champions for the second time in three seasons. On the opening day of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bundesliga">2013–14 season</a>, the club beat <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> 6–1 at the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a> to top the Bundesliga table at the end of matchday 1.
On 5 February 2015 <a href="P%C3%A1l%20D%C3%A1rdai">Pál Dárdai</a>, Hertha's longest serving and most capped player ever with 366 appearances took over as the manager of the main squad. At the halfway point of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16 Bundesliga season</a>, Hertha lay in third place, its highest position at the winter break since 2008–09. Despite a late-season slump, Hertha still finished in seventh place for the season, its highest finish in the Bundesliga since 2008–09 during which Hertha finished fourth. The seventh-place finish meant the club secured Europa League football for the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2016–17 season</a> by the means of a third round play-off. Hertha lost the third round play-off 3–2 on aggregate to <a href="Br%C3%B8ndby%20IF">Brøndby</a>, winning the first leg 1–0 in Berlin, but losing the second away tie 3–1, with <a href="Teemu%20Pukki">Teemu Pukki</a> scoring a hat-trick for the Danish side.
In the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Bundesliga">2016–17 Bundesliga season</a>, Hertha enjoyed its best ever start to a Bundesliga season in terms of points won during the opening eight matches, losing just one match – away against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> – and forcing a draw away against <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. At the 2016–17 Bundesliga winter break, Hertha stood at third place in the league, with nine wins, three draws and four losses. Hertha finished the season in 6th place and qualified for the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2017–18 Europa League</a>. Their place in the group stage was secured on 27 May 2017, after Borussia Dortmund defeated <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in the <a href="2017%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">2017 DFB–Pokal final</a>.
Lars Windhorst's era.
In June 2019, <a href="Lars%20Windhorst">Lars Windhorst</a> bought a €125 million stake in the club. On 27 November 2019, <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann">Jürgen Klinsmann</a> became the new manager of Hertha BSC, replacing <a href="Ante%20%C4%8Covi%C4%87%20%28Croatian%20footballer%29">Ante Čović</a>. Klinsmann left the club on 11 February 2020, after only 76 days in charge. Assistant manager <a href="Alexander%20Nouri">Alexander Nouri</a> took interim charge of the team, before the permanent appointment of <a href="Bruno%20Labbadia">Bruno Labbadia</a> on 9 April 2020.
In 2020, Windhorst bought an increased stake in the club, bringing his total investment to almost $500 million. But sporting success did not follow.
On 24 January 2021, Labbadia was sacked as Hertha manager, with the club sitting inside the relegation play off places with his replacement being former manager <a href="P%C3%A1l%20D%C3%A1rdai">Pál Dárdai</a>. After nine months in charge and steering the club to safety, Dárdai was terminated as manager and replaced with <a href="Tayfun%20Korkut">Tayfun Korkut</a>. Korkut was terminated after just four months in charge with the club sitting 17th on the table in the relegation zone. Korkut was replaced with <a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a>. Magath managed to steer the club to safety as they won the relegation play-off against <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> 2–1 on aggregate. After avoiding relegation, Magath was replaced with <a href="Sandro%20Schwarz">Sandro Schwarz</a> as manager. Within months of Schwarz's hiring, however, relations between Hertha and Windhorst had deteriorated to the point where Windhorst no longer wanted anything to do with the club. Schwarz was sacked in April 2023 following a 5–2 loss to <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> that left Hertha at the bottom of the table. Pál Dárdai took over the head coaching job for the third time but could not right the ship, and Hertha were relegated.

Since 1963, Hertha BSC has played its matches in Berlin's <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a>, originally built for the <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a>.
The stadium has a permanent capacity of 74,649 seats, making it the largest stadium in Germany in terms of <a href="seating%20capacity">seating capacity</a> and the second largest stadium in Germany, behind the <a href="Westfalenstadion">Signal Iduna Park</a> in <a href="Dortmund">Dortmund</a>, in terms of total capacity. For certain football matches, such as those against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, the capacity can be temporarily expanded. This is made by the addition of mobile grandstand over the Marathon Arch. The extended capacity reached 76,197 seats in 2014.
The stadium underwent major renovations twice, in 1974 and from 2000 to 2004. In both cases, the renovations were for the upcoming <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a>. In the 1974 upgrades, the stadium received a partial roof. It underwent a thorough modernization for the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a>. In addition, the colour of the track was changed to blue to match Hertha's club colours. In addition to Hertha's home games, Olympiastadion serves as one of the home grounds for the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany national football team</a>, and it hosts concerts, track and field competitions, and the annual <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> final. It was also the site for six matches of the 2006 World Cup, including the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">tournament final</a>.
Hertha played its matches on a sports field on the "Exer" on <a href="Sch%C3%B6nhauser%20Allee">Schönhauser Allee</a> in <a href="Prenzlauer%20Berg">Prenzlauer Berg</a> until 1904. This was the first home ground of Hertha. The Exer was a former parade ground of the <a href="1st%20%28Emperor%20Alexander%29%20Guards%20Grenadiers">1st (Emperor Alexander) Guards Grenadiers</a> and the site is today occupied by the <a href="Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark">Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark</a>. Hertha then moved it matches to the Schebera-Sportplatz in the locality of <a href="Gesundbrunnen%20%28Berlin%29">Gesundbrunnen</a> in 1904. The <a href="Stadion%20am%20Gesundbrunnen">Stadion am Gesundbrunnen</a> was built in the area in 1923. The stadium would be nicknamed "Die Plumpe" and had a capacity of 35,000, of which 3,600 seated. Hertha left the stadium when it joined the Bundesliga in 1963. Hertha returned to the site during the Regionalliga years from 1965 to 1968. The sale of the site in 1971 helped the club avoid bankruptcy.
Due to a lack of spectator interest, Hertha played its 2. Bundesliga and Amateurliga matches from 1986 to 1989 at the <a href="Poststadion">Poststadion</a>. The opening fixtures of the 1992–93 season, as well as the Intertoto Cup and UEFA Cup qualifying matches, were played at the <a href="Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark">Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark</a>.
It was confirmed on 23 May 2016 that Hertha will continue to play its home matches at the Olympiastadion until 2025.
New stadium.
On 30 March 2017, Hertha announced its intentions to build a new 55,000 seater stadium, to be ready in 2025 when their contract to play at the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a> runs out. The club noted many factors for this decision, one being that the Berlin side are the only club in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> without a dedicated football stadium. In the announcement, the club acknowledged that the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a> was suitable for major national and international matches, but was too large for the average attendance of a Hertha home game, with only 64% seats being sold; opposed to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> average of 92%. On the announcement, the club stated that its preferred option was to construct its own stadium, with a survey identifying a suitable site in Berlin's Olympic Park close to the Olympiastadion. But, at the same time, Berlin's state government indicated a willingness to consider rebuilding the Olympiastadion itself into a football-only venue. However, following the success of the <a href="2018%20European%20Athletics%20Championships">2018 European Athletics Championships</a> held at the stadium, combined with the potential cost of the conversion, the state government subsequently elected not to proceed, leading Hertha to return to the Olympic Park proposal. However, if that plan was rejected, they also have secondary plans for the stadium to be built in Brandenburg Park, <a href="Ludwigsfelde">Ludwigsfelde</a>.
Colours and kit.
Hertha's club colours are blue and white which come, like its name, from the Hertha steamship. Traditionally, the club wears these colours as stripes, however, since the 1970s, it has employed many different uniforms. 
Between the 70s and the 90s, a variety of plain shirts or shirts with large blocks of colour were used, and the team rarely wore its traditional stripes. In <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Bundesliga">1997</a>, Hertha unveiled a strip with navy blue hoops and shorts, which the team wore for two seasons, abandoning its colours and traditional motif. 
The club reintroduced a very traditional kit for the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Bundesliga">2000/2001 season</a>, however it continuously flirted with navy uniforms throughout the early 2000s, and navy often appears as part of the home uniform, or as the primary colour of <a href="away%20colours">second</a> and <a href="third%20jersey">third</a> choice strips even today. Since the mid-2000s the club has generally opted for a traditional style of uniform.
The Old Lady also has a historically traditional away kit, being a red and black version of their home.

Women's football.
Missing out on a trend of promoting women's football, Hertha became one of a decreasing number of major German football clubs left outside the top of women's football. Several steps had been taken to develop women's football, but most of them ended up inconclusive. The change came in 2009, when the club announced that it was to launch a cooperation in women's football with <a href="1.%20FC%20L%C3%BCbars">1. FC Lübars</a>, a football club from the Berlin borough <a href="Reinickendorf">Reinickendorf</a> and with decades of history in women's football.
From one side, the partnership meant that Hertha was to provide Lübars with various forms of support, including financial support, expertise in licensing and sponsor acquisition, equipment and training instruction – investing approximately 1 million Euros in the project. From the other side, the partnership meant that Lübars was to compete in the colours of Hertha, thus earning the nickname "Die Hertha-Frauen" ("The Hertha-women"). In the long run, the club plans for the team of 1. FC Lübars to be integrated with Hertha BSC. 1. FC Lübars now competes in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga%20%28women%29">2. Bundesliga of women's football</a>.

VfL Wolfsburg

Verein für Leibesübungen Wolfsburg e. V., commonly known as VfL Wolfsburg () or Wolfsburg, is a German professional <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> based in <a href="Wolfsburg">Wolfsburg</a>, <a href="Lower%20Saxony">Lower Saxony</a>. The club grew out of a multi-sports club for <a href="Volkswagen%20worker%20organizations">Volkswagen workers</a> in the city of Wolfsburg. It is best known for its <a href="association%20football">football</a> department, but other departments include <a href="badminton">badminton</a>, <a href="handball">handball</a> and <a href="Athletics%20%28sport%29">athletics</a>.
The men's professional football team play in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, the top tier of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>. Wolfsburg have won the Bundesliga once in their history, in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Bundesliga">2008–09</a> season, the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> in <a href="2015%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">2015</a> and the <a href="DFL-Supercup">DFL-Supercup</a> in <a href="2015%20DFL-Supercup">2015</a>.
Professional football is run by the spin-off organization "VfL Wolfsburg-Fußball GmbH", a wholly owned subsidiary of the <a href="Volkswagen%20Group">Volkswagen Group</a>. Since 2002, Wolfsburg's stadium is the <a href="Volkswagen%20Arena">Volkswagen Arena</a>.
History.
Foundation.
The city of Wolfsburg was founded in 1938 as Stadt des KdF-Wagen to house autoworkers building the car that would later become famous as the <a href="Volkswagen%20Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a>. The first football club affiliated with the autoworks was known as "BSG Volkswagenwerk Stadt des KdF-Wagen", a <a href="works%20team">works team</a>. This team played in the first division Gauliga Osthannover in the 1943–44 and 1944–45 seasons.
On 12 September 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, a new club was formed and was known briefly as "VSK Wolfsburg". This side began play in the green and white still worn by "VfL" today; local youth trainer Bernd Elberskirch had ten green jerseys at his disposal and white bed sheets donated by the public were sewn together by local women to make shorts.
On 15 December 1945, the club went through a crisis that almost ended its existence when all but one of its players left to join "1. FC Wolfsburg". The only player remaining, Josef Meyer, worked with Willi Hilbert to rebuild the side by signing new players. The new group adopted the moniker "VfL Wolfsburg", VfL standing for Verein für Leibesübungen. This can be translated as "club for gymnastics" or "club for exercises." Within a year they captured the local <a href="Gifhorn">Gifhorn</a> title. In late November 1946, the club played a friendly against longtime <a href="Gelsenkirchen">Gelsenkirchen</a> powerhouse <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> at the stadium owned by Volkswagen, emerging as the successor to "BSG" as the company sponsored side.
Postwar play.
The club made slow but steady progress in the following seasons. They captured a number of amateur level championships, but were unable to advance out of the promotion playoffs until finally breaking through to the top tier Oberliga Nord in 1954 with a 2–1 victory over <a href="Heider%20SV">Heider SV</a>. Wolfsburg, however, struggled in the top flight, narrowly missing relegation each season until finally being sent down in 1959. When Germany's first professional football league, the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, was formed in 1963, Wolfsburg was playing in the Regionalliga Nord (II), having just moved up from the Verbandsliga Niedersachsen (III), reaching the German Amateur Championship Final that same year (0–1 vs. <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart%20II">VfB Stuttgart Amat.</a>).
Second division and advance to the Bundesliga.
Wolfsburg remained a second division fixture over the next dozen years with their best performance being a second-place finish in 1970. That finish earned the club entry to the promotion round playoffs for the Bundesliga, where they performed poorly and were unable to advance. From the mid-1970s through to the early 1990s, Wolfsburg played as a third division side in the Amateur Oberliga Nord. Consecutive first-place finishes in 1991 and 1992, followed by success in the promotion playoffs, saw the club advance to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> for the 1992–93 season.
Wolfsburg continued to enjoy some success through the 1990s. The team advanced to the final of the <a href="German%20Cup">German Cup</a> in 1995 where they were beaten 0–3 by <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, but then went on to the top flight on the strength of a second-place league finish in 1997.
Early predictions were that the club would immediately be sent back down, but instead, Wolfsburg developed into a mid-table Bundesliga side. In the 1998–99 season, Wolfsburg, under <a href="Wolfgang%20Wolf">Wolfgang Wolf</a>, were holding onto the fifth spot in the 33rd round of fixtures, and they had hopes of making fourth place, to gain <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League%201999%E2%80%9300">UEFA Champions League</a> participation. Losing 6–1 away to <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a> in the final fixture, Wolfsburg finished in sixth place with 55 points and qualified for next season's <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. They also qualified for the <a href="Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a> in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2005, enjoying their best run in 2003 after reaching the final in which they lost to Italian side <a href="A.C.%20Perugia%20Calcio">Perugia</a>. This was followed by a couple of seasons of little success for the club, just narrowly avoiding relegation with two 15th-place finishes in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06</a> and <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07 seasons</a>.
2008–present.
For the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a>, the club hired former <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> manager <a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a>, with whom they managed to finish in fifth place at the end of the season, the highest finish for the club at the time. This also enabled the Wolves to qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> for only the second time in their history.
In the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Bundesliga">2008–09 season</a>, under Magath, Wolfsburg claimed their biggest success by winning their first Bundesliga title after defeating <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> 5–1 on 23 May 2009. During this campaign, Wolfsburg equalled the longest winning streak in one Bundesliga season with ten successive victories after the winter break. They also became the only team in the Bundesliga to have had two strikers scoring more than 20 goals each in one season, with Brazilian <a href="Grafite">Grafite</a> and Bosnian <a href="Edin%20D%C5%BEeko">Edin Džeko</a> achieving this feat in their title-winning season, scoring 28 and 26, respectively, with <a href="Zvjezdan%20Misimovi%C4%87">Zvjezdan Misimović</a> adding a record 20 assists. As a result of their title win, Wolfsburg qualified for the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the first time in their history.
In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Bundesliga">2009–10 season</a>, Wolfsburg dismissed their newly appointed trainer <a href="Armin%20Veh">Armin Veh</a> after the winter break due to lack of success, with the club sitting tenth in the league. In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, they came third in their group, behind <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and <a href="PFC%20CSKA%20Moscow">CSKA Moscow</a>, losing the chance for a place in the competition's successive round. As a result, they qualified for the Round of 32 phase of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>. They defeated Spanish side <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a> 6–3 on aggregate and Russian champions <a href="FC%20Rubin%20Kazan">Rubin Kazan</a> 3–2. In the quarter-finals, however, they were beaten 3–1 by eventual finalists <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>.
On 11 May 2010, the permanent head coach's position was filled by former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> manager <a href="Steve%20McClaren">Steve McClaren</a>. After having guided <a href="FC%20Twente">Twente</a> to their first ever <a href="Eredivisie">Dutch title</a>, he was rewarded by becoming the first English coach to manage a Bundesliga side. On 7 February 2011, however, it was announced that McClaren had been sacked and that <a href="Pierre%20Littbarski">Pierre Littbarski</a> would be taking over. Wolfsburg lost four times in five matches under him and they finally slipped into the relegation places.
On 18 March 2011, Wolfsburg confirmed that Felix Magath would return as head coach and sporting director, almost two years since he led them to the Bundesliga title and just two days after being fired from his position at <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>. He signed a two-year contract with the club. Magath steered the club to safety, but though the club invested heavily, Magath could only achieve a mid-table finish in the following 2011–12 season. After only five points in eight matches (and no goals and points in the last four games) in the 2012–13 season, Magath left the club by mutual consent, and was temporarily replaced by former Wolfsburg reserve team coach <a href="Lorenz-G%C3%BCnther%20K%C3%B6stner">Lorenz-Günther Köstner</a>. On 22 December 2012, the former <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> head coach <a href="Dieter%20Hecking">Dieter Hecking</a> was appointed as Wolfsburg's new head coach on a contract lasting until 2016.
On 2 February 2015, Wolfsburg purchased the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">German international</a> forward <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Sch%C3%BCrrle">André Schürrle</a> for a fee of €30 million from <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. With a reinforced squad, the club finished as runners-up in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15 Bundesliga</a> behind Bayern Munich, thus automatically qualifying for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2015–16 Champions League</a> group stage. On 30 May, the team then won the <a href="2015%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">2015 DFB-Pokal Final</a> 3–1 against <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, the first German Cup victory in the history of the club.
On 1 August, to begin the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20VfL%20Wolfsburg%20season">2015–16 season</a>, Wolfsburg defeated the Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich in the <a href="2015%20DFL-Supercup">2015 DFL-Supercup</a> on penalties. At the end of the 2015 summer transfer window, Wolfsburg sold the 2014–15 <a href="Footballer%20of%20the%20Year%20%28Germany%29">Footballer of the Year (Germany)</a> <a href="Kevin%20De%20Bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</a> to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> for a reported Bundesliga record fee of €75 million.
The 2015–16 campaign saw Wolfsburg finish in eighth place. The Bundesliga match between Bayern and Wolfsburg saw an extraordinary five goals in nine minutes by <a href="Robert%20Lewandowski">Robert Lewandowski</a>. In the Champions League, they reached the quarter-finals for the first time, where they faced <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> and, despite a two-goal aggregate lead from the first match, were eliminated after losing 3–0 at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>.
In January 2017, Wolfsburg signed a <a href="letter%20of%20intent">letter of intent</a> to partner the American side <a href="Chattanooga%20FC">Chattanooga FC</a>, which includes women's football, youth development and local social responsibility. The two teams mentioned the future possibility of international friendlies.
Wolfsburg struggled through the 2016–17 season, rotating through several managers and eventually finishing in 16th place in the Bundesliga with only 37 points, putting them in a playoff against <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a>, which they won 2–0 on aggregate to remain in the top flight.
The 2017–18 season proved to be another disappointing season, in which they finished 16th place in the Bundesliga, putting them in a play-off against <a href="Holstein%20Kiel">Holstein Kiel</a>, a game that they won 4–1 on aggregate.
In the 2018–19 season, Wolfsburg finished 6th in the Bundesliga, thus automatically qualifying for the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2019–20 UEFA Europa League</a>.
In the draw for the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%23Third%20qualifying%20round">Europa League third qualifying round</a>, Wolfsburg drew the Ukrainian Team <a href="FC%20Desna%20Chernihiv">Desna Chernihiv</a>. Wolfsburg won 2–0 at the <a href="AOK%20Stadion">AOK Stadion</a>, advancing to the play-off round. At the play-off round they lost 2–1 against <a href="AEK%20Athens%20F.C.">AEK Athens</a>.
On 24 May 2022, Niko Kovač was appointed as Wolfsburg's new head coach, with a contract lasting until June 2025.
Home stadium.
Wolfsburg plays at the <a href="Volkswagen%20Arena">Volkswagen Arena</a>, a multi-purpose stadium which seats a total capacity of 30,000 spectators. Before construction was finished in 2002, Wolfsburg played their home games at the 21,600 capacity <a href="VfL-Stadium">VfL-Stadium</a>. The stadium is currently used mostly for the home games of Wolfsburg, and is the site where they won their first Bundesliga title in the 2008–09 season. The amateur squad and the <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg%20%28women%29">women's association football section</a> is playing since 2015 at the newly built AOK Stadion with a capacity of 5200 people.

Arminia Bielefeld

DSC Arminia Bielefeld (; full name: ; commonly known as Arminia Bielefeld (), also known as "Die Arminen" or "Die Blauen" ), or just Arminia (), is a German <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> from <a href="Bielefeld">Bielefeld</a>, North Rhine-Westphalia. Just like association football, Arminia offers the sports of <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a>, <a href="figure%20skating">figure skating</a>, and <a href="cue%20sports">cue sports</a>. The club has 12,000 members and the club colours are black, white and blue. Arminia's name derives from the <a href="Cherusci">Cherusc</a>an chieftain <a href="Arminius">Arminius</a>, who defeated a <a href="Roman%20army">Roman army</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Teutoburg%20Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg Forest</a>.
The club is dominated by its professional football team, which will play in the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> in the 2023–24 season. The team mostly played in the first or second tier of the German football league system, among them 17 seasons in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. Arminia's most successful years were the 1920s, the early 1980s and the middle 2000s. In 1947 and in the 1950s, Arminia had sunk down to a team playing in a rather local area in the third tier (later third tiers covered larger areas).
Arminia has been playing their home games at the <a href="Bielefelder%20Alm">Bielefelder Alm</a> Stadium since 1926. Since 2004, the stadium has been named "SchücoArena" through a sponsorship deal.
History.
Arminia Bielefeld was founded on 3 May 1905 as "1. Bielefelder FC Arminia". The fourteen men who founded the club were from the local bourgeoisie. Two weeks later, the club played its first match against a team from <a href="Osnabr%C3%BCck">Osnabrück</a>. Neither the name of the opponent nor the result are known. The club was admitted to the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> in the same year and started to play in a league (in one consisting only of Arminia and three teams from Osnabrück, at first) in 1906. In 1907, local rivals "FC Siegfried" joined Arminia, a move which strengthened Arminia's squad. Soon other clubs from Bielefeld joined League football.
After playing on various grounds, Arminia moved to a new home at the Pottenau in 1910. Their first big achievement came in 1912, when they won the Westphalian championship after a 5–1 win over <a href="BV%2004%20Dortmund">BV 04 Dortmund</a> in the final. The outbreak of World War I interrupted Arminia's rise to the top. In 1919, Arminia merged with "Bielefelder Turngemeinde 1848" to form "TG Arminia Bielefeld". However, the two merged teams dissolved the merger in 1922 and both parent clubs were formed again.
1922–1945.
Arminia won the West German championship in 1922. Originally, they were level on points with <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln%23Predecessor%20sides">Kölner BC 01</a>, but Köln fielded an ineligible player in one match. Arminia played for the first time in the German Championships, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals after losing 0–5 to <a href="FC%20Wacker%20M%C3%BCnchen">FC Wacker München</a>. In 1923, Arminia won their second West German championship in a dramatic way. They trailed <a href="TuRU%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">TuRU Düsseldorf</a> 1–3 at half time of the final, but came from behind to win 4–3 after extra time. Arminia faced <a href="Union%20Obersch%C3%B6neweide">Union Oberschöneweide</a> in the quarter-finals of the German championships. The match ended goalless, so a replay was held. Arminia led 1–0 and suffered the equalizer in injury time. The Berlin side won the match after extra time. <a href="Walter%20Claus-Oehler">Walter Claus-Oehler</a> became Arminia's first player to win a cap in the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">German national team</a>. Arminia won further Westphalian titles from 1924 to 1927, but were unable to repeat their success in the West German Championships. A match between <a href="SC%20Preu%C3%9Fen%20M%C3%BCnster">SC Preußen Münster</a> and Arminia in November 1925 was the first football match to be broadcast on German Radio. On 30 January 1926, the club took its current name "Deutscher Sportclub Arminia Bielefeld". Their next piece of silverware was won in 1932 with a triumph in the Westphalian cup.
In 1933, Arminia qualified for the <a href="Gauliga%20Westfalen">Gauliga Westfalen</a>, from which they were relegated after the inaugural season. Three attempts of gaining promotion failed before their return to the top flight was won in 1938. Their best performance in the Gauliga was the 1939–40 campaign, where Arminia finished second. Two years later, Arminia was one of only two teams to win a match at <a href="Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>. On 25 July 1943 Arminia merged with local rivals "VfB 03 Bielefeld". The merger finished the 1943–44 season in last place.
Post World War II.
After World War II, a new league with all teams who competed in the Gauliga Westfalen was formed. Arminia were relegated and failed to win re-promotion. In 1947–48, Arminia were a third division side for the first time in their history. After a dominating season in the Bezirksklasse, Arminia was docked 14 points because they fielded an ineligible player. The next season was already under way when the Landesliga (II) was expanded by two teams. Arminia took their chance, won the league and gained promotion to the <a href="Oberliga%20West%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga West</a>.
The dream lasted for only a year. Arminia beat <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> 4–2 at home but finished only second from the bottom. In 1954, Arminia were even relegated to the third tier, the "Landesliga Westfalen, Gruppe Ostwestfalen", a league only covering the north-eastern part of Westphalia. In 1956, Arminia qualified for a new third tier, the "Verbandsliga Westfalen, Gruppe Ostwestfalen", which encompassed a slightly larger area. Only in 1962, did Arminia become a second division side again (then: 2. Liga West, covering the whole of North Rhine-Westphalia). In 1962–63, they had difficulty finishing in seventh place to secure a spot in the newly formed <a href="Regionalliga%20West%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga West</a>, which was situated directly below the new Bundesliga.
Arminia finished their first seasons in mid-table, but became one of the better Regionalliga teams later on. In 1966, Arminia beat <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Alemannia Aachen</a> to win the West German Cup for the first time. A year later, forward Ernst Kuster joined the team; he would become the club's all-time leading goal scorer (more than half a century later, <a href="Fabian%20Klos">Fabian Klos</a> would beat his record). A 0–1 loss to <a href="Wuppertaler%20SV">Wuppertaler SV</a> on the last day of the 1966–67 season stopped Arminia entering the Bundesliga promotion play-offs. Arminia were runners-up in the 1969–70 season, and won their first promotion to the Bundesliga after a 2–0 win at <a href="Tennis%20Borussia%20Berlin">Tennis Borussia Berlin</a> in the play-offs.
The 1970s.
The team had a poor start in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Bundesliga">their first Bundesliga season</a>, but results improved and they finished the season in 14th. However, near the end of the season, it was discovered that Arminia had engaged in match-fixing; three of the ten Bundesliga games which were proven to have been manipulated through bribery directly involved Arminia. Two players at the club were banned from football for life (<a href="Waldemar%20Slomiany">Waldemar Slomiany</a> and Jürgen Neumann). Arminia was allowed to play the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Bundesliga">1971–72 season</a> in the Bundesliga, but were automatically relegated to the Regionalliga as a penalty. Arminia struggled in the following seasons, but were good enough to be appointed to the newly formed <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in 1974.
After two seasons in mid-table, Arminia had good chances of returning to the Bundesliga in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%202.%20Bundesliga">1976–77</a>, but they finished as runner-up behind <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a>. They faced <a href="TSV%201860%20M%C3%BCnchen">TSV 1860 München</a> in a two-legged play-off whose winner would win promotion to the top flight. Arminia won the first match at home 4–0, but lost the second leg in Munich 0–4. A third match had to be played in <a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main">Frankfurt</a>, which Munich won 2–0.
The team was shocked but bounced back to win promotion in <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%202.%20Bundesliga">1977–78</a>. Arminia started well and on 10 March 1979, they won 4–0 at <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. However, Arminia were hit by a slump and were relegated again. The club kept the team together and bounced back after a record-breaking <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%202.%20Bundesliga">1979–80 season</a>. They won 30 of 38 matches, scored 120 goals, had a 28 match unbeaten streak and set a league record by beating <a href="Arminia%20Hannover">Arminia Hannover</a> 11–0.
Five consecutive seasons in Bundesliga and decline (1980–1993).
Arminia had difficulty avoiding relegation, but stayed in the Bundesliga for five years, a period which included two eighth-place finishes at the end of the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Bundesliga">1982–83</a> and <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Bundesliga">1983–84</a> seasons. Furthermore, Arminia took part in the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a> three times.
An ugly event shocked Germany when <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> defender <a href="Norbert%20Siegmann">Norbert Siegmann</a> slashed <a href="Ewald%20Lienen">Ewald Lienen</a>'s right <a href="thigh">thigh</a> during a match. Success on the pitch did not prevent the club from suffering declining attendances, which enlarged the financial problems. In <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Bundesliga">1984–85</a>, Arminia finished third from the bottom, and lost the relegation play-offs against <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a>.
The team did not gain promotion and in the fall of 1987, Arminia had debts of 4.5 million <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">Marks</a>. The result was a last place finish in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%202.%20Bundesliga">1987–88</a>. <a href="Ernst%20Middendorp">Ernst Middendorp</a> became the new manager and assembled a young team for the new season. Arminia led the way in the <a href="Oberliga%20Westfalen">Oberliga Westfalen</a>, but finished in second position in 1988–89. They won the Oberliga a year later, but the promotion play-offs against <a href="VfB%20Oldenburg">VfB Oldenburg</a> and <a href="TSV%20Havelse">TSV Havelse</a> did not got their way. Four dismal seasons followed, in which the team started well, but were unable to compete for the championship. In 1991, Arminia won the Westphalian Cup, a cup for Westphalian amateur teams, and beat <a href="FSV%20Mainz%2005">FSV Mainz 05</a> in the first round of the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>.
Resurgence and years as a yo-yo-team (1994–2004).
In the spring of 1994, Arminia created a relatively large media buzz by signing veteran Bundesliga players like <a href="Thomas%20von%20Heesen">Thomas von Heesen</a>, <a href="Armin%20Eck">Armin Eck</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Walter%20%281980s%20footballer%29">Fritz Walter</a>. Arminia struggled at first but went on to become champions of the newly formed <a href="Regionalliga%20West/S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga West/Südwest</a> and runners-up in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%202.%20Bundesliga">1995–96 2. Bundesliga</a>. Arminia signed <a href="Stefan%20Kuntz">Stefan Kuntz</a> for the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Bundesliga">1996–97 Bundesliga season</a>, their first in 11 years and finished in 14th position.
The club wrote German football history by signing Iranian players <a href="Ali%20Daei">Ali Daei</a> and <a href="Karim%20Bagheri">Karim Bagheri</a> along with the <a href="SK%20Brann">SK Brann</a> icon <a href="Geirmund%20Brendes%C3%A6ter">Geirmund Brendesæter</a>, who enjoyed a brief spell with the club in 1997. However, after a poor run after the winter break, Arminia were relegated shortly after Brendesæter had left the club. They bounced back by winning the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%202.%20Bundesliga">1998–99 season</a>. <a href="Bruno%20Labbadia">Bruno Labbadia</a> became the league's top scorer with 28 goals. The club suffered from financial problems and entered the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Bundesliga">1999–2000 season</a> with a smaller budget. Relegation followed again after the team became the third team in Bundesliga history to lose ten matches in a row.
Arminia struggled against relegation again the next season and avoided to drop into the Regionalliga in close season. Their fortunes turned around and Arminia won their sixth promotion to the Bundesliga in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%202.%20Bundesliga">2001–02</a>, with <a href="Artur%20Wichniarek">Artur Wichniarek</a> scoring 18 goals. Arminia were almost saved the next year, but a slump with only two points out of the last six matches sealed relegation again.
Once again: Five consecutive seasons in Bundesliga and decline (2004–2011).
The team bounced back again in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%202.%20Bundesliga">2003–04</a>, after Ghanaian striker <a href="Isaac%20Boakye">Isaac Boakye</a> scored 14 goals in his debut season to end as the club's top goalscorer and help them go back to the Bundesliga. They stayed in the top flight until 2009. In <a href="2004-05%20Bundesliga">2004–05</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Owomoyela">Patrick Owomoyela</a> became Arminia's new record national player. <a href="Delron%20Buckley">Delron Buckley</a> scored 15 goals in the Bundesliga matches but left after the season, too. In the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, Arminia reached the semi-finals in 2005 and 2006. In both seasons, Arminia also kept away from the relegation zone virtually the whole time (except the season's beginnings). In those years the image campaign "Aktion 5000 +" let the number of members rise above 10,000. In 2007, many Arminia fans were sad to see the old East Stand being torn down (then the last non-seater stand in the Bundesliga not being placed behind one of the goals) and also further marketing attempts alienated the fans from the Club's Management Board. 
Season by season, important players of the 2004–05 and the <a href="2004-05%20Bundesliga">2005–06</a> season left (some of them after a decline in their own performance): <a href="Fatmir%20Vata">Fatmir Vata</a> and <a href="Heiko%20Westermann">Heiko Westermann</a> in 2007, <a href="Mathias%20Hain">Mathias Hain</a>, <a href="Sibusiso%20Zuma">Sibusiso Zuma</a> and <a href="Petr%20Gabriel">Petr Gabriel</a> in 2008. From 2007 onwards, managerial sackings became more and more common and avoiding relegation became more and more difficult. 
The <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07 season</a> was the first one in which Arminia was already close to relegation but after having won four matches from the 30th to the 33rd matchday being coached by <a href="Ernst%20Middendorp">Ernst Middendorp</a>, they finished it even better than the two previous ones. In the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a>, even though it began very well, they gathered only 34 points and avoided relegation merely because <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> lost at home during Arminia's draw against <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> on the last matchday. But Arminia finished the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Bundesliga">2008–09 season</a> last and were relegated to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%202.%20Bundesliga">2009–10</a> season important players of former seasons like <a href="R%C3%BCdiger%20Kauf">Rüdiger Kauf</a>, <a href="Dennis%20Eilhoff">Dennis Eilhoff</a>, <a href="Jonas%20Kamper">Jonas Kamper</a> and <a href="Radim%20Ku%C4%8Dera">Radim Kučera</a> were still part of the squad. On 16 March 2010, the <a href="Die%20Liga%20%E2%80%93%20Fu%C3%9Fballverband">DFL</a> deducted four points from Arminia for breaches of the licensing regulations. This greatly reduced their chances of promotion. The financial situation worsened, especially as costs for constructing the East Stand had proven to be much higher than originally planned for in 2007. They finished the season 7th and many important players left the club. The coach, the managing director and the club's president were replaced in the summer break. Nevertheless, the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%202.%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a> started very bad, so that in November, the coach <a href="Christian%20Ziege">Christian Ziege</a> war replaced by club legend <a href="Ewald%20Lienen">Ewald Lienen</a>. However, in spite of signing several new players during the rest of the season, they picked up only 16 points and won only four games, so that they ended the season on the last rank and were relegated to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>. Even more players left.
3. Liga, interrupted once (2011–2015).
A new team had to be formed with players formerly unknown in Bielefeld who would leave their mark on the following seasons: <a href="Patrick%20Platins">Patrick Platins</a>, <a href="Manuel%20Hornig">Manuel Hornig</a>, <a href="Tom%20Sch%C3%BCtz">Tom Schütz</a>, <a href="Sebastian%20Hille">Sebastian Hille</a>, <a href="Thomas%20H%C3%BCbener">Thomas Hübener</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Sch%C3%B6nfeld">Patrick Schönfeld</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Rahn">Johannes Rahn</a> and from the second half of the season onwards especially <a href="Fabian%20Klos">Fabian Klos</a> who would coin a whole era. Another formative player, <a href="Stefan%20Ortega%20Moreno">Stefan Ortega Moreno</a>, joined from the club's youth. After a poor start, they ended the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%203.%20Liga">2011–12</a> season in 13th place. They also won the <a href="Westphalia%20Cup">Westphalia Cup</a>, in a final against arch rival <a href="SC%20Preu%C3%9Fen%20M%C3%BCnster">SC Preußen Münster</a>. By reaching the final, they also qualified for the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20DFB-Pokal">2012–13 DFB-Pokal</a>, where they beat <a href="SC%20Paderborn%2007">SC Paderborn 07</a>, a team playing in the 2. Bundesliga, but lost in the second round in a close match against <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer 04 Leverkusen</a>, a Europa League participant. On 11 May 2013, Bielefeld beat <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a> 1–0 to guarantee a top two finish and promotion back to the 2. Bundesliga for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%202.%20Bundesliga">2013–14</a> season. 
That season began quite hopeful: Arminia qualified for the second round of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> again and at the 8th matchday they had even climbed up to the 3rd rank in the league table. But after a disastrous autumn and a mediocre winter Arminia fell down onto the 17th rank and the popular coach <a href="Stefan%20Kr%C3%A4mer">Stefan Krämer</a> – the first manager having held office for more than two years since 2004 – had to leave. His successor <a href="Norbert%20Meier">Norbert Meier</a> at first had only little more success: Arminia finished 16th in the 2. Bundesliga, and lost a playoff against <a href="SV%20Darmstadt%2098">SV Darmstadt 98</a> on away goals after a 122nd minute (extra time) goal gave Darmstadt the victory. Arminia had to go back into the 3. Liga.
But the next season could wipe out the bitterness of that disaster: In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20DFB-Pokal">2014–15 DFB-Pokal</a>, as a <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> club, Arminia reached the semi-finals by defeating three <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> teams (<a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>, <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">SV Werder Bremen</a> and <a href="VfL%20Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">VfL Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>). They also were the top team in the 3. Liga (after a bad beginning with only four points from the first four matches) for most part of the season. After the loss against <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> in the semi-final of the DFB-Pokal, Arminia seemed to have lost their ability to win their matches in the 3. Liga as well. Even the qualification for the 2. Bundesliga seemed to become doubtful, but was secured after a 2–2 draw against <a href="SSV%20Jahn%20Regensburg">SSV Jahn Regensburg</a>, the last team in the league table, at the 37th matchday. Liberated from the pressure of a possible non-qualification, they also won the 3. Liga with a final 1–0 victory at the last matchday.
Five consecutive seasons in 2. Bundesliga / financial consolidation (2015–2020).
A stable season with a defeat in the first round of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, a lot of draws in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%202.%20Bundesliga">league</a> (especially in the beginning: eight out of ten matches; in the end Arminia reached a record of 18) and only very few goals scored at home (only eight until the 30th matchday) followed so that the 4–2 over <a href="Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">Greuther Fürth</a> at the 31st matchday which secured Arminia's staying up was only Arminia's third win at home. That season's highlights probably were the draws against all three top teams away. In the league table Arminia never went deeper than rank 14 and finished 12th.
After the season, the coach <a href="Norbert%20Meier">Norbert Meier</a> was bought by <a href="SV%20Darmstadt%2098">SV Darmstadt 98</a>. A difficult <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%202.%20Bundesliga">2016–17 season</a> with two manager sackings followed. Arminia found themselves among the lowest four teams in the league table from the fourth matchday onwards, mostly on the 16th or 17th rank. On the other hand, Arminia reached the quarter-final in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. They avoided relegation as they finished in 15th after a 6–0 win over promotion candidate <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a> and a 1–1 against <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden">Dynamo Dresden</a> at the last two matchdays.
The <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%202.%20Bundesliga">2017–18 season</a> turned out easier. Having gathered 10 points out of the first four matches, Arminia hardly ever left the upper half of the league table (only at the 19th matchday: rank 10) and finished on the 4th rank – though in that season's very close league table this never meant much. In that season, Arminia also made a big step in lowering its debts through an alliance of sponsors and <a href="Fabian%20Klos">Fabian Klos</a> replaced Ernst Kuster as the club's all-time top scorer.
In November 2018, Arminia were practically free of debt but had to sell its stadium. The team faced a more difficult situation when December started: Having gained less than one point per match on average, only the weakness of the competing relegation candidates kept them up and they were already out of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> after a 0–3 defeat at home against <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a> – another relegation candidate – in the second round. Thus, the popular coach <a href="Jeff%20Saibene">Jeff Saibene</a> was replaced by <a href="Uwe%20Neuhaus">Uwe Neuhaus</a>, who managed Arminia back into mid table within four matchdays and into 7th place by the last matchday.
The <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%202.%20Bundesliga">2019–20 season</a> would turn out even better. When Arminia had climbed on the 3rd rank of the league table after a 2–0 victory away against <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a> – who were originally regarded as a promotion candidate – at the 6th matchday, hardly anyone guessed they would stay in the promotion area of the league table for the rest of the season. They had just reached the second rank of the league table when they met <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">FC Schalke 04</a> in the 2nd round of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> on 29 October. In spite of Schalke clearly dominating the match in the first 70 minutes, Arminia thrilled the supporters in the last 20 minutes by scoring two goals and only closely missing extra time. They finished the 15th matchday on 1 December on the first rank of the league table where they would stay for the rest of the season in spite of competing with <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> and <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> who were originally estimated as main promotion candidates. After Arminia's 1–1 draw in Stuttgart on 9 March 2020 (25th matchday) the season was interrupted because of the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Even this interruption did not affect them: they finished the season with 68 points – 10 points more than VfB Stuttgart who finished 2nd.
The 2020s.
In the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Arminia%20Bielefeld%20season">2020–21 season</a>, they were the team with the lowest budget in the Bundesliga. After a defeat in the first round of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> they had a quite promising start in the Bundesliga season, but from the 4th matchday onwards they could be found among the last five teams in the league table, from the 6th matchday onwards amongst the last four teams. In March, the popular manager <a href="Uwe%20Neuhaus">Uwe Neuhaus</a> was replaced by <a href="Frank%20Kramer%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201972%29">Frank Kramer</a>. A 2–0 win over <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> on the final matchday secured their spot in the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Arminia%20Bielefeld%20season">2021–22 Bundesliga</a>. 
That season turned out even more difficult. At the end of October they were in danger of losing touch to the 16th rank. They started November with 1–0 win away over <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>, their first win in the whole Bundesliga season. That match appeared to have stabilised Arminia's performance. In February they climbed up to 14th after a 1–0 win over <a href="1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">1. FC Union Berlin</a>. However, this would be their last win of the season. They ended in 17th place and were relegated to the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%202.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>.
Colours and crest.
Arminia took the club colours blue, white and black upon their foundation in 1905. The colours have not changed, though the current club colours are black, white and blue. Despite this, Arminia played their first match in an orange <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a>. Arminia's home kit was blue for most of the time, while their shorts and socks were white. The team that won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1970 wore a blue shirt with thick white stripes. The away kit was mostly all white, while green shirts were worn in the 1990s.
The crest consists of a flag with the club's colours black, white and blue from left to right. The white part of the <a href="flag">flag</a> includes the letter A for Arminia. The flag is surrounded by a <a href="wreath">wreath</a> of <a href="oak">oak</a>.
Stadium.
Arminia played their first home matches at the "Kesselbrink" in downtown Bielefeld. They moved to a new ground at the "Kaiserstraße" (today: "August-Bebel-Straße") in 1907, and to the "Pottenau" in 1910. In 1926, Arminia <a href="lease">lease</a>d a ground from a farmer named Lohmann. The ground did not look like a football pitch. The club member Heinrich Pahl said that the area looks like an Alm (German for "<a href="Alps">alpine</a> <a href="grassland">grassland</a>"). The stadium was known as the Alm. Arminia played its first match against <a href="Victoria%20Hamburg">Victoria Hamburg</a> on 1 May 1926. The first grandstands were constructed in 1954. When Arminia won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1970, the Alm underwent a general development. A main stand with seats was built and the northern and eastern stands were enlarged. The Alm had a capacity of 30,000 and <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">floodlight</a>s were installed. In 1978, a roof was added to the main stands and the other stands were enlarged again. The stadium had a capacity of 35,000 then.
When Arminia was relegated to the Oberliga in 1988, the northern and the southern stand were torn down because both stands did not match the new safety regulations. The eastern stand was also made smaller and a roof was added. The capacity was reduced to about 15,000. After Arminia won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1996, the main and northern stands were demolished and completely rebuilt. The same happened to the south stand in 1999. In 2004, Arminia signed a sponsorship deal with Schüco and the stadium was named "SchücoArena". The latest redevelopment saw the Eastern Stand being rebuilt in 2008.
The Bielefelder Alm has a capacity of 27,300, including 20,381 seats. Bielefelder Alm was a candidate to host matches of the <a href="2011%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2011 FIFA Women's World Cup</a>.
Supporters.
Arminia have a large number of loyal supporters. Even in 2011–12, Arminia had an average attendance of 8,930, which was the highest in the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>. In 2014–15, Arminia had an average attendance of 14,540, which was the second highest in that 3. Liga season. The numbers also show the risen popularity of the 3. Liga. Arminia's matches during the 2013–14 2. Bundesliga were attended by 16,890 on average. These numbers only count league matches. Arminia's matches in the 2014–15 DFB-Pokal were attended by 21,763 on average. The core of the fans can be found on the terraces of the Southern Stand.
Arminia's fans come primarily from the <a href="Ostwestfalen-Lippe">Ostwestfalen-Lippe</a> region with a <a href="Catchment%20area%20%28human%20geography%29">catchment area</a> of about 100 kilometers around Bielefeld. There are around 140 fanclubs, mostly from Ostwestfalen-Lippe. However, there are fanclubs in Berlin, <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, London, Birmingham, Taunton, Austria and the Netherlands.
There is a traditional rivalry with <a href="SC%20Preu%C3%9Fen%20M%C3%BCnster">SC Preußen Münster</a>. The match against them in March 2012, which was the first one taking place in Bielefeld after nearly 20 years, was attended by 21,203 spectators. No other match in the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> had such a high attendance. One year later, the stadium was nearly sold out in that derby. An earlier rival was VfB 03 Bielefeld from the east of Bielefeld, but the rivalry lessened, and, nowadays, friendly matches between Arminia and <a href="VfB%20Fichte%20Bielefeld">VfB Fichte Bielefeld</a>, as the club nowadays is called, take place every year. Another rival is <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a>, especially since the late 90s, and there were "fashion rivalries" with other clubs from the <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr</a>, because that area also belongs to Westphalia. Some <a href="SC%20Paderborn%2007">SC Paderborn 07</a> supporters seem to consider Arminia as their main rival, but Arminia fans are unlikely to feel the same about them. Also the matches against <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a> are a small derby (somehow oscillating between friendship and rivalry). There are friendly relations to the supporters of the <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>, with both clubs sharing the same colours (black, white and blue), resulting in the chant "Schwarz, weiß, blau – Arminia und der HSV" ("Black, white, blue – Arminia and HSV") among supporters of both clubs. For many fans this friendship also involves friendly ties to <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a>, whose fans share a friendship with Hamburg as well. All three clubs are sometimes dubbed the "Nordallianz" ("Northern Alliance"), despite the fact that Bielefeld (other than Hamburg and Hannover) is not located in what is considered Northern Germany.
100 Year Team.
To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the club's formation, a fan poll was taken to determine the club's greatest starting XI, as well as seven substitutes and a manager. The following players were chosen:

1. FC Heidenheim

1. FC Heidenheim 1846, commonly known as FC Heidenheim or just Heidenheim, is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German professional association football club</a> from the city of <a href="Heidenheim%20an%20der%20Brenz">Heidenheim</a>, <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>. Since the 2023–24 season they play in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, the top tier in the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>.
History.
The club was formed in the year of 2007 through the separation of the football section from parent association Heidenheimer Sportbund, a larger sports club that has 5,800 members in 27 departments. The independence of the football side allows it to operate under the stricter economic standards set for professional clubs which are members of the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (Deutscher Fußball-Bund or DFB).
Heidenheimer SB itself was founded through the 1972 merger of TSB Heidenheim and VfL Heidenheim. The club's origins go back to 14 August 1846, with the establishment of the gymnastics club Turngemeinde Heidenheim, which folded in 1852, but was re-constituted under the same name in 1861. The club was renamed Turnverein Heidenheim in 1872.
A football department was created within the association on 8 July 1890 and became an independent side known as VfR Heidenheim on 21 August 1922. The swimming club Schwimmverein 04 Heidenheim joined VfR in 1936 to form VfL Heidenheim 04. In 1949, following World War II, these two clubs went their separate ways, the swimmers under their original name, and the footballers as VfL Heidenheim 1890.
In the meantime, parent club TV 1846 Heidenheim was joined on 13 July 1935 by SpVgg Heidenheim and then on 3 April 1937 merged with 1. Sportverein 1900 Heidenheim – which was known as Athletenklub Hellenstein until 1920 – to become TSV 1846 Heidenheim. After the war TSV was united with Turnerbund Heidenheim 1902 whose history was as a worker's club. TB was established on 21 December 1902 and was renamed Turnerbund Heidenheim on 6 August 1904. This club merged with Arbeiterturnverein 1904 Heidenheim on 8 March 1919. Like other worker's clubs, TB was considered as politically unreliable by the <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> regime and was dissolved in 1933. It was re-established after the war and on 3 February 1946 joined TSV 1846 Heidenheim to form TSB 1846 Heidenheim.
The 27 May 1972 merger of TSB and VfL brought all these threads together, returning the footballers to the fold of the original gymnastics club. Heidenheimer SB and predecessor VfL Heidenheim played in the <a href="Amateurliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Amateurliga Württemberg</a> (III) from 1963 to 1975 and again from 1976 to 1979. Regional cup wins led to the team's participation in the opening round of the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> (German Cup) in 1975, 1978, and 1980, before the side slipped into lower level competition.
The club has since recovered and in 2004 advanced to the <a href="Oberliga%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Oberliga Baden-Württemberg</a>. In 2007, the football department decided to split off from Heidenheimer SB as a legally independent club with retrospective effect from January 1, 2007. A successful season finish in 2008 saw the club being promoted to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>. Having simultaneously won the <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg%20Cup">Württemberg Cup</a>, Heidenheim was allowed to participate in the first round of the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> in the following season, where the team lost 0–3 to <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a>. In 2009, Heidenheim finished first in the Regionalliga Süd and got promoted to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>.
After five seasons in the 3. Liga with the club always finishing in the upper half of the table, 1. FC Heidenheim won the league in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%203.%20Liga">2013–14</a>, and earned promotion to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> for the first time. At the same time the club, however, withdrew its reserve team, playing in the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg, from competition after such teams ceased to be compulsory for professional clubs.
In the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%202.%20Bundesliga">2019–20</a> season, 1. FC Heidenheim finished third to play against the 16th-placed Bundesliga club, <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>, in the <a href="Promotion%20to%20the%20Bundesliga">promotion-relegation play-offs</a>. The tie ended in a 2–2 draw on aggregate, as 1. FC Heidenheim lost on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a> to stay in 2. Bundesliga.
On the final matchday of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%202.%20Bundesliga">2022–23</a> season, 1. FC Heidenheim managed to score two goals in the stoppage time to win 3–2 against <a href="SSV%20Jahn%20Regensburg">Jahn Regensburg</a>, in which they finished top of the table ahead of <a href="SV%20Darmstadt%2098">Darmstadt</a> on goal difference and promoted to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> for the first time in their history. On 17 September 2023, the club won their first ever Bundesliga match, in a 4–2 home victory against Werder Bremen, on the same day that head coach, <a href="Frank%20Schmidt%20%28footballer%29">Frank Schmidt</a>, set the record as the longest serving manager in the history of German football.

History.
Early history.
The club traces its origins to a pair of clubs founded in 1904: Freiburger Fußballverein 04 was organised in March of that year; FC Schwalbe Freiburg just two months later. Both clubs underwent name changes, with Schwalbe becoming FC Mars in 1905, Mars becoming Union Freiburg in 1906, and FV 04 Freiburg becoming Sportverein Freiburg 04 in 1909. Three years later, SV and Union formed Sportclub Freiburg, at the same time incorporating the <a href="griffin">griffin</a> head.
In 1918, after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, SC Freiburg entered a temporary arrangement with Freiburger FC to be able to field a full side called KSG Freiburg. The next year, SC Freiburg associated themselves with <a href="Freiburger%20Turnerschaft%20von%201844">FT 1844 Freiburg</a> as that club's football department, until 1928 when they left to enter into a stadium-sharing arrangement with PSV (Polizeisportverein) Freiburg 1924 that lasted until 1930 and the failure of PSV. SC Freiburg then started again with FT 1844 Freiburg in 1938. The club played first in the "<a href="Bezirksliga%20Baden">Bezirksliga Baden</a>" in 1928, then in the "<a href="Gauliga%20Baden">Gauliga Baden</a>", from which they were relegated in 1934.
At the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="Allied-occupied%20Germany">Allied occupation</a> authorities disbanded most existing organizations in Germany, including football and sports clubs. The clubs reconstituted themselves after about a year, but were required to take on new names in an attempt to disassociate them from Nazis. SC Freiburg was therefore briefly known as VfL Freiburg. By 1950, French-occupation authorities allowed the clubs to reclaim their old identities. Finally, in 1952, SC Freiburg left FT Freiburg behind again.
Through the 1930s, SC Freiburg played in the Bezirkliga (II), in the Gauliga Baden (I), winning local titles. After World War II, they resumed playing in the <a href="Amateurliga%20S%C3%BCdbaden">Amateurliga Südbaden</a> (III).
The Finke era with ten Bundesliga seasons (1991–2007).
SC Freiburg were promoted to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%202.%20Bundesliga">1978–79</a>, which they would compete in for a decade-and-a-half before making the breakthrough to the top-flight <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Bundesliga">1993–94</a> under the management of <a href="Volker%20Finke">Volker Finke</a>. In their first Bundesliga season, Freiburg narrowly avoided relegation. They made a third place finish in their <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Bundesliga">second season</a> at the top level, finishing third, just three points behind champions <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. It was at this time that they were first nicknamed "Breisgau-Brasilianer" (literally "Breisgau-Brazilians"), due to their attractive style of play.
The club's reached the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Cup">1995</a> and <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Cup">2001</a>.
Freiburg's first Bundesliga relegation was in 1997 after they finished in 17th position. While they have been relegated four times since first making the Bundesliga, they have thrice won immediate promotion back to the top league. It was the first time since 1992 that Freiburg played in the 2. Bundesliga for two consecutive seasons.
Freiburg finished the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%202.%20Bundesliga">2006–07 season</a> in fourth place in the 2. Bundesliga, missing out on the third automatic-promotion spot on goal difference to <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a>, although they won 12 of their last 16 league games. They were knocked out of the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> in the second round by <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> on 24 October 2006.
On 20 May 2007, <a href="Volker%20Finke">Volker Finke</a> resigned as the club's coach after 16 years in the job. He was succeeded by <a href="Robin%20Dutt">Robin Dutt</a>, who himself left the club for <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> in 2011.
On 10 May 2009, Freiburg secured promotion into the Bundesliga once again, beating <a href="TuS%20Koblenz">TuS Koblenz</a> in an away game 5–2.
Streich era.
In the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Bundesliga">2011–12 season</a>, a coaching change by appointing <a href="Christian%20Streich">Christian Streich</a>, with the club finishing 12th. Under Christian Streich, the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13 Bundesliga season</a> saw the club finish in fifth place, their best league standing since 1994–95. The fifth-place finish secured a position in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2013–14 UEFA Europa League</a>. Had Freiburg defeated <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> on the final matchday of the season, Freiburg would have advanced further in the league table against Schalke and qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the first time in club history. The 1–2 defeat to Schalke, however, saw Schalke secure fourth place in the league and qualify for the tournament instead. During the 2012–13 season, Freiburg also advanced to the semi-finals of the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> for the first time in the club's history, but lost to local rivals <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> 1–2, and missed the chance to play <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the <a href="2013%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">final</a>.
In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15 season</a>, after six years in the top flight, Freiburg was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga by a single point after a final-day defeat at <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a>. This was despite beating <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the second-last game. In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%202.%20Bundesliga">following season</a>, however, the club earned its fifth promotion to the Bundesliga, with two matches to spare. The first season back in the Bundesliga saw them end seventh. This saw Freiburg qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>, as German cupwinners Borussia Dortmund were already qualified for the Champions League. The side were eliminated in the third qualification round against <a href="NK%20Dom%C5%BEale">NK Domžale</a> from Slovenia. Freiburg stayed in the top flight, finishing 15th.
In the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Bundesliga">2021–22 season</a>, Freiburg finished sixth in the league to qualify to the next season's <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>, where they reached the round of 16. In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Bundesliga">following season</a>, they finished fifth in the league to achieve another direct qualification to the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%23Group%20stage">Europa League group stage</a>, despite being in the Champions League spots most of the season; however, two consecutive losses against rivals <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> and <a href="1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">Union Berlin</a> had them drop down in the league table with two games remaining. In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> of the same season, defeated Bayern Munich 2–1 in the quarter-finals, in an away match for the first time in their history, before losing in the semi-finals at home 1–5 to RB Leipzig.
Reserve team.
The club's reserve team, formerly the SC Freiburg Amateure, now <a href="SC%20Freiburg%20II">SC Freiburg II</a>, has, for the most part of its history played in the lower amateur leagues. It made a three-season appearance in the tier four <a href="Verbandsliga%20S%C3%BCdbaden">Verbandsliga Südbaden</a> from 1983 to 1986, but then took until 1994 to return to this league. In 1998 the team won promotion to the <a href="Oberliga%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Oberliga Baden-Württemberg</a> after a league championship in the Verbandsliga. Freiburg II spent the next ten seasons at this level as an upper table side before another league championship took the team to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>. After four seasons at this league the team became part of the new <a href="Fu%C3%9Fball-Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga Südwest</a> in 2012. After a seventh place in its first season in the league the team finished runner-up in 2013–14.
A <a href="South%20Baden%20Cup">South Baden Cup</a> win in 2001 qualified it for the first round of the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20DFB-Pokal">2001–02 DFB-Pokal</a>, the German Cup, where it lost to Schalke 04.
Stadium.
SC Freiburg formerly played its home games at the <a href="Dreisamstadion">Dreisamstadion</a>, named after the <a href="Dreisam">Dreisam</a> River which flows through Freiburg. Because of sponsorship agreements, the stadium was known as the Schwarzwald-Stadion. The stadium has an approximate capacity of 24,000 spectators, and was built in 1953. Forty years later, then manager <a href="Volker%20Finke">Volker Finke</a> began an initiative to transform the Dreisamstadion into Germany's first <a href="solar%20power">solar power</a>ed football stadium. There are solar modules on the north, south, and main tribunes. These panels generate 250,000 <a href="kWh">kWh</a> of energy per year.
The new <a href="Europa-Park%20Stadion">Europa-Park Stadion</a> designed by <a href="HPP%20Architekten">HPP Architekten</a>, was completed in October 2021. Located in the west of the city in a part of the city called Brühl — immediately to the west of <a href="Freiburg%20Airport">Freiburg Airport</a> — it has a capacity of 34,700.
Sponsorship.
In April 2022, the team announced their sponsorship with car retailer <a href="Cazoo">Cazoo</a> starting in July 2022. The Cazoo brand is visible on the front of the new jerseys as the team's main sponsor. In addition to the Bundesliga professionals, Cazoo appeared as shirt sponsor and advertising partner of the second team of SC Freiburg in the third division and as co-sponsor of the Freiburg Football School, and became visible at all matches of the SC junior teams. Cazoo also became a co-sponsor and sleeve sponsor of SC Freiburg's Bundesliga women.

A failed attempt to start a football club in the city in 1903 was followed up two years later by the successful creation of 1. Mainzer Fussballclub Hassia 1905. After a number of years of play in the Süddeutschen Fußballverband (South German Football League), the club merged with FC Hermannia 07 – the former football side of Mainzer TV 1817 – to form 1. Mainzer Fussballverein Hassia 05, which dropped "Hassia" from its name in August 1912. Another merger after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, in 1919, with Sportverein 1908 Mainz, resulted in the formation of 1. Mainzer Fußball- und Sportverein 05. "Die Nullfünfer" ("05") was a solid club that earned several regional league championships in the period between the wars and qualified for the opening round of the national championships in 1921, after winning the <a href="Kreisliga%20Hessen">Kreisliga Hessen</a>.
Play during the Nazi era.
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the club earned decent results in the <a href="Bezirksliga%20Main-Hessen">Bezirksliga Main-Hessen</a> – Gruppe Hessen, including first-place finishes in 1932 and 1933. This merited the team a place in the <a href="Gauliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Gauliga Südwest</a>, one of 16 new first-division leagues formed in the re-organization of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>. The club played only a single season at that level before being relegated, due to the high intensity play that they were unable to keep up with. Karl Scherm scored in 23 out of 44 matches with Mainz during his last season. In 1938, Mainz was forced into a merger with Reichsbahn SV Mainz and played as Reichsbahn SV Mainz 05 until the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.
Long march to the Bundesliga.
After World War II, the club again joined the upper ranks of league play in Germany's <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCdwest%20%281945-63%29">Oberliga Südwest</a>, but were never better than a mid-table side. It played in the top flight until the founding of the new professional league, the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, in 1963 and would go on to play as a second division side for most of the next four decades. They withdrew for a time – from the late 1970s into the late 1980s – to the Amateur <a href="Fu%C3%9Fball-Oberliga%20Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar">Oberliga Südwest</a> (III), as the result of a series of financial problems. "Mainz" earned honours as the German amateur champions in 1982.
The club returned to professional play with promotion to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> for a single season in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%202.%20Bundesliga">1988–89</a> with Bodo Hertlein as president, before finally returning for an extended run in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%202.%20Bundesliga">1990–91</a>. Initially, they were perennial relegation candidates, struggling hard each season to avoid being sent down. However, under unorthodox trainer <a href="Wolfgang%20Frank">Wolfgang Frank</a>, Mainz became one of the first clubs in German football to adopt a flat four zone defence, as opposed to the then-popular man-to-man defence using a "<a href="Libero%20%28football%29">libero</a>".
Mainz had three unsuccessful attempts to get to the top flight in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%202.%20Bundesliga">1996–97</a>, <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%202.%20Bundesliga">2001–02</a>, and <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%202.%20Bundesliga">2002–03</a>, with close fourth-place finishes just out of the promotion zone. The last of those attempts stung as they were denied promotion in the 93rd minute of the last match of the season. One year earlier, Mainz became the best non-promoted team of all-time in the 2. Bundesliga, with 64 points accumulated. However, the club's persistence paid dividends after promotion to the Bundesliga in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%202.%20Bundesliga">2003–04</a> under head coach <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a>. The club played three seasons in the top flight, but were relegated at the end of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07 season</a>. Mainz secured promotion to the top flight again two years later, after the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%202.%20Bundesliga">2008–09 season</a>.
Mainz also earned a spot in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">2005–06 UEFA Cup</a> in their debut Bundesliga season as Germany's nominee in the <a href="UEFA%20Respect%20Fair%20Play%20ranking">Fair Play</a> draw which acknowledges positive play, respect for one's opponent, respect for the referee, the behaviour of the crowd and of team officials, as well as cautions and dismissals. Due to the Bruchweg stadium's limited capacity, the home matches in UEFA Cup were played in <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>'s <a href="Commerzbank-Arena">Commerzbank-Arena</a>. After defeating Armenian club <a href="FC%20Mika">Mika</a> and Icelandic club <a href="Keflav%C3%ADk%20%C3%8DF">Keflavík</a> in the qualifying rounds, Mainz lost to eventual champions <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> 2–0 on aggregate in the first round.
In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a>, Mainz equalled the Bundesliga starting record by winning their first seven matches that season. They ended the season with their best finish to date in fifth place, good enough to secure them their second entry to the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>, where they were eliminated in the third qualifying round by Romanian club <a href="CS%20Gaz%20Metan%20Media%C8%99">Gaz Metan Mediaș</a>.

They were founded on 12 April 1953 as a club affiliated with the East German <a href="Volkspolizei">police</a> and became one of the most popular and successful clubs in <a href="East%20German%20football%20league%20system">East German football</a>, winning eight <a href="East%20German%20football%20champions">league titles</a>.
After the <a href="German%20reunification">reunification of Germany</a>, Dynamo played four seasons in the top division, <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, from 1991 to 1995, but have since drifted between the second and fourth tiers.

Although the club's badge is predominantly red, they use gold and black as their home colours, derived from the official city flag and coat of arms of the city of Dresden.
History.
Early years (1950–1954).
The city of <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> played a significant part in German football before and during World War II. Local football team <a href="Dresdner%20SC">Dresdner SC</a> won the <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">national championships</a> in 1943 and 1944. The <a href="Allied%20occupation%20of%20Germany">occupying Allied authorities</a> dissolved organizations across Germany, including sports clubs like Dresdner SC, after the war as part of the process of <a href="denazification">denazification</a>. Dresdner SC was reestablished in 1946 as <a href="Friedrichstadt%20%28Dresden%29">SG Friedrichstadt</a>. However, the eastern part of Germany, including Dresden, was under Soviet control, and the sports club was considered too <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> by authorities.
SG Friedrichstadt met <a href="FSV%20Zwickau">ZSG Horst Zwickau</a> at the <a href="Heinz-Steyer-Stadion">Heinz-Steyer-Stadion</a> in Dresden on 16 April 1950. The match would practically decide which of the two teams that would win the East German championship in the <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20DDR-Oberliga">1949–50 season</a>. The match was attended by 60,000 spectators at the Heinz-Steyer-Stadion. Also the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED First Secretary</a> <a href="Walter%20Ulbricht">Walter Ulbricht</a> and his entourage were present. ZSG Horch Zwickau had been founded only one year earlier and embodied the form of organization that the SED and the state leadership wanted to promote for the sports movement they propagated. ZSG Horch Zwickau won the match 1–5 and became East German champions. The match was characterized by a very physical play from ZSG Horch Zwickau and several controversial referee decisions in favor of ZSG Horch Zwickau. The players of SG Friedrichstadt left the pitch without greeting their opponents and thousands of angry Dresden spectators invaded the pitch. East German sports authorities took these events as a pretext to dissolve SG Friedrichstadt and delegate the players to BSG VVB Tabak Dresden.
The city needed a new, ideologically safe representative in the <a href="DDR-Oberliga">DDR-Oberliga</a>. BSG VVB Tabak Dresden was planned to take over the place of SG Friedrichstadt in the DDR-Oberliga. However, most players from the former team of SG Friedrichstadt, including player-coach <a href="Helmut%20Sch%C3%B6n">Helmut Schön</a>, did not agree with the move and left Dresden to join <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> or other clubs under the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German football Association (DFB)</a>. To save the place in the DDR-Oberliga for Dresden, the place was instead given to SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.
SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden played in the lower-tier Stadtliga Dresden at the time of the dissolution of SG Fredrichsstadt.
 SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden was thus able to enter DDR-Oberliga without having to progress through divisions. In order to keep the place in the <a href="DDR-Oberliga">DDR-Oberliga</a>, the team of SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden would be reinforced with players from all over the country.
SV Deutsche Volkzpolizei Dresden was originally founded as SG Volkspolizei Dresden in 1948. The head of the Volkspolizei <a href="Kurt%20Fischer%20%28politician%29">Kurt Fischer</a> ordered the founding of a central <a href="Sports%20associations%20%28East%20Germany%29">sports association</a> for all sports communities of the Volkspolizei around East Germany on 20 June 1950. The new sports association was named SV Deutsche Volkspolizei. SG Volkspolizei Dresden was thus incorporated into the new sports association and renamed SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden. The order from Fischer also contained the passage that the best football players in the sports communities of the Volkspollizei should be concentrated in the now first-tier SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden.
The 40 best players of the various Volkspolizei teams in East Germany were then brought together for a training session in <a href="Forst%20%28Lausitz%29">Forst</a> in July 1950. Coaches and picked out 17 players from 11 different cities who were delegated to Dresden to form the team. <a href="SG%20Volkspolizei%20Potsdam">SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Potsdam</a> lost its five top-performers to Dresden, including <a href="Herbert%20Schoen">Herbert Schoen</a>, <a href="Johannes%20Matzen">Johannes Matzen</a> and <a href="G%C3%BCnter%20Schr%C3%B6ter">Günter Schröter</a>, and was severely weakened. SV Deutsche Volkspolizei Dresden quickly established itself as a force in East German football. The team won its first title in the 1951–52 FDGB-Pokal.
The new sports association SV Dynamo was founded on 27 March 1953. SV Dynamo was formed from SV Deutsche Volkspolizei and the sports communities of the <a href="Stasi">Secretariat of State Security</a>, commonly known as the Stasi. The president of SV Dynamo was <a href="Erich%20Mielke">Erich Mielke</a>, at the time deputy head of the Stasi. SV Deutsche Volkspolizei was incorporated into SV Dynamo and reformed as Dynamo Dresden on 12 April 1953. The official founding date of Dynamo Dresden has since been 12 April 1953. Shortly after this, the club claimed its <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20DDR-Oberliga">first</a> <a href="East%20German%20football%20champions">league title</a>.
However, success proved to be the club's undoing. The team of Dynamo Dresden was relocated to Berlin in November 1954 to play for the new <a href="Sports%20club%20%28East%20Germany%29">sports club</a> <a href="SC%20Dynamo%20Berlin">SC Dynamo Berlin</a> in the DDR-Oberliga. The remainder of Dynamo Dresden was left to regroup in the second-tier <a href="DDR-Liga">DDR-Liga</a>, taking over the place in the DDR-Liga, as well as points and goals, from dissolved SC DHFK Leipzig. Political factors and pressure from Erich Mielke were probably the main reasons behind the relocation of Dynamo Dresden to Berlin. The relocation was meant to provide the capital with a competitive team that could rival <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>, <a href="Blau-Wei%C3%9F%201890%20Berlin">Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin</a> and <a href="Tennis%20Borussia%20Berlin">Tennis Borussia Berlin</a>, which were still popular in East Berlin and drew football fans to West Berlin.
Re-emergence (1954–1969).
Dynamo Dresden were left with a team composed of youth and reserve players, and had dropped to the fourth tier by 1957, playing in the local <a href="Bezirksliga">Bezirksliga</a>. Dynamo Dresden began to climb the divisions, though, and by 1962 they were back in the <a href="DDR-Oberliga">DDR-Oberliga</a>, and although this <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20DDR-Oberliga">first season</a> ended in relegation, they bounced back immediately. They recovered equally well from another relegation in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20DDR-Oberliga">1968</a>, and remained in the Oberliga from <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20DDR-Oberliga">1969</a> until its dissolution in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NOFV-Oberliga">1991</a>. This relegation came after a fourth-place finish in <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20DDR-Oberliga">1967</a>, which enabled Dynamo's first foray into <a href="UEFA">European football</a> – they entered the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1967–68 Fairs Cup</a>, where they were eliminated by Scottish side <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> in the first round.
East German football was reorganized during the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20DDR-Oberliga">1965–66 season</a>. Ten football departments were separated from their sports clubs to create ten dedicated <a href="Football%20club%20%28East%20Germany%29">football clubs</a> () (FC). The best talents in the country were meant to be concentrated in the new dedicated football cubs, with the object to bring stability to the game at the top level and to develop players for <a href="East%20Germany%20national%20football%20team">the national team</a>. It had long been planned to merge Dynamo Dresden with the football department of sports club SC Einheit Dresden, in order concentrate the best footballer in the regional district in one club. This had been done in Leipzig. However, a tug of war developed between Erich Mielke and the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a> First secretary in <a href="Bezirk%20Dresden">Bezirk Dresden</a> <a href="Werner%20Krolikowski">Werner Krolikowski</a>. Erich Mielke did not want to give up Dynamo Dresden, while Krolikowski advocated for the establishment of a civil football club. The stalemate continued for one and a half year. The football department of SC Einheit Dresden was reorganized as FSV Lokomotive Dresden on 12 January 1966. Dynamo Dresden was then declared a regional district center of excellence () in Bezirk Dresden by the district board of the <a href="Deutscher%20Turn-%20und%20Sportbund">DTSB</a> on 5 August 1968. The club could now draw on the best players in the whole regional district.
Dynamo Dresden would enjoy the same funding and the same privileges as a designated football club, although it retained its designation as a "Sports Community" () (SG).
Without this support, the club's future success would have been hard to achieve.
Glory years (1969–1978).
During the 1970s, Dynamo established themselves as one of the top teams in East Germany, under the management of <a href="Walter%20Fritzsch">Walter Fritzsch</a>. They won five league titles (<a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20DDR-Oberliga">1971</a>, <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20DDR-Oberliga">1973</a>, <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20DDR-Oberliga">1976</a>, <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20DDR-Oberliga">1977</a> and <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20DDR-Oberliga">1978</a>), and two cups, (<a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20FDGB-Pokal">1971</a> and <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20FDGB-Pokal">1977</a>). They battled with <a href="1.%20FC%20Magdeburg">1. FC Magdeburg</a> for domination of the league, and became the most popular the side in the country, regularly drawing crowds of 25,000, around three times what other clubs were attracting. They also began to establish themselves as a presence in <a href="UEFA">European football</a> – they played in European competition every year during the 1970s, and eliminated some big names – beating <a href="FC%20Porto">FC Porto</a>, <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> and <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> on their way to four quarter-final finishes. During this time Dynamo came up against <a href="West%20Germany">West German</a> opposition for the first time, losing against <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 7–6 on aggregate in the last 16 of the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20European%20Cup">1973–74 European Cup</a>. Dynamo Dresden lost the first leg 4–3 away in Munich and managed a 3–3 draw home at the Dynamo-Stadion. The Stasi had tapped the salon at the Interhotel Newa in Dresden were the Bayern Munich team held their final meeting before the second leg. And a message with information about the line-up of Bayern Munich was quickly sent by motorcycle to the coach of Dynamo Dresden Walter Fritzsch in preparation for the match. On three occasions they were eliminated by English side <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, twice in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> and once in the <a href="European%20Cup">European Cup</a>, and each time Liverpool went on to win the competition. On three other occasions in the 1970s, Dynamo were eliminated by the team that eventually won the tournament — Leeds United in the 1970–71 Fairs Cup, Ajax in the 1971–72 European Cup, and Bayern Munich in the 1973–74 European Cup. In 1973, <a href="Hans-J%C3%BCrgen%20Kreische">Hans-Jürgen Kreische</a> was the first Dynamo Dresden player to be named <a href="East%20German%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">East German Footballer of the Year</a>, and was followed by <a href="Hans-J%C3%BCrgen%20D%C3%B6rner">Hans-Jürgen Dörner</a> in 1977. Kreische was the league's leading goalscorer on four occasions, and was named in <a href="East%20Germany%20national%20football%20team">East Germany</a>'s squad for the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 World Cup</a>, along with teammate <a href="Siegmar%20W%C3%A4tzlich">Siegmar Wätzlich</a>.
Capital dominance (1978–1991).
 <a href="BFC%20Dynamo">BFC Dynamo</a> stood out among other clubs within SV Dynamo. The club was located at the frontline of the Cold war and was a representative of the capital of East Germany. This meant that the club had to be well equipped. BFC Dynamo was considered the favorite club of the president of SV Dynamo and the head of the Stasi Erich Mielke. Under the patronage of Erich Mielke and the Stasi, BFC Dynamo would get access to the best training facilities, equipment, coaching staff and talents.
East German football had generally been set up in favour of the designated <a href="Football%20club%20%28East%20Germany%29">football clubs</a> (FC), who had access to talents within designated areas. Dynamo Dresden was a center of excellence in Bezirk Dresden, which meant that the club had privileged access to talents in the whole regional district. However, BFC Dynamo would be able to draw on talents from all parts of East Germany, except Bezirk Dresden. The club benefited from a nation-wide scouting network, supported by numerous training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo. BFC Dynamo would have the best material conditions in the league and the best team by far. BFC Dynamo won ten consecutive titles, from <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20DDR-Oberliga">1979</a> to <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20DDR-Oberliga">1988</a>. Of all clubs, Dynamo Dresden were the most affected by their success, finishing runners-up on six occasions.
However, Dynamo Dresden also had its patrons. According to <a href="Hans-J%C3%BCrgen%20D%C3%B6rner">Hans-Jürgen Dörner</a>, the club was helped to remain a top club by three local politicians. One of them was <a href="Hans%20Modrow">Hans Modrow</a>, the long-time <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a> First Secretary in <a href="Bezirk%20Dresden">Bezirk Dresden</a>. Another one was , the head of the District Council in Bezirk Dresden. Scheler was a devoted fan, who was active in using his connections to provide players with shortage goods and services, such as a car, an apartment or a plumber. A third was <a href="Lieutenant%20general">Lieutenant general</a> , the long-time head of the regional district authority of the <a href="Volkspolizei">Volkspolizei</a> in Bezirk Dresden. The club also benefited from support by Stasi <a href="Major%20general">Major general</a> , the head of the regional district administration of the Stasi in Bezirk Dresden. Böhm took involvement in the appointment and dismissal of trainers and the contracts of players. He was also a sponsoring member of the club. According to Hans-Jürgen Dörner, Horst Böhm put local patriotism first in the rivalry with BFC Dynamo. The rivalry between fans of the two Dynamo clubs also spread to units within the <a href="Felix%20Dzerzhinsky%20Guards%20Regiment">Stasi Guards Regiment "Felix E. Dzerzhinsky"</a>. Another keen supporter was the long time SED Second Secretary in Bezirk Dresden Lothar Stammnitz.
<a href="Walter%20Fritzsch">Walter Fritzsch</a> had retired in 1978, and was succeeded by <a href="Gerhard%20Prautzsch">Gerhard Prautzsch</a>, who was in turn followed by former players <a href="Klaus%20Sammer">Klaus Sammer</a> (1983–86), <a href="Eduard%20Geyer">Eduard Geyer</a> (1986–90) and <a href="Reinhard%20H%C3%A4fner">Reinhard Häfner</a> (1990–91). The star players of the 1970 were replaced by a new generation, including <a href="Torsten%20G%C3%BCtschow">Torsten Gütschow</a>, <a href="Ulf%20Kirsten">Ulf Kirsten</a>, <a href="Matthias%20Sammer">Matthias Sammer</a>, and <a href="Andreas%20Trautmann">Andreas Trautmann</a>, although the club lost three key players in 1981: <a href="Gerd%20Weber">Gerd Weber</a>, who along with teammates <a href="Peter%20Kotte">Peter Kotte</a> and <a href="Matthias%20M%C3%BCller%20%28footballer%29">Matthias Müller</a> had been offered a lucrative contract with <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>, intended to <a href="Republikflucht">flee to the West</a> while in <a href="Udine">Udine</a> for a <a href="East%20Germany%20national%20football%20team">national team</a> match against Italy in April 1981. The <a href="Stasi">Stasi</a> somehow got wind of this plan, and, in January 1981, the three players were arrested at <a href="Berlin%20Sch%C3%B6nefeld%20Airport">Schönefeld Airport</a>, from where the national team was about depart for <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and banned for life from the <a href="DDR-Oberliga">DDR-Oberliga</a>. Weber was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Kotte and Müller, who had decided to stay in Dresden, were nonetheless punished for their knowledge of Weber's plans. Dynamo Dresden won the <a href="FDGB-Pokal">FDGB-Pokal</a> three times (<a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20FDGB-Pokal">1982</a> and <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20FDGB-Pokal">1984</a>, <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20FDGB-Pokal">1985</a>).
During the 1980s, the club continued its regular participation in European football, generally earning respectable results. In the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1985–86 Cup Winners' Cup</a>, however, they were on the receiving end of a shocking defeat against <a href="Bayer%20Uerdingen">Bayer Uerdingen</a> of <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>: having won the first leg 2–0, they were 3–1 up at half-time in the second leg, when goalkeeper <a href="Bernd%20Jakubowski">Bernd Jakubowski</a> was injured by Uerdingen's <a href="Wolfgang%20Funkel">Wolfgang Funkel</a>. Debutant <a href="Jens%20Ramme">Jens Ramme</a> was introduced, and proceeded to let in six goals, as the team lost 7–3. In addition to this, striker <a href="Frank%20Lippmann">Frank Lippmann</a> took the opportunity of the match in <a href="Krefeld">Krefeld</a> to escape to the west. Dynamo recorded their best ever European performance in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20UEFA%20Cup">1988–89 UEFA Cup</a>, beating <a href="AS%20Roma">AS Roma</a> on the way to a semi-final defeat against VfB Stuttgart. Their last European campaign was the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20European%20Cup">1990–91 European Cup</a>, which ended in defeat to eventual winners <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a>. Dynamo's fans rioted at the second leg, which resulted in the club being banned from Europe for the following season.
The head of the Volkspolizei in Bezirk Dresden was also the head of the branch of SV Dynamo in Bezirk Dresden. The official sponsor () of Dynamo Dresden was the Volkspolizei. Players of Dynamo Dresden were formal employees of the Volkspolizei. Many players then underwent their military service with the Stasi Guards Regiment "Felix E. Dzerzhinsky" and became formal employees of the Stasi. 18 of the 72 players who had played at least once for Dynamo Dresden between 1972 and 1989 had been listed as unofficial collaborators (IM) of the Stasi.
West German chancellor <a href="Helmut%20Kohl">Helmut Kohl</a> privately attended the match between Dynamo Dresden and <a href="FC%20Carl%20Zeiss%20Jena">FC Carl Zeiss Jena</a> in the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20DDR-Oberliga">1987–88 DDR-Oberliga</a> on 28 May 1988, during a private trip to East Germany with his wife Hannelore and son Peter. Dynamo Dresden ended the ten-year long dominance of BFC Dynamo and captured the league title in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20DDR-Oberliga">1988–89 season</a>. The title was celebrated after a 5–0 win against <a href="1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">1. FC Union Berlin</a> in front of 27,000 spectators at the <a href="Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion">Dynamo-Stadion</a> in the last match day on 3 June 1989. Dynamo Dresden won the league title also in the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20DDR-Oberliga">1989–90 season</a>, adding a <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20FDGB-Pokal">cup win</a>, to complete a <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a>. The <a href="Berlin%20wall">Berlin wall</a> opened on 9 November 1989. The Stasi then lost its influence over football mid-season. BFC Dynamo stood at fourth place in the league after the first half of the season, and only finished the 1989–90 season in fourth place. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, many of the top players in East Germany took the opportunity to head west. BFC Dynamo was the first team to lose a top player. The team had lost its top striker <a href="Andreas%20Thom">Andreas Thom</a> already during the winter break, and would lose more top players during the summer. Dynamo Dresden lost two star players during the summer of 1990: <a href="Ulf%20Kirsten">Ulf Kirsten</a> and <a href="Matthias%20Sammer">Matthias Sammer</a> joining <a href="Bayer%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> and <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> respectively. With <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a> looming, many clubs in the East changed their name to shed their Soviet image, and Dynamo Dresden changed from "SG" to the more traditional "1. FC". The DDR-Oberliga also changed name for its final season: the league, now called the <a href="NOFV-Oberliga">NOFV-Oberliga</a>, was used to determine which places the East German clubs would take in the unified <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German league</a>. Dynamo Dresden finished second, behind <a href="Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a>, thus qualifying for the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>.
Bundesliga (1991–1995).
Having been among the top clubs in the East, Dynamo found life in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> much harder, struggling both financially and on the pitch. They spent four years at this level, during which they were in a near-constant battle against relegation. Their highest placing was 13th in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">1993–94</a>, but the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">following year</a> they succumbed to the drop, finishing in last place, having gone through three managers (<a href="Sigfried%20Held">Sigfried Held</a>, <a href="Horst%20Hrubesch">Horst Hrubesch</a> and <a href="Ralf%20Minge">Ralf Minge</a>) during the season. To add to this, the club had accumulated debts of more than 10 million <a href="Deutschmark">DM</a>, and were denied a license to play in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, and had to drop down to the third tier <a href="Regionalliga%20Nordost">Regionalliga Nordost</a>. <a href="Rolf-J%C3%BCrgen%20Otto">Rolf-Jürgen Otto</a>, the club's president was jailed for having <a href="embezzlement">embezzled</a> around 3 million DM from the club.
While many of the stars of the 1980s had moved west, some remained for Dynamo's Bundesliga tenure, including <a href="Torsten%20G%C3%BCtschow">Torsten Gütschow</a> and <a href="Hans-Uwe%20Pilz">Hans-Uwe Pilz</a>, while the club was able to attract players from other Eastern clubs, including <a href="Olaf%20Marschall">Olaf Marschall</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20M%C3%BCller">René Müller</a> and <a href="Heiko%20Scholz">Heiko Scholz</a>. The fall of the wall brought the influx of Dynamo's first foreign players, and the club saw internationals from <a href="Australia%20national%20association%20football%20team">Australia</a> (<a href="Mark%20Schwarzer">Mark Schwarzer</a>), <a href="Poland%20national%20football%20team">Poland</a> (<a href="Piotr%20Nowak">Piotr Nowak</a>), <a href="Russia%20national%20football%20team">Russia</a> (<a href="Stanislav%20Cherchesov">Stanislav Cherchesov</a>) and <a href="Sweden%20national%20football%20team">Sweden</a> (<a href="Johnny%20Ekstr%C3%B6m">Johnny Ekström</a>), among others.
Ups and downs (1995–2006).
Dynamo sought to regroup in the <a href="Fu%C3%9Fball-Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a>, and again looked to former players to manage the team, being led by <a href="Hans-J%C3%BCrgen%20Kreische">Hans-Jürgen Kreische</a> (1995–96), <a href="Udo%20Schmuck">Udo Schmuck</a> (1996) and <a href="Hartmut%20Schade">Hartmut Schade</a> (1996–1998), but did not seriously challenge for promotion. In <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">1998</a>, they finished second in the table, but with 60 points: 32 behind champions <a href="Tennis%20Borussia%20Berlin">Tennis Borussia Berlin</a>. <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">1999–2000</a> saw a restructuring of the Regionalliga: the four leagues were to be reduced to two, and Dynamo would have to finish in the top 7 to avoid relegation. Having finished 11th in the previous season they turned to <a href="Colin%20Bell%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201961%29">Colin Bell</a>, an English coach who had had some success with youth football in Germany, but he left in March 2000 after poor results and a player revolt. <a href="Cor%20Pot">Cor Pot</a>, a <a href="Netherlands">Dutchman</a>, was brought in to replace him, and he turned the team around, but it was too late – they finished in eighth place, and were relegated to the fourth-tier <a href="Oberliga%20Nordost-S%C3%BCd">Oberliga Nordost-Süd</a>. By this point Dynamo were not even the top team in Dresden: <a href="Dresdner%20SC">Dresdner SC</a> had returned after reunification, and finished as runners-up in the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nordost">Regionalliga Nordost</a> in 2000.
Optimism was high, though, after the way the last season had ended, and the slogan "Wir kommen wieder" (we're coming back), was adopted. However, the Oberliga was now highly competitive with <a href="VfB%20Leipzig">VfB Leipzig</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20Magdeburg">1. FC Magdeburg</a> and <a href="FSV%20Zwickau">FSV Zwickau</a> also having been relegated, and Dynamo couldn't match the consistency of their main promotion rivals Magdeburg and Leipzig. A 2–1 defeat against Magdeburg in February ended their promotion chances, and Pot resigned. With nothing to play for, Dynamo slumped <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">to fifth place</a>. For <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">the following season</a>, <a href="Christoph%20Franke">Christoph Franke</a> was brought in as manager, and led the club to promotion – they won the league with only two defeats, and beat <a href="Hertha%20BSC%20II">Hertha BSC's reserve team</a> in a playoff to earn their place in the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a>. Dynamo's youth system was particularly successful during this period, with players including <a href="Lars%20Jungnickel">Lars Jungnickel</a>, <a href="Silvio%20Schr%C3%B6ter">Silvio Schröter</a>, <a href="Maik%20Wagefeld">Maik Wagefeld</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Ziebig">Daniel Ziebig</a> going on to play at a higher level.
Dynamo finished a respectable 7th in their <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">first season back</a> in the third tier, and <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">followed that</a> with another promotion, finishing second behind <a href="Rot-Wei%C3%9F%20Essen">Rot-Weiß Essen</a>. Life in the <a href="2.%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> began brightly, with a 3–1 win against <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a>, but by the halfway point of <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%202.%20Bundesliga">their first season</a> they were facing relegation, with only 18 points. They recovered strongly in the second half of the season though, and finished in 8th place, thanks in part to signings such as <a href="Ansgar%20Brinkmann">Ansgar Brinkmann</a>, <a href="Joshua%20Kennedy">Joshua Kennedy</a> and <a href="Klemen%20Lavric">Klemen Lavric</a>. The <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%202.%20Bundesliga">2005–06</a> season began in a similar way, as Dynamo climbed to third place with a 2–1 win over <a href="1860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a> in the <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz Arena</a>, but this was followed by thirteen matches without a win, resulting in the dismissal of Christoph Franke. Austrian manager <a href="Peter%20Pacult">Peter Pacult</a> was brought in, with results improving temporarily, but Dynamo still failed to avoid relegation, finishing 15th.
Consolidation (2006–present).
Dynamo were back in the <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a> with the immediate aim of promotion, yet, despite a successful start, <a href="Peter%20Pacult">Peter Pacult</a> left the club after six matches for a chance to manage his former club, <a href="Rapid%20Vienna">Rapid Vienna</a>. He was replaced by <a href="Norbert%20Meier">Norbert Meier</a>, but Dynamo could not keep up their promotion bid, and finished seventh, due in part to poor away form. Another re-organisation of the league structure was looming, and Dynamo knew they'd have to finish in the top-10 to qualify for the new national <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>. A number of former star players returned, including <a href="Lars%20Jungnickel">Lars Jungnickel</a>, <a href="Marek%20Penksa">Marek Penksa</a> and <a href="Maik%20Wagefeld">Maik Wagefeld</a>, but results were not consistent, and Meier was sacked, replaced by former coach <a href="Eduard%20Geyer">Eduard Geyer</a>. Dynamo secured qualification on the last day, finishing eighth, but Geyer was dismissed due to disagreements with the board. In 2007, the club reverted to the name "SG Dynamo Dresden".
The club turned to <a href="Ruud%20Kaiser">Ruud Kaiser</a>, a <a href="Netherlands">Dutchman</a> with a good reputation at youth level, as Geyer's replacement. They played in the first ever match of the third Liga, beating <a href="Rot-Wei%C3%9F%20Erfurt">Rot-Weiß Erfurt</a> 1–0 with a goal from <a href="Halil%20Savran">Halil Savran</a>, but results were not consistent, and they <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">could only finish</a> in mid-table. The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">2009–10</a> season began badly, and, with Dynamo in relegation trouble, Kaiser was sacked and replaced by <a href="Matthias%20Maucksch">Matthias Maucksch</a>, a former player who had had some success with <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden%20II">the reserve team</a>. Maucksch managed to drag the team away from relegation, and finished the season in 12th place. Maucksch led the team to contention for a playoff place during the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%203.%20Liga">2010–11</a> season, but was sacked in April after a run of five games without a win, and was replaced by <a href="Ralf%20Loose">Ralf Loose</a>. Loose ended the season unbeaten and secured third place, and a playoff against <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a> which Dynamo won <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%202.%20Bundesliga%23Relegation%20play-offs">4–2 on aggregate</a> to earn promotion to the <a href="2.%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>.
Dynamo Dresden performed well in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">their first season back in the league</a>. Consistently holding a position in the middle of the standings, the team was never in danger of being relegated. After securing a highly memorable 4–3 victory after being down three goals against <a href="Bayer%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> in the first round of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20DFB-Pokal">2011–12 DFB-Pokal season</a>, Dynamo was excluded from the 2012/2013 DFB-Pokal due to fan excesses and abuse of fireworks during the second round match against Borussia Dortmund (0–2) in a first trial. The sentence was later turned into one <a href="Behind%20closed%20doors%20%28football%29">Game behind closed doors</a> and one away game without own fan support. Virtual tickets were offered to reduce the financial loss, leading to what was purported to be the first sold-out ghost game in history. The 2012–13 season started poorly for Dynamo and <a href="Ralf%20Loose">Ralf Loose</a> was sacked in December 2012 after a 3–0 defeat to <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a> with the team in 15th place. He was replaced by <a href="Peter%20Pacult">Peter Pacult</a>, returning to the club after more than six years. Dynamo's form improved after Pacult's arrival, but the team still finished the league as 16th. Due to this, Dynamo had to enter relegation play-offs again after just two seasons, incidentally meeting <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a> once more, with their roles now reversed. Dynamo emerged victorious with <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%202.%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga%23Relegation%20play-offs">2–1 on aggregate</a> and remained in the second tier for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">2013–14 season</a>. Pacult was sacked in August 2013 after a poor start and replaced with <a href="Olaf%20Jan%C3%9Fen">Olaf Janßen</a>. Jansen was unable to save the club from the drop to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> after they lost 3–2 at home to relegation rivals <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a> to drop into 17th place, a result which ultimately cost Jansen his job. Dynamo had drawn half of their matches, winning just five all season.
Under their new coach <a href="Stefan%20B%C3%B6ger">Stefan Böger</a>, the club completely overhauled the squad with the intent of returning to the 2. Bundesliga as soon as possible. In August 2014, the team knocked Bundesliga giants <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">FC Schalke 04</a> out of the first round of the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, beating them with 2–1. The team advanced to the third round after beating <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a> 2–1, but were ultimately knocked out by <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. Böger was sacked in February 2015, with assistant coach <a href="Peter%20N%C3%A9meth">Peter Németh</a> taking over for the remainder for the season. The team finished 6th in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%203.%20Liga">2014–15 season</a>. Under new manager <a href="Uwe%20Neuhaus">Uwe Neuhaus</a>, Dynamo went on to have <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Dynamo%20Dresden%20season">a hugely successful season</a>, and officially returned to second-level competition after a 2–2 draw at an away match against <a href="FC%20Magdeburg">FC Magdeburg</a> on 16 April 2016.
SV Dynamo.
When they were founded as "SG Volkspolizei", the club was sponsored by the <a href="Volkspolizei">East German police force</a>, and in 1953, when they became "Dynamo Dresden" they were part of the <a href="SV%20Dynamo">SV Dynamo</a>, the sport organization of the security agencies. Dynamo were the most powerful of all the sports societies, and this conferred certain advantages on the club. While many former security service clubs have struggled to shed their negative image, particularly <a href="BFC%20Dynamo">BFC Dynamo</a>, Dynamo Dresden remain popular and well-supported, having come to represent their home city.
Stadium.
Dynamo plays at the <a href="Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion">Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion</a>, which was opened in 1923, and also originally named the "Rudolf-Harbig-Stadion" after local track and field athlete <a href="Rudolf%20Harbig">Rudolf Harbig</a>. The stadium was renamed "Dynamo-Stadion" by the East German authorities in 1971, but reverted to its former name after the reunification. With an original capacity of 24,000 spectators, the stadium was rebuilt in the beginning of the 1990s, in line with <a href="German%20Football%20Association">DFB</a> and <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> regulations, and was thoroughly modernised between June 2007 and December 2009. The modernized stadium opened on 15 September 2009 with a <a href="exhibition%20match">friendly match</a> against <a href="Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> and has a capacity of 32,066 spectators.
Supporters.
Dynamo were one of <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>'s best-supported clubs, regularly drawing crowds of around 25,000 during their heyday. Since reunification attendance levels have fluctuated along with the team's fortunes, while they were still one of the most well-supported teams in the lower leagues, drawing an average of around 10–15,000 fans in the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>. Following their <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%203.%20Liga">2011 advance</a> to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2nd League</a>, they were again drawing crowds of 25,000. The <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%202.%20Bundesliga">2013–14</a> season average attendance reached 27,004. Dynamo's supporters have very close relations with <a href="FK%20Sarajevo">FK Sarajevo</a> fans, <a href="Horde%20zla">Horde zla</a>. In December 2020, Dynamo fans bought 72,000 tickets for the cup match at home to Darmstadt, even though it was played in an empty stadium – to show support for the struggling club.
Relationships with other clubs.
Dynamo Dresden have a particularly fractious relationship with <a href="BFC%20Dynamo">BFC Dynamo</a>, who took over the first team and the place in the DDR-Oberliga from Dynamo Dresden in 1954, then as a football section of <a href="SC%20Dynamo%20Berlin">SC Dynamo Berlin</a>. BFC Dynamo were their main obstacle to success in the 1980s, but the two clubs rarely meet these days. <a href="1.%20FC%20Lokomotive%20Leipzig">1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig</a> were traditionally Dynamo's main rivals in the battle for <a href="Saxony">Saxon</a> dominance, although this rivalry extends to other clubs, including <a href="Chemnitzer%20FC">Chemnitzer FC</a>, formerly <a href="FC%20Sachsen%20Leipzig">FC Sachsen Leipzig</a>, <a href="Erzgebirge%20Aue">Erzgebirge Aue</a>, and, most recently, upstart <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a>, though the clubs' disparate financial capabilities have so far prevented them from ever playing in the same division, their only official encounter thus far being a first-round match in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20DFB-Pokal">2016–17 DFB-Pokal</a> season, in which Dresden celebrated a hard-fought victory.
Dynamo's most noteworthy rival in their home city are <a href="Dresdner%20SC">Dresdner SC</a>, although they are perpetually ill-matched, as Dresdner SC are mired in local football leagues. Another club, <a href="SC%20Borea%20Dresden">SC Borea Dresden</a> were formed out of "SG Dynamo Dresden-Heide", a former <a href="feeder%20club">feeder club</a> for Dynamo, but there is no longer an official connection.
Colours and crest.
When they were formed as "SG Volkspolizei Dresden", the club wore green and white, the colours of the former province of <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>. Green and white were the colours of the <a href="Volkspolizei">Volkspolizei</a>. When the team became part of <a href="SV%20Dynamo">SV Dynamo</a> they adopted the sports society's <a href="wine%20red">wine red</a> colour scheme. In 1968, the club was declared a regional center of excellence in <a href="Bezirk%20Dresden">Bezirk Dresden</a> and adopted its current colours of yellow and black, the city colours of <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>.
The club's original crest was built around the shield of the <a href="Volkspolizei">Volkspolizei</a>, to whom they were affiliated. In 1953 they adopted the "D" logo of SV Dynamo, which was retained until <a href="German%20reunification">reunification</a>, when its wine red background was replaced with Saxon green. They reverted to the red background in the early 2000s.
Dynamo Dresden II.
The <a href="German%20reserve%20football%20teams">club's reserve team</a>, Dynamo Dresden II, played until 2015 in the tier five <a href="NOFV-Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd">NOFV-Oberliga Süd</a>. It has played at this level since 2009 with a fourth place in 2012 as its best result. In March 2015, the club announced that it would withdraw the reserve team from league competition and instead enter it in a friendlies competition with the reserve teams of <a href="Chemnitzer%20FC">Chemnitzer FC</a>, <a href="Hallescher%20FC">Hallescher FC</a>, <a href="Sparta%20Prague">Sparta Prague</a>, <a href="FC%20Slovan%20Liberec">FC Slovan Liberec</a> and <a href="FK%20Teplice">FK Teplice</a>. However, though the competition's name Future League would suggest a more organized and concrete structure, this has so far led to little more than an incoherent series of friendly matches between amateur teams, with the idea appearing to have been largely abandoned by the participating clubs, despite some declarations of intent.
The team also made a losing appearance in the 1995 <a href="Saxony%20Cup">Saxony Cup</a> final and won the competition in 2009.
Coaching history.
"Dynamo" enjoyed its greatest successes under Walter Fritzsch, capturing the first division DDR-Oberliga title in 1971, 1973, 1976, 1977, 1978, as well as finishing as vice-champions four times. The team also took the East German Cup (FDGB Pokal) in 1971 and 1977.
Notable former players.

SC Paderborn 07

Sport-Club Paderborn 07 e.V., commonly known as simply SC Paderborn 07 () or SC Paderborn, is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> based in <a href="Paderborn">Paderborn</a>, <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>. The club has enjoyed its greatest success since the turn of the millennium, becoming a fixture in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> before securing promotion to the Bundesliga in the 2013–14 season. They suffered a hasty fall from grace, however, being relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after only a season in the top division, and then again to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> the season after. This relegation streak almost continued as low as the <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a>, but were saved in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%203.%20Liga">2016-17 season</a> because <a href="1860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a> were refused a license. The club returned to 2. Bundesliga, reaching 2nd place in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%202.%20Bundesliga">2018–19 season</a> and was promoted to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. The club finished 18th in the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bundesliga">2019–20 season</a> and returned to the 2. Bundesliga.
History.
Fusion into SC Paderborn.
For most of the twentieth century, Paderborn had two football clubs: TuS Schloss Neuhaus and FC Paderborn, who remained rivals until the 1980s. After Neuhaus had been promoted to the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%202.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> and finished last in 1983, this set-up had reached its athletic and financial ceiling. Thus, in 1985, the two clubs merged into "TuS Paderborn/Neuhaus". In 1997, the club adopted its current identity by assuming the name "SC Paderborn 07", named after TuS Neuhaus's founding date 1907.
Beginnings in amateur football (1985–2005).
During most of the 1980s, the recently merged club competed in the third-tier <a href="Oberliga%20Westfalen">Oberliga Westfalen</a>, where they counted among the leading teams but never achieved promotion. In 1994, Paderborn won the league and thereby qualified for the promotion playoffs. The team lost to <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a> and <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>, but secured a place in the newly formed third-tier of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football pyramid</a>, the <a href="Regionalliga%20West/S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga West/Südwest</a>. Except for a brief stint in the fourth tier, Paderborn enjoyed moderate success with regular trips to the <a href="DFB%20Pokal">DFB Pokal</a>.
During one of these, in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20DFB-Pokal">2004/5</a>, the club reached the round of 16, beating <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a> and Bundesliga side <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> on the way. It later emerged that latter match had been affected by <a href="Bundesliga%20scandal%20%282005%29">match fixing</a>; referee Robert Hoyzer had received a bribe to let Paderborn win the game. The incident remains the most significant betting scandal in the history of German football. 
Consolidation in the 2. Bundesliga (2005–15).
Paderborn returned to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> for the first time in nearly thirty years at the end of the same season. The team's advance into professional football brought with it a professionalisation of its structures, and, in 2005, construction began on a new <a href="Benteler-Arena">15,000-seat stadium</a>, which replaced the dated <a href="Hermann-L%C3%B6ns-Stadion">Hermann-Löns-Stadion</a>. All of this helped to establish the club as a regular component of Germany's professional football landscape. This process culminated in the club's first promotion to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> after the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%202.%20Bundesliga">2013/14 season</a> under coach <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breitenreiter">André Breitenreiter</a>, who had only joined the club from <a href="TSV%20Havelse">TSV Havelse</a> at the start of the season.
Bundesliga and years of turbulence (2015–present).
Having never been in the Bundesliga before, Paderborn were described as "the biggest outsider in Bundesliga history" going into the season. The team started well; in the fourth game of the campaign against <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a>, midfielder <a href="Moritz%20Stoppelkamp">Moritz Stoppelkamp</a> scored a volley from 83 metres out, headline a Bundesliga record for the furthest ever goal. This goal also put the team top of the Bundesliga table at the time.
Paderborn were 10th in the table at the halfway point, but suffered a number of heavy losses in the second half of the season. On the second last matchday of the season, they dropped to last place, and were relegated on the final day. Upon relegation, a number of key players such as <a href="Alban%20Meha">Alban Meha</a>, <a href="Mario%20Vran%C4%8Di%C4%87">Mario Vrančić</a>, <a href="Lukas%20Rupp">Lukas Rupp</a>, <a href="Marvin%20Ducksch">Marvin Ducksch</a> and captain <a href="Uwe%20H%C3%BCnemeier">Uwe Hünemeier</a> left the club, while coach Breitenreiter joined <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke</a>.
Starting the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%202.%20Bundesliga">2015–16 season</a> with <a href="Markus%20Gellhaus">Markus Gellhaus</a> in charge, Paderborn surprisingly gave former Germany international <a href="Stefan%20Effenberg">Stefan Effenberg</a> his first coaching job in October 2015. In March, Effenberg was sacked, with the team bottom of the table and heading for a second consecutive relegation, which was later confirmed. Competing in the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> for the first time since 2009, Paderborn again found themselves at the bottom of the table. After <a href="Steffen%20Baumgart">Steffen Baumgart</a> took over as coach in April, the team picked up 11 points from his five games in charge, but could not escape the relegation zone, finishing in 18th position. That should have been a third relegation in a row, this time to the non-professional <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a>, but Paderborn were unexpectedly saved by <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a> not receiving a license to play in the 3. Liga. 1860 were forced to move to the <a href="Regionalliga%20Bayern">Regionalliga Bayern</a>, which allowed Paderborn to stay in the third tier.
Having been saved narrowly, Baumgart's team surprisingly finished second in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%203.%20Liga">2017–18 season</a> and returned to the 2. Bundesliga. In 2019, a remarkable turn of events, the newly promoted side completed another top-two finish, which returned Paderborn to the Bundesliga after years of turbulence. The <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bundesliga">2019–20 season</a>, however, ended in the same way their first Bundesliga campaign did, as Paderborn finished last, meaning relegation back to the second tier in June 2020. The following season, Paderborn finished 9th in the 2. Bundesliga, the first time since 2012–13 that the club finished outside the promotion or relegation places.

MSV Duisburg

Meidericher Spielverein 02 e. V. Duisburg, commonly known as simply MSV Duisburg (), is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> based in <a href="Duisburg">Duisburg</a>, <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>. Nicknamed "Die Zebras" for their traditional striped jerseys, the club was one of the original members of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> when it was formed in 1963, although they are now playing in the third tier of German football.
History.
Early years.
The club was founded in 1902 as "Meidericher Spielverein", representing the city of <a href="Meiderich">Meiderich</a>, which became a district of Duisburg in 1905. In 1905, they absorbed the club "Sport Club Viktoria Meiderich". In 1967, they took on their current name, acknowledging their role as the city's most popular and successful side.
While Duisburg has always been a competitive side, real success has so far eluded them. Early in their history, they won a number of local championships, and even enjoyed a pair of undefeated seasons (1913–14) when they scored 113 goals while only giving up 12. In 1929, they won the first Niederrhein championship and qualified for the first time for the national championship rounds, repeating the feat in 1931.
However, the club then went into a tailspin from which they did not really recover until the 1950s, when they began once again to field competitive sides. During World War II, the club came close to folding, but returned to play after the war, emerging as city champions in 1946. In 1951, Duisburg earned promotion to the top-flight Oberliga West with their first-place finish in the 2. Oberliga West. The Oberliga West was the most competitive division of German football at the time, and except for the 1954–55 season, Duisburg would play first division football there right up to the time of the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>.
Entry to the Bundesliga.
The club's play was good enough to earn a place as one of the original 16 teams in Germany's new professional league, the Bundesliga, in 1963. That first season was their most successful as they finished second, behind champions <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>. The "Zebras" spent nearly 20 years in the upper league before slipping to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in 1982–83 and then becoming one of German football's "<a href="yo-yo%20club">elevator teams</a>", named for their frequent up and down moves between divisions. Even then, they played another eight seasons in the Bundesliga over two-and-half decades.
Current.
MSV Duisburg won promotion to the Bundesliga for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a> by way of a third-place finish in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%202.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, behind <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a> and <a href="FC%20Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a>. Duisburg defeated <a href="Rot-Weiss%20Essen">Rot-Weiss Essen</a> in a dramatic contest on the last day of the season 3–0, which secured their promotion for the fifth time in the last two decades while relegating Essen. However, the club fared poorly in top flight play and was again relegated after an 18th-place result. In <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%202.%20Bundesliga">2008–09</a>, they focused on the re-promotion, but although they lost only twice under their new coach <a href="Peter%20Neururer">Peter Neururer</a> and went unbeaten for 12 matches after him taking office, they missed the promotion. During the next season, they focused on the promotion again, but after a heavy 0–5 defeat in the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> against <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a>, Neururer was sacked. On 2 November 2009, <a href="Milan%20%C5%A0a%C5%A1i%C4%87">Milan Šašić</a> was presented as new coach. The Croat became the third foreign coach in the club history. They finished the season like the previous one, sixth in the league table.
In 2010–11, MSV Duisburg surprisingly reached their fourth <a href="2011%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">DFB-Pokal Final</a>—after 1966, 1975 and 1998—where they played against <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>. The game was lopsided, with MSV Duisburg conceding early on, and the game ultimately finishing 5–0 in favour of Schalke.
After being demoted to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> in 2013, Duisburg was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga for the 2015–16 season. The team placed 16th and lost the playoffs, therefore the team was dropped back to the 3. Liga for the 2016–17 season. They won the 3. Liga and were again promoted to the 2. Bundesliga next season.
In popular culture.
"<a href="Tatort">Tatort</a>", a popular crime series in Germany, features an episode entitled "" (Blood of Two Kinds) which deals with a murder in the MSV Duisburg <a href="Football%20hooliganism">hooligan</a> scene. In one scene, Inspector <a href="Horst%20Schimanski">Horst Schimanski</a> is beaten to a pulp and dragged naked into the centre circle of the <a href="Wedaustadion">Wedaustadion</a>.

1. FC Saarbrücken

1. Fußball-Club Saarbrücken () is a German <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">football club</a> based in <a href="Saarbr%C3%BCcken">Saarbrücken</a>, <a href="Saarland">Saarland</a>. The club plays in the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>, which is the third tier of football in Germany.
History.
The club began its existence as the football department of "Turnverein Malstatt" formed in 1903. That department split off in 1907 to form the independent football club "FV Malstatt-Burbach" and on 1 April 1909 was renamed "FV Saarbrücken".
The club became part of the tier-one <a href="Kreisliga%20Saar">Kreisliga Saar</a> in 1919 where it played with moderate success. A second place finish in the league's last season in 1922–23 was their best result. From 1923, the club played in the <a href="Bezirksliga%20Rhein-Saar">Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar</a> – Saar division, winning the title there in 1927–28 but later missing out on qualification to the new national first division <a href="Gauliga">Gauliga</a> in 1933.
Nazi era (1933–1945).
The team did make its way to first division play in 1935 in the <a href="Gauliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Gauliga Südwest</a>, one of sixteen regional divisions established in the re-organization of German football in the Nazi era. A league shuffle saw them in the Gauliga Südwest-Saarpfalz in 1940 and they won the division the next year. In 1943, they again won their divisionnow called the <a href="Gauliga%20Westmark">Gauliga Westmark</a>and advanced through the playoff rounds to the national final where they were defeated 0–3 by <a href="Dresdner%20SC">Dresdner SC</a>. The next year, they only made it as far as the quarterfinals where they were put out by <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>. During the latter years of World War II from 1943 to 1945, the club played as part of the combined wartime side "Kriegsspielgemeinschaft Saarbrücken" with <a href="SC%20Altenkessel">SC Altenkessel</a>.
Post war and French exile.
After the war, occupying Allied authorities dissolved most organizations within Germany, including sports and football clubs, as part of the process of <a href="de-Nazification">de-Nazification</a>. The team was allowed to reform late in 1945, but under the new name "1. FC Saarbrücken". The club played its first three seasons of post-war football in the first division <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCdwest%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Südwest-Nord</a>, winning the division championship in 1946.
The German state of <a href="Saarland">Saarland</a>, where the city of Saarbrücken is located, was <a href="Saar%20%28protectorate%29">occupied by the French</a> after the war. They made various efforts to see the state become independent of Germany or join France. In sport, this was manifested as separate 1952 Olympic and <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">1954 FIFA World Cup</a> <a href="Saarland%20national%20football%20team">teams for Saarland</a> and the establishment of a short-lived football league for the state called the <a href="Ehrenliga%20Saarland">Ehrenliga</a>. In 1948, "1. FC Saarbrücken" was one of a number of sides forced out of German football, but unlike other clubs, they did not play in the puppet league. Instead, the strong side became part of the French second division as "FC Sarrebruck". They won the division but were refused promotion or further participation, mainly due to the resistance of other clubs, among them <a href="RC%20Strasbourg%20Alsace">Strasbourg</a>, which had been forced to play in German competition during World War II.
"Saarbrücken" withdrew from the league and began to play in a series of friendlies over the next two years. They organized a tournament in 1949–50 called the <a href="Internationaler%20Saarlandpokal">Internationaler Saarlandpokal</a> ("International Saarland Cup") that had them play 15 home matches against teams from Austria, Denmark, France, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. The top three sides then joined hosts Saarbrücken in a playoff round, which the home team eventually won in a 4–0 victory over <a href="Stade%20Rennais%20UC">Stade Rennais UC</a> of France. The next year, fellow Saarlanders <a href="Borussia%20Neunkirchen">VfB Neunkirchen</a> co-hosted the tournament which this time included more German sides. The tournament was abandoned for 1952 as an agreement was reached to allow teams from the Saarland re-admission to the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB).
This episode in the history of German football would play itself out with the odd appearance of a separate side from Saarland in the 1954 World Cup preliminary rounds. Without a proper home in either the German or French leagues, Saarland had established a separate football association with membership in <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>. "1. FC Saarbrücken" sent ten players to that national side and the Saarlanders acquitted themselves well, finishing second in their group ahead of <a href="Norway%20national%20football%20team">Norway</a> and behind group winner <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a>. Saarbrücken would also make an appearance in the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20European%20Cup">1955–56 European Cup</a> as Saarland's representative and were eliminated by <a href="AC%20Milan">Milan</a> in the first round, despite winning the away leg.
Return to German football and entry to the Bundesliga.
Saarbrücken returned to the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCdwest%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Südwest</a> in 1952 and continued their winning ways by winning the division and advancing to the national final for the second time, losing a 1–2 decision to <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>. They continued to field strong sides, but over the next decade, could only manage one more Oberliga title, in 1961.
In 1963, Germany finally saw the creation of a top flight national league with the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. Sixteen teams were selected to play in the new league based on their performance, financial health and a geographical distribution intended to fairly represent all parts of the country. The first eight selections were straightforward and included divisional champions and the national finalists. Saarbrücken's selection to the new league was arguably the most controversial as the club's recent record was not as strong as their divisional rivals Neunkirchen, <a href="FK%20Pirmasens">FK Pirmasens</a> and <a href="Wormatia%20Worms">Wormatia Worms</a>. The belief is that their advantage lay in the fact the club had a long association with <a href="Hermann%20Neuberger">Hermann Neuberger</a>, an extremely influential figure in German football – and a member of the selection committee.
At the end of the inaugural Bundesliga season in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Bundesliga">1963–64</a>, Saarbrücken found themselves last, seven points short of safety. The club was relegated to the second tier <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest%20%281963%E2%80%931974%29">Regionalliga Südwest</a> where they finished strongly in each of the next three seasons, but were unable to advance through the Bundesliga promotion rounds. They were finally able to make their way back to the top flight after a first-place finish in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281974%E2%80%9381%29">2. Bundesliga Süd</a> in the 1976 season. After two seasons there, the team returned to the second division and by 1981 had slipped to the Amateur <a href="Oberliga%20Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar">Oberliga Südwest</a> (III). There were two more turns in the Bundesliga, in 1986 and 1993, both ending in relegation. A financial crisis in 1995 led to the club being denied a licence and being sent down to the <a href="Regionalliga%20West/S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga West/Südwest</a> (III). Saarbrücken has since become a <a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo club</a> with frequent moves between the second and fifth tiers. During this time, the club has remained a strong local side with several Saarland-Pokal wins to its credit.
Saarbrücken finished 16th in 2005–06 and were relegated to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> (III). Another poor showing in 2006–07 saw the club in 15th and relegated again, this time to the fourth division Oberliga Südwest, where they narrowly missed out on Regionalliga promotion in 2007–08. However, they finished as the champions of the Oberliga Südwest in the 2008–09 season and were promoted to the <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a>. In May 2010, they finished champions of the Regionalliga West season and were promoted to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>, their second consecutive promotion. They started slowly, but finished in sixth place having won the last nine matches of the 2010–11 season, and remained at this level until 2013–14, when a disastrous season saw then finish bottom of the table, having used 36 players and four managers.
Back in the Regionalliga, Saarbrücken came second in <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Regionalliga%23Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">2014–15</a> and qualified for the promotion round to the 3. Liga, where they missed out on promotion to the <a href="W%C3%BCrzburger%20Kickers">Würzburger Kickers</a>. They won the Regionalliga Südwest by 11 points in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Regionalliga%23Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">2017–18</a> but were again defeated in the promotion play-off, this time by <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a>.
On 3 March 2020, they became the first team from the fourth tier in the history of the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> to reach the semi-final, after beating <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a> in the quarter-final. On November 1, 2023, "Saarbrücken" (as a 3. Liga side) upset Bundesliga giants <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">FC Bayern Munich</a> with a historic 2 - 1 win to advance to the round of 16 in the <a href="2023-24%20DFB-Pokal">2023-24 DFB-Pokal</a>. At this stage they met Eintracht Frankfurt, another of the most well-established teams in the Bundesliga. An eventful second-half left the home side 2-0 victors and moving through to the final 8.
Reserve team.
The club's reserve team, now the <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken%20II">1. FC Saarbrücken II</a>, playing as the 1. FC Saarbrücken Amateure until 2005 during the times the senior side played in professional football, first made an appearance in the <a href="Ehrenliga%20Saarland">Ehrenliga Saarland</a> from 1948 to 1951. It made a reappearance in the highest league of the state in 1986, now the tier four <a href="Verbandsliga%20Saarland">Verbandsliga Saarland</a> and won the league in 1988. Nine seasons in the Oberliga Südwest, now the <a href="Oberliga%20Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar">Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar</a> followed. The team was relegated from the Oberliga in 1997, 2001 and 2007 to return each time a short while later. In 2002 it won the <a href="Saarland%20Cup">Saarland Cup</a> for the first and only time, thereby qualifying for the first round of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20DFB-Pokal">2002–03 DFB-Pokal</a>, where it lost to <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a>.

It is best known for its professional men's <a href="association%20football">association football</a> team, which plays in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, the top tier of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>. Bayern is the most successful club in German football history, having won a record 33 <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">national titles</a>, including eleven consecutively since 2013, and 20 <a href="DFB-Pokal">national cups</a>, along with numerous European honours.
Bayern Munich was founded in 1900 by eleven players, led by <a href="Franz%20John">Franz John</a>. Although Bayern won its first national championship in <a href="1932%20German%20football%20championship">1932</a>, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at <a href="Introduction%20of%20the%20Bundesliga">its inception in 1963</a>. The club had its period of greatest success in the mid-1970s when, under the <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captaincy</a> of <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, they won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> three consecutive times (1974–1976). Overall, Bayern have won six European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles (a German record), winning their sixth title in the <a href="2020%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2020 final</a> as part of the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">Treble</a>, after which it became the second European club to achieve the feat twice. Bayern has also won one <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, one <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, two <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>s, two <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>s and two <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cups</a>, making it <a href="List%20of%20UEFA%20club%20competition%20winners">one of the most successful European clubs internationally</a>, and the only German club to have won both international titles.

History.
Early years (1900s–1960s).
Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879). When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of the club would not be allowed to join the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB), eleven members of the football division left the congregation and on the same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months, Bayern achieved high-scoring victories against all local rivals, including a 15–0 win against Nordstern, and reached the semi-finals of the 1900–01 <a href="Southern%20German%20football%20championship">South German championship</a>. In the following years, the club won some local trophies, and, in 1910–11, Bayern joined the newly founded "Kreisliga", the first regional Bavarian league. The club won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany. By the end of its first decade of founding, Bayern had its first German national team player, Max Gablonsky. By 1920, it had over 700 members, making it the largest football club in Munich.
In the years after the war, Bayern won several regional competitions before winning its first South German championship in 1926, an achievement repeated two years later. Its first national title was gained in <a href="German%20football%20championship%201932">1932</a>, when coach <a href="Richard%20Kohn">Richard "Little Dombi" Kohn</a> led the team to the <a href="German%20champions%20%28football%29">German championship</a> by defeating <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> 2–0 in the final.
The rise of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> to power put an abrupt end to Bayern's development. Club president <a href="Kurt%20Landauer">Kurt Landauer</a> and the coach, both of whom were Jewish, left the country. Many others in the club were also purged. Bayern was taunted as the "<a href="Judenklub">Jew's club</a>", while local rival <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a> gained much support. Josef Sauter, who was inaugurated in 1943, was the only NSDAP member as president. After a friendly match in Switzerland, some Bayern players greeted Landauer, who was a spectator, and the club was subject to continued discrimination. Bayern was also affected by the ruling that football players had to be full amateurs again, which led to the move of gifted young centre-forward <a href="Oskar%20Rohr">Oskar Rohr</a> to <a href="Swiss%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a>. In the following years, Bayern could not sustain its role of contender for the national title, achieving mid-table results in its regional league instead.
After the end of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> in 1945, Bayern became a member of the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Süd</a>, the southern conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947, and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club's president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed the most important figure in Bayern's transition to a professional club. In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the "Oberliga" in the following season and won the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> for the first time, beating <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a> 1–0 in the <a href="DFB-Pokal%201956%E2%80%9357%23Final">final</a>.
The club struggled financially, though, verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s. President Reitlinger was ousted in the club's elections of 1958 by the industrialist Roland Endler, who provided financial stability for the club. Under his reign, Bayern had its best years in the Oberliga. Endler was no longer a candidate in 1962, when <a href="Wilhelm%20Neudecker">Wilhelm Neudecker</a>, who became wealthy in the postwar construction boom, replaced him.
In 1963, the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league, the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. The key to qualifying for the Bundesliga was the accumulated record of the last twelve years, where Bayern was only the sixth-ranked club. To boot, local rivals <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a>, ranked seventh, were champions of the last Oberliga-Süd season and were given preference on the basis of this achievement. After initial protests by Bayern for alleged mistreatment remained fruitless, president Neudecker rose to the challenge and hired <a href="Zlatko%20%C4%8Cajkovski">Zlatko Čajkovski</a>, who in 1962 led <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> to the national championship. Fielding a team with young players like <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, <a href="Gerd%20M%C3%BCller">Gerd Müller</a> and <a href="Sepp%20Maier">Sepp Maier</a> – who would later be collectively referred to as "the axis", they achieved promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965.
The golden years (1960s–1970s).
In their first Bundesliga <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Bundesliga">season</a>, Bayern finished third and also won the <a href="DFB-Pokal%201965%E2%80%9366">DFB-Pokal</a>. This qualified them for the following year's <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, which they won in the <a href="1967%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">final</a> against Scottish club <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>, <a href="Franz%20Roth">Franz Roth</a> scoring the decider in a 1–0 <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a> victory. In 1967, Bayern retained the <a href="DFB-Pokal%201966%E2%80%9367">DFB-Pokal</a>, but slow overall progress saw <a href="Branko%20Zebec">Branko Zebec</a> take over as coach. He replaced Bayern's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach, and in doing so achieved the first <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Bundesliga">league</a> and <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20DFB-Pokal">cup</a> <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> and <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>. Zebec used only 13 players throughout <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">the season</a>.
<a href="Udo%20Lattek">Udo Lattek</a> took charge in 1970. After winning the <a href="DFB-Pokal%201970%E2%80%9371">DFB-Pokal</a> in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">his first season</a>, Lattek led Bayern to their <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Bundesliga">third German championship</a>. The deciding match in the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">1971–72</a> season against <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> was the first match in the new <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Munich%29">Olympiastadion</a>, and was also the first live televised match in Bundesliga history. Bayern beat Schalke 5–1, so won the title, while also setting several records, including points gained and goals scored. Bayern also won the next two championships, but the zenith was their triumph in the <a href="1974%20European%20Cup%20Final">1974 European Cup Final</a> against <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, which Bayern won 4–0 after a replay. This title – after winning the Cup Winners' trophy 1967 and two semi-finals (<a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1968</a> and <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1972</a>) in that competition – marked the club's breakthrough as a force on the international stage.
During the following years, the team was unsuccessful domestically, but defended their European title by defeating <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> in the <a href="1975%20European%20Cup%20final">1975 European Cup final</a>, when Roth and Müller secured victory with late goals. "We came back into the game and scored two lucky goals, so in the end, we were the winners, but we were very, very lucky", stated Franz Beckenbauer. <a href="Billy%20Bremner">Billy Bremner</a> believed the French referee was "very suspicious". Leeds fans then rioted in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and were banned from European football for three years. A year later in <a href="1976%20European%20Cup%20final">the final</a> in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, another Roth goal helped defeat <a href="AS%20Saint-%C3%89tienne">Saint-Étienne</a>, and Bayern became the third club to win the trophy in three consecutive years. The final trophy won by Bayern in this era was the <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a>, in which they defeated Brazilian club <a href="Cruzeiro%20Esporte%20Clube">Cruzeiro</a> over two legs. The rest of the decade was a time of change and saw no further titles for Bayern. In 1977, Franz Beckenbauer left for <a href="New%20York%20Cosmos%20%281971%E2%80%931985%29">New York Cosmos</a> and, in 1979, Sepp Maier and <a href="Uli%20Hoene%C3%9F">Uli Hoeneß</a> retired while Gerd Müller joined the <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale%20Strikers%20%281977%E2%80%9383%29">Fort Lauderdale Strikers</a>. "<a href="Bayern-luck">Bayerndusel</a>" was coined during this period as an expression of either contempt or envy about the sometimes narrow and last-minute wins against other teams.
From FC Breitnigge to FC Hollywood (1970s–1990s).
The 1980s were a period of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in personnel and financial problems. On the field, <a href="Paul%20Breitner">Paul Breitner</a> and <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Rummenigge">Karl-Heinz Rummenigge</a>, termed "FC Breitnigge", led the team to Bundesliga titles in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Bundesliga">1980</a> and <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Bundesliga">1981</a>. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20DFB-Pokal">1982</a>, two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired, and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in <a href="DFB-Pokal%201983%E2%80%9384">1984</a> and went on to win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">1986</a>. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern, though, finished as runner-up in the European Cups of <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20European%20Cup">1982</a> and <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20European%20Cup">1987</a>.
<a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> was hired as coach in 1987, but after two consecutive championships in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Bundesliga">1988–89</a> and <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Bundesliga">1989–90</a>, Bayern's form dipped. After finishing second in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Bundesliga">1990–91</a>, the club finished just five points above the relegation places in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Bundesliga">1991–92</a>. In <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">1993–94</a>, Bayern was eliminated in the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> second round to <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> side <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>, who were the only English club to beat Bayern at the Olympiastadion during Bayern's time playing there. Franz Beckenbauer took over for the second half of the 1993–94 season, winning the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Bundesliga">championship</a> again after a four-year gap. Beckenbauer was then appointed club president.
His successors as coach, <a href="Giovanni%20Trapattoni">Giovanni Trapattoni</a> and <a href="Otto%20Rehhagel">Otto Rehhagel</a>, both finished trophyless after a season, not meeting the club's high expectations. During this time, Bayern's players frequently appeared in the gossip pages of the press rather than the sports pages, resulting in the nickname "FC Hollywood". Franz Beckenbauer briefly returned at the end of the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Bundesliga">1995–96</a> season as caretaker coach and led his team to victory in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, beating <a href="FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> in the <a href="1996%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">final</a>. For the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">1996–97 season</a>, Trapattoni returned to win <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Bundesliga">the championship</a>. In the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">following season</a>, Bayern lost <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Bundesliga">the title</a> to newly promoted <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a> and Trapattoni had to take his leave for the second time.
Renewed international success (1990s–2000s).
After his success at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were coached by <a href="Ottmar%20Hitzfeld">Ottmar Hitzfeld</a> from 1998 to 2004. In Hitzfeld's <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">first season</a>, Bayern won the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> and came close to winning the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, losing 2–1 to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> into injury time after leading for most of the <a href="1999%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">match</a>. The following year, in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">the club's centenary season</a>, Bayern won the third <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Bundesliga">league</a> and <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20DFB-Pokal">cup</a> <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> in its history. A third consecutive <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> title followed in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2001</a>, won with a <a href="stoppage%20time">stoppage time</a> goal on the final day of the league season. Days later, Bayern won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> for the fourth time after a 25-year gap, defeating <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> on <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a>. The <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2001–02 season</a> began with a win in the <a href="2001%20Intercontinental%20Cup">Intercontinental Cup</a>, but ended trophyless otherwise. In <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2002–03</a>, Bayern won their fourth double, leading the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Bundesliga">league</a> by a record margin of 16 points. Hitzfeld's reign ended in 2004, with Bayern underperforming, including defeat by second division <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Alemannia Aachen</a> in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>.
<a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a> took over and led Bayern to two consecutive <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">doubles</a>. Prior to the start of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06 season</a>, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz Arena</a>, which the club shared with 1860 Munich. On the field, their performance in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07</a> was erratic. Trailing in the league and having lost to Alemannia Aachen in the cup yet again, coach Magath was sacked shortly after the winter break.
Hitzfeld returned as a trainer in January 2007, but Bayern finished the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07 season</a> in fourth position, meaning no <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> qualification for the first time in more than a decade. Additional losses in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> and the <a href="2007%20DFB-Ligapokal">DFB-Ligapokal</a> left the club with no honours for the season.
Robbery – Robben and Ribery, with foreign coaches (2000s–2010s).
For the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2007–08 season</a>, Bayern made drastic squad changes to help rebuild. Among new signings were <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a> players such as <a href="Franck%20Rib%C3%A9ry">Franck Ribéry</a>, <a href="Miroslav%20Klose">Miroslav Klose</a> and <a href="Luca%20Toni">Luca Toni</a>. Bayern won the Bundesliga in convincing fashion, leading the standings on every single week of play, and the <a href="2008%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">DFB-Pokal</a> against Borussia Dortmund. After the season, Bayern's long-term goalkeeper <a href="Oliver%20Kahn">Oliver Kahn</a> retired, which left the club without a top-tier goalkeeper for several seasons. The club's coach <a href="Ottmar%20Hitzfeld">Ottmar Hitzfeld</a> also retired and <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann">Jürgen Klinsmann</a> was chosen as his successor. However, Klinsmann was sacked before the end of his first season as Bayern trailed <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">Wolfsburg</a> in the league, had lost the quarterfinal of the DFB-Pokal to <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a>, and were defeated in the quarterfinal of the Champions League by <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, conceding four goals in the first half of the first leg. <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> was named caretaker coach and led the club to a second-place finish in the league.
For the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2009–10 season</a>, Bayern hired Dutch manager <a href="Louis%20van%20Gaal">Louis van Gaal</a>, and Dutch forward <a href="Arjen%20Robben">Arjen Robben</a> joined Bayern. Robben, alongside Ribéry, would go on to shape Bayern's playstyle of attacking over the wings for the next ten years. The press quickly dubbed the duo "Robbery". In addition, <a href="David%20Alaba">David Alaba</a> and <a href="Thomas%20M%C3%BCller">Thomas Müller</a> were promoted to the first team. Van Gaal stated: "With me, Müller always plays", which has become a much-referenced phrase over the years. On the pitch, Bayern had its most successful season since 2001, securing the domestic double and losing only in the <a href="2010%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a> of the Champions League to Inter Milan. Van Gaal was fired in April 2011 as Bayern was trailing in the league and eliminated in the first <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase">knockout round of the Champions League</a>, again by Inter.
Heynckes returned for his second permanent spell in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2011–12</a> season. Although the club had signed <a href="Manuel%20Neuer">Manuel Neuer</a>, ending Bayern's quest for an adequate substitute for Kahn, and <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Boateng">Jérôme Boateng</a> for the season, Bayern remained without a title for a second consecutive season, coming in second to Borussia Dortmund in the league and the cup. The <a href="2012%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">Champions League final</a> was held at the <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz Arena</a> and Bayern reached the final in their home stadium but lost to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> on penalties. Bayern Munich went on to win all titles in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2012–13</a>. They set various Bundesliga records along the way, becoming the first German team to win the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a>. Bayern finished the Bundesliga on 91 points, only eleven points shy of a perfect season. In what was Bayern's third <a href="2013%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">Champions League final</a> appearance within four years, they beat Borussia Dortmund 2–1. A week later, they completed the treble by winning the <a href="2013%20DFB-Pokal%20final">DFB-Pokal final</a> against <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>. During the season, the club announced that they would hire <a href="Pep%20Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> as coach for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2013–14 season</a>. Originally, the club presented this as Heynckes retiring on the expiration of his contract, but <a href="Uli%20Hoene%C3%9F">Uli Hoeneß</a> later admitted that it was not Heynckes's decision to leave Bayern at the end of the season. It was actually forced by the club's desire to appoint Guardiola.
Guardiola's first season started off well, with Bayern extending a streak of undefeated league matches from the previous season to 53 matches. An eventual loss to <a href="FC%20Augsburg">Augsburg</a> came two match days after Bayern had won the league title. During the season, Bayern had also claimed two other titles, the <a href="2013%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a> and the <a href="2013%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>, the latter being the last major trophy the club had not yet won. Bayern also won the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20DFB-Pokal">cup</a> to complete their tenth domestic double, but lost in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase">semi-final of the Champions League</a> to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>. Off the pitch, Bayern's president <a href="Uli%20Hoene%C3%9F">Uli Hoeneß</a> was convicted of tax evasion in March 2014, and sentenced to three and a half years in prison. Hoeneß resigned the next day, and vice-president <a href="Karl%20Hopfner">Karl Hopfner</a> was elected president in May. Under Guardiola, Bayern also won the Bundesliga in <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15</a> and <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16</a>, including another double in 2015–16, but did not advance past the semi-finals in the Champions League. Although the club's leadership tried to convince Guardiola to stay, the coach decided not to extend his three-year contract.
<a href="Carlo%20Ancelotti">Carlo Ancelotti</a> was hired as successor to Guardiola. Off the pitch, <a href="Uli%20Hoene%C3%9F">Uli Hoeneß</a> had been released early from prison and reelected as president in November 2016. Under Ancelotti, Bayern won a fifth consecutive league title. In July 2017, Bayern announced that <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a> would leave the <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz</a> for good as the club had been relegated to the fourth-tier <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a>. During the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2017–18 season</a>, Bayern's performances were perceived to be increasingly lacklustre, and Ancelotti was sacked after a 3–0 loss to <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">Paris St. Germain</a> in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, early in his second season. <a href="Willy%20Sagnol">Willy Sagnol</a> took over as interim manager for a week, before Jupp Heynckes was announced as coach for the rest of the season, in what was his fourth spell at the club. During the season, the club urged Heynckes—even publicly—to extend his contract, but Heynckes, aged 73, stayed firm that he would retire after the season. Heynckes led the club to another championship, but lost the cup final against <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>. Eintracht's coach, <a href="Niko%20Kova%C4%8D">Niko Kovač</a>, was named Heynckes' successor at Bayern. In Kovač's first season at Bayern, the club was eliminated by <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase">round of 16</a> in the Champions League, the first time since 2011 that Bayern did not reach the quarter-final. Bayern won their seventh straight Bundesliga title, however, as they finished two points above Dortmund with 78 points. This Bundesliga title was Ribéry's ninth and Robben's eighth. A week later, Bayern defeated <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> 3–0 in the <a href="2019%20DFB-Pokal%20final">2019 DFB-Pokal final</a> to win their 19th German Cup and to complete their 12th domestic double.
Return to German coaches (2019–).
Kovač was sacked after a 5–1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt, with <a href="Hansi%20Flick">Hansi Flick</a> being promoted to interim manager in November 2019. After a satisfying spell as interim, Bayern announced a month later that Flick would remain in charge. Under Flick, the club won the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bundesliga">league</a>, having played the most successful second half of a Bundesliga season in history, winning all but one match, which was drawn. The club also won the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20DFB-Pokal">cup</a>, completing the club's 13th domestic double. In the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, Bayern reached their first final since 2013, having beaten Barcelona <a href="FC%20Barcelona%202%E2%80%938%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich">8–2</a> in the quarter-finals. Bayern defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1–0 in the <a href="2020%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a>, which was held in Lisbon <a href="Behind%20closed%20doors%20%28sport%29%23COVID-19%20pandemic%27">behind closed doors</a> due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Europe">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Former PSG player <a href="Kingsley%20Coman">Kingsley Coman</a> scored the only goal of the match. Bayern became the second European club to complete the <a href="Continental%20Treble">seasonal treble</a> in two different seasons, matching Barcelona. Bayern started the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2020–21 season</a> by winning the <a href="2020%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> for the second time in their history. Bayern also won the <a href="2020%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>, defeating Mexican team <a href="Tigres%20UANL">Tigres</a> 1–0 in the final. Bayern became the second club to win the <a href="Sextuple%20%28association%20football%29">sextuple</a>, after Barcelona did so in 2009. The club also won its <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Bundesliga">ninth Bundesliga</a> title in a row. During the season, <a href="Robert%20Lewandowski">Robert Lewandowski</a> broke <a href="Gerd%20M%C3%BCller">Gerd Müller</a>'s record for most goals scored in a Bundesliga season, having scored 41 times in 29 matches.
Flick left at the end of the 2020–21 season to manage the Germany national team, and at Flick's request, <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> manager <a href="Julian%20Nagelsmann">Julian Nagelsmann</a> succeeded him. According to several news reports, Bayern paid Leipzig €25m as compensation for Nagelsmann's services, a world record for a manager. Under Nagelsmann, Bayern won its 10th consecutive Bundesliga title. In March 2023, Nagelsmann was released by Bayern and replaced with <a href="Thomas%20Tuchel">Thomas Tuchel</a>, who led the club to a record <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Bundesliga">eleventh consecutive title</a>, after winning a close title race with <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. In August 2023, Bayern broke the <a href="Bundesliga%20records%20and%20statistics%23Finances">German transfer record</a> again, signing <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> captain and all-time leading goalscorer <a href="Harry%20Kane">Harry Kane</a> from <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> for a reported fee of €110m.
Kits.
In the original club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905 when Bayern joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers would have to play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which were meant as an insult. For most of the club's early history, Bayern had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">1968–69 season</a>, Bayern changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">1973–74 season</a>, the team switched to an all-white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, Bayern has mostly worn an all-red home kit with white trim. Bayern revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour for the first time when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, Bayern returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and, in 2000, the club released a traditional all-red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches. Bayern also wore a "Rotwein"-coloured home kit in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2006–07 Champions League</a> campaign, in reference to their first-choice colours prior to the late 1960s.
The club's away kit has had a wide range of colours, including white, black, blue, and gold-green. Bayern also features a distinct international kit. During the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20season">2013–14 season</a>, Bayern used an all-red home kit with a <a href="Flag%20of%20Bavaria">Bavarian flag</a> diamond watermark pattern, a "<a href="Lederhosen">Lederhosen</a>"-inspired white and black "<a href="Oktoberfest">Oktoberfest</a>" away kit, and an all-navy blue international kit.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Bayern used a special away kit when playing at <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a>, representing the <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazilian</a> colours blue and yellow, a <a href="superstition">superstition</a> borne from the fact that the club found it hard to win there.
Crest.
Bayern's crest has changed several times. Originally it consisted of the stylised letters F, C, B, M, which were woven into one symbol. The original crest was blue. The colours of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> were included for the first time in 1954. The crest from 1919 to 1924 denotes "Bayern FA", whereby "FA" stands for "Fußball-Abteilung", i.e., Football Department; Bayern then was integrated into TSV Jahn Munich and constituted its football department.
The modern version of the crest has changed from the 1954 version in several steps. While the crest consisted of a single colour only for most of the time, namely blue or red, the current crest is blue, red, and white. It has the colours of Bavaria in its centre, and FC Bayern München is written in white on a red ring enclosing the Bavarian colours.
Stadiums.
Bayern played its first training games at the Schyrenplatz in the centre of <a href="Munich">Munich</a>. The first official games were held on the <a href="Theresienwiese">Theresienwiese</a>. In 1901, Bayern moved to a field of its own, located in <a href="Schwabing">Schwabing</a> at the <a href="Clemensstra%C3%9Fe">Clemensstraße</a>. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, Bayern moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße. As the crowds gathering for Bayern's home games increased at the beginning of the 1920s, Bayern had to switch to various other premises in Munich.
From 1925, Bayern shared the <a href="Gr%C3%BCnwalder%20Stadion">Grünwalder Stadion</a> with <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a>. Until the Second World War, the stadium was owned by 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as "Sechz'ger" ("Sixties") Stadium. It was destroyed during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> in the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Oberliga">1961–62</a> season. In the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> era, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000, which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272. As was the case at most of this period's stadiums, the vast majority of the stadium was given over to terracing. Since 1995, the second teams and youth teams of both clubs played in the stadium.
For the <a href="1972%20Summer%20Olympics">1972 Summer Olympics</a>, the city of Munich built the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Munich%29">Olympiastadion</a>. The stadium, renowned for its architecture, was inaugurated in the last Bundesliga match of the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Bundesliga">1971–72</a> season. The match drew a capacity crowd of 79,000, a total which was reached again on numerous occasions. In its early days, the stadium was considered one of the foremost stadiums in the world, and played host to numerous major finals, such as that of the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 FIFA World Cup</a>. In the following years, the stadium underwent several modifications, such as an increase in seating space from approximately 50 per cent to 66 per cent. Eventually, the stadium had a capacity of 63,000 for national matches and 59,000 for international occasions such as European Cup competitions. Many people, however, began to feel that the stadium was too cold in winter, with half the audience exposed to the weather due to lack of cover. A further complaint was the distance between the spectators and the pitch, betraying the stadium's track and field heritage. Renovation proved impossible, as the architect <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20Behnisch">Günther Behnisch</a> vetoed major modifications of the stadium.
After much discussion, the city of Munich, the state of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, Bayern Munich and <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a> jointly decided at the end of 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a purpose-built football stadium for several years, the awarding of the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of Munich, the <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz Arena</a> has been in use since the beginning of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06</a> season. Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier, increasing the capacity to 71,000. In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council, with the Allianz Arena holding a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).
The stadium's most prominent feature is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for effects. Red lighting is used for Bayern home games and white for <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">German national team</a> home games.
In May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.
Supporters.
At the 2018 annual general meeting, the Bayern board reported that the club had 291,000 official members and 4,433 officially registered fan clubs with over 390,000 members. This made the club the <a href="List%20of%20sports%20clubs%20by%20membership">largest fan membership club</a> in the world. Bayern has an average of 75,000 fans at the Allianz Arena which is at 100 per cent capacity level. Every Bundesliga game has been sold-out for years. Bayern's away games have also been sold out for many years. According to a study by Sport+Markt from 2010, Bayern is the fifth-most popular football club in Europe with 20.7 million supporters, ranking first of all German clubs.
The club's most prominent <a href="Ultras">ultra</a> groups are "Schickeria München", "Inferno Bavaria", "Red Munichs '89", "Südkurve '73", "Munichmaniacs 1996", "Red Angels", and "Red Sharks". The ultras scene of Bayern Munch has been recognised for certain groups taking stance against right-wing extremism, racism and homophobia, and in 2014 the group Schickeria München received the Julius Hirsch Award by the DFB for its commitment against antisemitism and discrimination.
Since 1973 Bayern Munich have had a fan friendship in with <a href="VFL%20Bochum">VFL Bochum</a> which is the longest in the Bundesliga.
<a href="Stern%20des%20S%C3%BCdens">Stern des Südens</a> is the song which fans sing at FCB home games. In the 1990s, they also used to sing "FC Bayern, Forever Number One". Another notable song is "Mia San Mia" (<a href="Bavarian%20language">Bavarian</a> for "we are who we are"), which is a well-known motto of the club as well. A renowned <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a> for the team is ""Packmas", which is a Bavarian phrase for the German "Packen wir es"", which means "let's do it". The club's <a href="mascot">mascot</a> is "Berni" since 2004.
The club also has had a number of high-profile supporters, among them <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>, <a href="Boris%20Becker">Boris Becker</a>, <a href="Wladimir%20Klitschko">Wladimir Klitschko</a>, <a href="Horst%20Seehofer">Horst Seehofer</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Stoiber">Edmund Stoiber</a>, former <a href="List%20of%20Ministers-President%20of%20Bavaria">Minister-President</a> of Bavaria.
Rivalries.
Bayern is one of three professional football clubs in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>. Bayern's main local rival is <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a>, who was the more successful club in the 1950s and was controversially picked for the initial Bundesliga season in 1963, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division. The <a href="Munich%20derby">Munich derby</a> is still a much-anticipated event, getting much extra attention from supporters of both clubs. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.
Since the 1920s, <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> has been Bayern's main and traditional rival in Bavaria. <a href="Philipp%20Lahm">Philipp Lahm</a> said that playing Nürnberg is "always special" and is a "heated atmosphere". Both clubs played in the same league in the mid-1920s, but in the 1920s and 1930s, Nürnberg was far more successful, winning five <a href="German%20football%20champions">championships</a> in the 1920s, making the club Germany's record champion. Bayern took over the title more than sixty years later, when they won their tenth championship in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Bundesliga">1987</a>, thereby surpassing the number of championships won by Nürnberg. The duel between Bayern and Nürnberg is often referred to as the <a href="Bavarian%20football%20derbys%23The%20Bavarian%20derby">Bavarian Derby</a>.
Bayern also has a strong rivalry with the <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a>, originating in parts from a game in 1973, when Bayern lost 7–4 after leading 4–1, but also from the two clubs competing for German championship honours at various times in the Bundesliga, as well as the city of <a href="Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a>, together with the surrounding <a href="Palatinate%20%28region%29">Palatinate</a>, having been part of Bavaria until the end of the Second World War.
Since the 1970s, Bayern's main rivals have been the clubs who put up the strongest fight against its national dominance. In the 1970s, this was <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, in the 1980s, the category expanded to include <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>. In the 1990s, <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> and <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> emerged as the most ardent opponents. Since the 2000s, <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, and Werder Bremen have been the main challengers in the Bundesliga. Bayern and Dortmund also have played against each other in the DFB-Pokal final in <a href="2008%20DFB-Pokal%20final">2008</a>, <a href="2012%20DFB-Pokal%20final">2012</a>, <a href="2014%20DFB-Pokal%20final">2014</a>, and <a href="2016%20DFB-Pokal%20final">2016</a>. The 5–2 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 final was Bayern's worst ever loss in a DFB-Pokal final. The highlight of the rivalry between the two clubs was when Bayern defeated Dortmund 2–1 in the <a href="2013%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">final</a> of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2012–13 UEFA Champions League</a>.

Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches. Due to Bayern being traditionally hard to beat for Madrid, Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the "Bestia negra" ("Black Beast"). Despite the number of duels, Bayern and Real have never met in the final of a Champions League or European Cup.
Organization and finance.
Bayern is mostly led by former club players. From 2016 to 2019, <a href="Uli%20Hoene%C3%9F">Uli Hoeneß</a> served as the club's president, following <a href="Karl%20Hopfner">Karl Hopfner</a> who had been in office from 2014; Hoeneß had resigned in 2014 after being convicted of tax fraud. <a href="Oliver%20Kahn">Oliver Kahn</a> was chairman of the executive board of the AG.

Adidas acquired its shares in 2002 for €77 million. The money was designated to help finance the <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz Arena</a>. In 2009, Audi paid €90 million for their share. The capital was used to repay the loan on the Allianz Arena. And in early 2014, Allianz became the third shareholder of the company acquiring theirs share for €110 million. With the sale, Bayern paid off the remaining debt on the Allianz Arena 16 years ahead of schedule. Bayern's other sports departments are run by the club.
Bayern's shirt sponsor is <a href="Deutsche%20Telekom">Deutsche Telekom</a>. Deutsche Telekom has been Bayern's shirt sponsor since the start of 2002–03 season. The company extended their sponsorship deal in August 2015 until the end of the 2026–27 season.

Bayern is an exception in professional football, having generated profits for 27 consecutive years. Other clubs often report losses, realising transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses <a href="current%20asset">current asset</a>s. In the 2019 edition of the <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">Deloitte Football Money League</a>, Bayern had the fourth-highest revenue in club football, generating revenue of €629.2 million.

While other European clubs have mainly marketed to international audiences, Bayern had focused on Germany. Since the 2010s, Bayern have started to focus their marketing more on <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Bayern made summer tours to the United States in 2014 and 2016. Bayern went to <a href="China">China</a> in the summer of 2015 and returned in the summer of 2017, where they also played games in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>.

In March 2017, Bayern was the first foreign football club to open an office in mainland China.
Social engagement and charity.
Bayern has been involved with charitable ventures for a long time, helping other football clubs in financial disarray as well as ordinary people in misery. In the wake of the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake">2004 Indian ocean Tsunami</a> the "FC Bayern – Hilfe e.V." was founded, a foundation that aims to concentrate the social engagements of the club. At its inception, this venture was funded with €600,000, raised by officials and players of the club. The money was, amongst other things, used to build a school in Marathenkerny, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, and to rebuild the area of <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a>, Sri Lanka.
The club has also assisted other sport clubs in financial disarray. The club has supported its local rival <a href="TSV%201860%20M%C3%BCnchen">1860 Munich</a> with player transfers at favourable rates and direct money transfers. When <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">St. Pauli</a> threatened to lose its licence for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game, giving all <a href="gate%20receipts">gate receipts</a> to St. Pauli. In 1993, <a href="Alexander%20Zickler">Alexander Zickler</a> transferred from <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden">Dynamo Dresden</a> to Bayern for 2.3 Million <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">DM</a>, with many considering the sum to have been a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a €2 Million loan to the nearly bankrupt <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. In 2009, <a href="Mark%20van%20Bommel">Mark van Bommel</a>'s home club <a href="Fortuna%20Sittard">Fortuna Sittard</a> was in financial distress; Bayern played a charity game at the Dutch club, gifting them gate receipts. In 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division side <a href="FC%20Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a>. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence. In 2017, Bayern played a benefit match against financial troubled <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a>, with all gate receipts going to Kickers Offenbach. Two years later, Bayern played a benefit match against Kaiserslautern. The match was played so Kaiserslautern could secure their licence to play in the German third division. All income from the match went to Kaiserslautern. In March 2020, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Bayer Leverkusen, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019–20 season, collectively gave €20 million to Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>.
In mid-2013, Bayern was the first club to give financial support to the <a href="Magnus%20Hirschfeld%23Legacy">Magnus Hirschfeld National Foundation</a>. The foundation researches the living environment <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> people, and developed an education concept to facilitate unbiased dealing with LGBT themes in football. In 2016, Bayern received the Nine Values Cup, an award of the international children's social programme <a href="Football%20for%20Friendship">Football for Friendship</a>.

Hannover 96 has a <a href="Lower%20Saxony%20derby">long-standing rivalry</a> with <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a>.
History.
Foundation to the Second World War.
The club was founded on 12 April 1896 as Hannoverscher Fußball-Club 1896, upon the suggestion of <a href="Ferdinand-Wilhelm%20Fricke">Ferdinand-Wilhelm Fricke</a>, founder of the <a href="Deutscher%20FV%201878%20Hannover">Deutscher FV 1878 Hannover</a>. Their initial enthusiasm was for athletics and <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a>; football did not become their primary interest until 1899. Most of the membership of Germania 1902 Hannover became part of 96 in 1902, while others of the club formed Hannoverscher Ballspielverein. In 1913, they merged with Ballverein 1898 Hannovera (formed in the 1905 merger of Fußballverein Hannovera, 1898 Hannover, and Hannoverscher BV) to become Hannoverscher Sportverein 1896. Hannoverscher FC's colours were black-white-green, but they played in blue, while BV played in red. The newly united team kept black-white-green as the club colours, but they chose to take to the field in red, giving the team the nickname "Die Roten" ("The Reds"). The team's third jersey is in the club's official colours. The club made regular appearances in the national playoffs through the early 1900s, but was unable to progress past <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a>, planting the seeds of a rivalry that has survived to this day. HSV continued to field strong sides and make national level appearances on into the 1920s. During <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi rule</a>, German football was re-organized into 16 top-flight leagues in 1933 and Hannover became part of the <a href="Gauliga%20Niedersachsen">Gauliga Niedersachsen</a>. They appeared in the country's final rounds in 1935 and sent representatives to the national side the next year. They won their first national championship in 1938, in what was one of the biggest upsets in German football history, when they beat <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, the most dominant side in the country in the era. The two sides played to a 3–3 draw before Hannover prevailed 4–3 in a tension-filled re-match. In 1942, the team moved to the newly formed <a href="Gauliga%20Braunschweig-S%C3%BCdhannover">Gauliga Braunschweig-Südhannover</a>.
Post-War era.
In common with most other German organizations, the club was dissolved after the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> by occupying Allied authorities. A combined local side was assembled in August 1945 and the next month a mixed group of players from Hannover 96 and Arminia Hannover played their first post-war match against a British military team. HSV was later formally re-established as Hannoverscher SV on 11 November 1945, before re-adopting its traditional name on 27 April 1946. The club resumed league play in 1947 in the first division <a href="Oberliga%20Nord%20%281947-63%29">Oberliga Nord</a> and was relegated, but quickly returned to the top-flight in 1949. Hannover 96's next appearance in a national final would not come until 1954 when they soundly defeated <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> 5–1. The beaten side included five of the same players who would go on later that year to win Germany's first <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> in a surprise victory known as the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20final">Miracle of Bern</a>. In 1963, the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional football league, began play with 16 of the nation's top teams. Hannover played in the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga Nord</a> (II) that season, but earned promotion to the senior circuit in the following year. The club's advance to the Bundesliga in 1964 was well received, as they set a league attendance record in their first year, averaging 46,000 spectators a game. 96 played at the upper level for a decade, until they were relegated to the <a href="2nd%20Bundesliga%20Nord%20%281974%E2%80%9381%29">2nd Bundesliga Nord</a> for the 1974–75 season. They bounced right back, but again went down, this time to spend 17 of the next 20 years in the second tier.
Reunification to present.
The club suffered from financial problems in the late 1970s and again in the early 1990s. Then, in 1992, Hannover put together a run that would lead them to the capture of their first <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> and help to secure stable finances. That run included victories over Bundesliga sides <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a>, <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a>, <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> and <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, as they became the first lower division side to win the competition. The team's low point came with demotion to <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a> (III) for two years in 1996–98.
Hannover made a fresh start with a new team, many of whom went on to play for the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">national team</a> – notably <a href="Gerald%20Asamoah">Gerald Asamoah</a>, <a href="Sebastian%20Kehl">Sebastian Kehl</a> and <a href="Fabian%20Ernst">Fabian Ernst</a>. 96 returned to tier II play in 1998, and to the Bundesliga in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%202.%20Bundesliga">2002</a> on the strength of a record-setting 75-point season. Since their promotion, the club have consolidated in the top flight, achieving a string of mid-table finishes under the command of several managers. Coach <a href="Dieter%20Hecking">Dieter Hecking</a> was brought in just weeks into the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07 season</a> after a disastrous start under <a href="Peter%20Neururer">Peter Neururer</a>, in which the club lost the first three matches by a combined 11 goals. The <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a> showed some early promise, with impressive pre-season wins over <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> and <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>. However, they earned mixed results in their opening six Bundesliga matches. The team then put together a three match winning run, capped by a 2–0 win at champions <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>, to surge into the top six. Following the winter break, Hannover slipped after putting forth some disappointing performances which they turned around to be defeated only two times in their last 11 matches of the season. This secured a points record of 49 for "Die Roten" in the Bundesliga, thus ending them in eighth place.
The <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Bundesliga">2008–09 season</a> started undesirably for Hannover with losses. However, it looked to have been rectified with a 5–1 thrashing of Borussia Mönchengladbach, a shock 1–0 win over <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> at home, which had not occurred for 20 years, and a thrilling 3–0 victory over <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>. Hannover settled in the lower-mid-table until the winter break. The second half of the season consisted of inconsistent results, relying almost entirely on home form to keep Hannover in the top league. The club finally achieved an away win with a few games remaining which boosted them from trouble and stabilized them, leading to an 11th-place finish. The season was one of inconsistent form and long injuries to key players.
The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Bundesliga">2009–10 season</a> was launched with new optimism, with a new kit being released which included traditional away and alternative kits. Hannover also signed a new technical director in <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Schmadtke">Jörg Schmadtke</a>, who brought a new perspective to the club. New signings were <a href="Karim%20Haggui">Karim Haggui</a> and <a href="Constant%20Djakpa">Constant Djakpa</a> from <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a>, <a href="Valdet%20Rama">Valdet Rama</a> from <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">FC Ingolstadt</a>. The season started undesirably with a late 1–0 loss to <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> and a disappointing home draw to <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">Mainz 05</a>, after which coach <a href="Dieter%20Hecking">Dieter Hecking</a> resigned voluntarily. He was succeeded by former assistant <a href="Andreas%20Bergmann">Andreas Bergmann</a>. As the season continued, Hannover again had many key players injured, including the majority of attacking players and key defenders, as well as this occurred the <a href="Hannover%2096%23Death%20of%20Robert%20Enke">suicide of Robert Enke</a>, Hannover's German international goalkeeper. Andreas Bergmann was removed as coach and replaced by Mirko Slomka shortly after the winter break. <a href="Arouna%20Kon%C3%A9">Arouna Koné</a> and <a href="%C3%89lson%20Falc%C3%A3o%20da%20Silva">Elson</a> were signed to boost the squad. Hannover 96 spent the majority of the year in the relegation zone, and with a few wins in the last games of the season, Hannover had to win and hope results went their way for them. Hannover won 3–0, with <a href="Arnold%20Bruggink">Arnold Bruggink</a>, <a href="Mike%20Hanke">Mike Hanke</a> and <a href="S%C3%A9rgio%20Pinto%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201980%29">Sérgio Pinto</a> all scoring to keep them in the Bundesliga.
In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a>, Hannover finished in fourth place, qualifying for Europe for the first time in 19 years. In <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Bundesliga">2011–12</a>, the team opened with a 2–1 win over <a href="TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim">1899 Hoffenheim</a>, followed by a 2–1 away win against <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>. In the play-offs to the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>, Hannover won against <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> 3–2 on aggregate to reach the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20group%20stage">group stage</a>. Shortly before the end of the 2011–12 season, Hannover Technical Director <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Schmadtke">Jörg Schmadtke</a> resigned due to family issues.
Hannover finished bottom of the Bundesliga in the 2015–16 season and were relegated to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. The club chose to keep the majority of their first-team squad together. However, after a good start to the 2016–17 season, a poor run of form prompted the club's board to sack manager <a href="Daniel%20Stendel">Daniel Stendel</a>, and appoint <a href="Andre%20Breitenreiter">Andre Breitenreiter</a> as their new manager. He led the team to seven wins in the final 11 games, helping the 96ers secure second place behind <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> and bounce back to the top flight at the first attempt.
Adverse publicity resulted for the club when a large contingent of ultras travelled to <a href="England">England</a> for a 2017–18 pre-season game against <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a>. They caused trouble in the town centre prior to the game. Once inside <a href="Turf%20Moor">Turf Moor</a> they responded to a brief altercation on the pitch after 40 minutes by charging the home fans, tearing out seats and using them as missiles. On police advice the game was abandoned at half-time, with Hannover 96 trailing 1–0.
Death of Robert Enke.
On 10 November 2009, at the age of 32, Hannover's first-choice goalkeeper <a href="Robert%20Enke">Robert Enke</a> died as a result of suicide after he stood in front of a regional express train at a <a href="level%20crossing">level crossing</a> in <a href="Eilvese">Eilvese</a>, <a href="Neustadt%20am%20R%C3%BCbenberge">Neustadt am Rübenberge</a>. Police confirmed a suicide note had been found, but did not publicise its details. His widow, Teresa, revealed that her husband had been suffering from <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a> for six years and was treated by a psychiatrist. After the death of his daughter Lara in 2006, he struggled to cope with the loss.
Upon news breaking of what had happened, many fans immediately gathered at Hannover 96's <a href="AWD-Arena">AWD-Arena</a> home, where they laid flowers, lit candles and signed a <a href="Condolence%20book">book of condolence</a>. His former club <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> held a minute's silence before their game that night, and several international matches the following weekend paid the same tribute. As a mark of respect, the German national team cancelled their friendly match against <a href="Chile%20national%20football%20team">Chile</a>, which had been scheduled for 14 November. A minute's silence was also held at all Bundesliga games on 21 and 22 November 2009, as well as at <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>'s game in the <a href="Ta%C3%A7a%20de%20Portugal">Taça de Portugal</a> - Benfica was another former club of Enke's. Germany also cancelled a planned training session and all interviews after his death. <a href="Oliver%20Bierhoff">Oliver Bierhoff</a>, the national team's general manager, said, "We are all shocked. We are lost for words."
On 15 November 2009, nearly 40,000 attendees filled the AWD-Arena for his memorial service. Enke's coffin, covered in white roses, was carried by six of his Hannover 96 teammates. He was then buried in <a href="Neustadt%20am%20R%C3%BCbenberge">Neustadt</a>, outside the city of Hanover, next to his daughter's grave. As a further mark of respect for their former teammate, Hannover 96 players displayed the number one in a circle on the breast of their jerseys, as approved by the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFL), as a subtle tribute for the rest of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Bundesliga">2009–10 season</a>.
Stadium.
Hannover 96 plays in the <a href="HDI-Arena">HDI-Arena</a>, built in 1954 as the "Niedersachsenstadion", which now has a capacity of 49,000 spectators. Before the year 2013, the arena was called "AWD-Arena". But after changing the sponsor the stadium name was changed to "HDI-Arena". During the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a>, the stadium was the site of four first round matches and one Round of 16 match. The stadium had also served as a site for matches in the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%201974">1974 World Cup</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201988">UEFA Euro 1988</a>.

Karlsruher SC

Karlsruher Sport-Club Mühlburg-Phönix e. V. better known as Karlsruher SC is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a>, based in <a href="Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a>, <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a> that currently plays in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, the second tier of German football. Domestically, the club was crowned German champion in 1909, and won the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> in 1955 and 1956. In Europe, KSC won the <a href="1996%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a> in 1996, which remains the club's last major honor.
Formed as Karlsruher Fussball Club Phönix in 1894, the modern form of the club was formed as the result of several mergers in 1952, and its early success granted KSC a spot in the <a href="1963-64%20Bundesliga">inaugural Bundesliga season</a> in 1963. KSC spent the next few decades as a <a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo club</a> frequently being promoted and relegated between the top two divisions, with their best <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> season coming in 1996 when KSC finished 6th in the table. Relegation followed in 1998, and the club has since spent all but two seasons between the second and <a href="3.%20Liga">third tiers.</a> KSC maintains a fierce rivalry with <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>, in which old <a href="Badenese">Badenese</a>-<a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a>ian animosities are played out.
History.
A succession of mergers.
The most successful of these ancestral clubs was Karlsruher Fussball Club Phönix, formed on 6 June 1894 by dissatisfied members of the gymnastics club Karlsruher Turngemeinde. They quickly became a strong regional side, playing in the <a href="S%C3%BCdkreis-Liga">Südkreis-Liga</a>, and won the national title in 1909, defeating defending champions <a href="BFC%20Viktoria%201889">Viktoria 89 Berlin</a> 4–2 in the championship final that season. In 1912, Phönix merged with KFC Alemannia, established in 1897, to create KFC Phönix (Phönix Alemannia).
 It was as Phönix Karlsruhe that the club joined the <a href="Gauliga%20Baden">Gauliga Baden</a>, one of 16 top-flight divisions created in the re-organization of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>. They slipped from the first division for a single season in 1936, but returned to compete as a mediocre side over the next several years. In the 1943–44 season, Karlsruhe played with Germania Durlach as the combined wartime side named KSG (Kriegssportgemeinschaft) Phönix/Germania Karlsruhe. After World War II in 1946, Phönix re-emerged to compete in the newly formed first division Oberliga Süd, finishing 15th in their first season there. The club was relegated the following season.
Two other threads in the evolution of "KSC" were the formation of FC Mühlburg in 1905 out of 1. FV Sport Mühlburg (founded in 1890) and Viktoria Mühlburg (founded in 1892), and the merger of FC Germania (founded in 1898) and "FC Weststadt" (founded in 1902) to form VfB Karlsruhe in 1911. FC Mühlburg and VfB Karlsruhe would in turn merge to form VfB Mühlburg in 1933. The group of clubs which came together to form VfB Mühlburg were an undistinguished lot, sharing just one season of upper-league play between them. The new side, however, started to compete in the first-division Gauliga Baden immediately after the league was established in 1933.
A lower-table side through the 1930s, VfB's performance improved considerably in the following decade. As war overtook the country, the Gauliga Baden was sub-divided at various times into a number of more local city-based circuits and the team was able to earn three-second-place finishes in divisional play. The Gauliga Baden collapsed in 1944–45 after playing a significantly reduced schedule in which many teams, including Mühlburg were unable to compete. After the war the club slipped from top-flight competition until earning promotion to the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Süd</a> in 1947. They generally competed as a mid-table side here with the exception of a strong performance in 1951 when they narrowly missed an advance to the national championship rounds after earning a third-place result just a single point behind <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">SpVgg Fürth</a>.
The formation of Karlsruher SC.
KFC Phoenix and VfB Mühlburg united to form the Karlsruher Sport-Club Mühlburg-Phönix e. V., on 16 October 1952 and the new team earned good results throughout the remainder of the decade. In 1955, they beat <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> 3–2 to win the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, and repeated the success next year with a 3–1 win over <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>. That season, they also made an appearance in the national final, where they lost 2–4 to <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. KSC was Oberliga Süd champion in 1956, 1958 and 1960, as well as runner-up in the DFB-Pokal in 1960, when they lost the final match 2–3 to <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>. Their record earned them admission as one of sixteen founding clubs into Germany's new professional football league, the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, when it began play in 1963.
Karlsruhe struggled in the top flight, never managing better than a 13th-place finish over five seasons before finally being demoted to the second-division <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>. Over the next three seasons, the team earned a first-place finish as well as two-second-place finishes there, but were unable to advance in the promotion rounds. After the 1974 formation of the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, which consisted of two divisions at the time, KSC finished first in the 2. Bundesliga Süd and returned to the top flight for the 1975–76 season, but were able to stay up for only two years. They next returned to the first division in 1980 where they spent four seasons before being sent down again. After a two-year absence they fought their way back to the Bundesliga in 1987 to begin an extended stay.
The Schäfer era.
Under the guidance of new coach <a href="Winfried%20Sch%C3%A4fer">Winfried Schäfer</a>, KSC's return to the top flight was marked with some success as for the first time the team managed to work its way out of the bottom half of the league table. In the 1993–94 season, the club had a successful run in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, going out in the semi-finals on <a href="away%20goals">away goals</a> to <a href="SV%20Austria%20Salzburg">Austria Salzburg</a> after beating, in turn, <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a>, <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>, <a href="FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> and <a href="Boavista%20F.C.">Boavista</a>. Their stunning 7–0 second-round victory over Valencia, a top team in the Spanish <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> at the time and in historical terms as well, might be considered the high point of the club's history in its centennial year. Edgar "Euro Eddy" Schmitt scored 4 goals and became a club legend. Between 1992 and 1997, the club was ranked in the single digits in six consecutive Bundesliga seasons, and participated in two more UEFA Cups, reaching the third round both in the 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons, being eliminated from the competition after losing their second-leg matches to <a href="Br%C3%B8ndby%20IF">Brøndby</a> and <a href="FC%20Spartak%20Moscow">Spartak Moscow</a> respectively. In 1995, KSC won the <a href="DFB-Hallenpokal">DFB-Hallenpokal</a>, an indoor football tournament that was traditionally held during winter breaks of the Bundesliga seasons. They also played in the final of the DFB-Pokal in 1996, but lost 0–1 to <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a>.
As the millennium drew to a close, Karlsruhe faded. The club started the 1997–98 Bundesliga season well, with two wins and a draw in their opening three matches, but their downfall began with a 1–6 defeat to <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> on Day 4. At the league winter break the club sat outside the relegation ranks, but a series of negative results pushed them down to 15th place until the second-last matchday of the season. Schäfer was fired in March 1998, but this did not keep the club from slipping to the Second Bundesliga after a 16th-place finish. The club needed an away draw against <a href="F.C.%20Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a> on the final day of the season to avoid relegation, but lost the match 2–4 while Borussia Mönchengladbach beat <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> 2–0 to overtake KSC and finish 15th on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>.
After relegation from the Bundesliga in 1998.
KSC finished fifth in their first season in the 2. Bundesliga after relegation, only two points behind third-place <a href="SSV%20Ulm%201846">SSV Ulm 1846</a> which was promoted to the Bundesliga. However, a last place finish in a terrible 1999–2000 season played under dire financial circumstances dropped them down to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> (III). The club rebounded and on the strength of a first-place result in the Regionalliga made a prompt return to second division play. After four seasons of mediocre play that saw KSC narrowly avoid being sent further down, the team turned in a much-improved performance and earned a sixth-place result in 2005–06.
From 2007.
KSC secured the 2007 <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> title with three games left in the season by way of a 1–0 victory over <a href="SpVgg%20Unterhaching">SpVgg Unterhaching</a> on 29 April, combined with a draw by second-placed Hansa Rostock on 30 April. KSC maintained its dominance over the course of the season, playing 14 matches (nine wins, five draws) before suffering their first loss of the campaign at the hands of <a href="FC%20Erzgebirge%20Aue">Erzgebirge Aue</a>. They are the first team in the history of the single-division 2. Bundesliga to occupy the top spot throughout the whole season.
In their return season to the Bundesliga in 2007–08 they finished 11th, fading in the second half of the year after a strong start that saw them positioned in the qualifying places for <a href="UEFA">European competition</a>. The club continued to perform poorly in the 2008–09 season, ultimately finishing 17th and finding themselves relegated to the 2. Bundesliga once more. The club's two most recent campaigns there ended with 10th and 15th-place finishes. Karlsruhe finished second level as 16th and faced <a href="SSV%20Jahn%20Regensburg">Jahn Regensburg</a> with relegation play-offs. These teams draw with as 1–1 at Regensburg and as 2–2 at Karlsruhe. This meant Karlsruhe's relegation to third tier after 12 years according to <a href="away%20goal%20rule">away goal rule</a>.
The club successfully bounced back in 2012–13 when it won a championship in the 3. Liga and earned promotion back to the 2. Bundesliga.
2014–15 would see the club come close to a return to the Bundesliga, a third-place finish would see them play a promotion play-off against Hamburg, and after a 1–1 draw in Hamburg in the first leg, KSC were seconds away from promotion, only for Hamburg to score an equaliser in the 90th minute to force extra time, where they would score a winning away goal late in the second half to secure their Bundesliga status for another season.
In 2019, Karlsruhe won 4–1 against <a href="SC%20Preu%C3%9Fen%20M%C3%BCnster">Preußen Münster</a> on matchday 31, therefore returning to the 2. Bundesliga after a hiatus of two years.
Reserve team.
The <a href="Karlsruher%20SC%20II">Karlsruher SC II</a>, historically also referred to as Karlsruher SC Amateure, is a successful side in its own right, playing for many years as high up as the Regionalliga Süd. At the end of the 2011–12 season, the team was forcefully relegated to the Oberliga because of the relegation of the first team to the 3. Liga as reserve teams of 3. Liga clubs are not permitted in the Regionalliga anymore from 2012. The team had suffered a similar fate in 2000, when the first team was relegated to the Regionalliga Süd and the reserve team therefore had to leave this league despite finishing above the relegation ranks.
Between 1991 and 2000, the team also won the <a href="North%20Baden%20Cup">North Baden Cup</a> on four occasions, thereby qualifying for the first round of the DFB-Pokal on each occasion. Its greatest success in this competition was reaching the third round in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20DFB-Pokal">1996–97</a>.
After many restrained years, in which the targeted promotion was clearly missed, the already greatly reduced second team was discontinued for financial reasons at the end of the 2017–18 Oberliga season. However, KSC reopened its second team as a fans' team for the 2019–20 season and entered the Kreisklasse C, the lowest level of league football in Karlsruhe and North Baden.

History.
Foundation to World War II.
The earliest roots of the association go back to the establishment of the gymnastics club Turnverein Flingern on 5 May 1895 in the village of <a href="Flingern">Flingern</a>, today one of the eastern quarters of Düsseldorf. Two other sides figure in the club's early history: Düsseldorfer Fußballklub Spielverein, founded in 1908, and FK Alemania 1911, which was founded in 1911 and became Fortuna 1911 the following year. In mid-1912, these two clubs merged to form Düsseldorfer Fußball-Club Fortuna 1911, which played its debut season in the Westdeutschen Spielverband in 1913–14. TV Flingern joined Fortuna to create Düsseldorfer Turn- und Sportverein Fortuna on 15 November 1919.
In the late 1920s, Fortuna won its first honours as a first tier side; it captured a district level Bezirksliga title in 1927, sent its first representative to the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany national team</a> in 1928 (<a href="Ernst%20Albrecht%20%28footballer%29">Ernst Albrecht</a>), and took a second Bezirksliga title in 1929. The team continued to perform well into the 1930s, winning its third and fourth district titles en route to a <a href="Western%20German%20football%20championship">Western German football championship</a> in 1931 and its greatest success, a <a href="German%20football%20championship">German football championship</a> in 1933 against <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, which was on the verge of becoming the era's dominant side in Germany. Fortuna was the first team to win the title without conceding a goal in the final rounds of the tournament. It beat <a href="Vorw%C3%A4rts-Rasensport%20Gleiwitz">Vorwärts-Rasensport Gleiwitz</a> (9–0), <a href="Arminia%20Hannover">Arminia Hannover</a> (3–0), <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> (4–0) and finally Schalke 04 (3–0) en route to becoming the first national champion from the industrial <a href="Rhine-Ruhr">Rhine-Ruhr</a> area.
In the following season, the club began playing in <a href="Gauliga%20Niederrhein">Gauliga Niederrhein</a>, 1 of 16 top-flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>. Düsseldorf dominated the division through the 1930s as five-time champions between 1936 and 1940, and made losing appearances in the national championship final in 1936 (1–2 to <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>) and the final of the Tschammerpokal, the predecessor of today's <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, in 1937 (1–2 against Schalke 04). The club was <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">reglegated</a> in 1942, but returneed to the top flight the following season. In 1944–45, it began play as the combined wartime side Kriegsspielgemeinschaft TSV Fortuna/SC 99 Düsseldorf with partner Düsseldorfer Sport Club 1899, but took part in only two matches as <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> fell before the advance of Allied armies.
The most notable players of that era were <a href="Paul%20Janes">Paul Janes</a>, Germany's most capped player from 1942 to 1970 (71 caps), German team captian (1939–1942) and member of the Breslau Eleven that beat <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Denmark</a> 8–0 in <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a> in 1937 and went on to win 10 of 11 games played during that year; <a href="Stanislaus%20Kobierski">Stanislaus Kobierski</a>, who earned 26 caps and scored Germany's first ever <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> goal; <a href="Ernst%20Albrecht%20%28footballer%29">Ernst Albrecht</a>; and <a href="Jakob%20Bender">Jakob Bender</a>.
Post War era.
After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Allied occupation authorities ordered the dissolution of all sports organizations in Germany. Fortuna was re-formed in 1945 and then played most of their football in the <a href="Oberliga%20West">Oberliga West</a> (I) in the years between 1947 and the creation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>'s professonal football league, in 1963. It played as a lower-to-mid-table side, though it also made three appearances in the DFB-Pokal final in – 1957, 1958 and 1962 – but did not the prize, losing each of those matches to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> and 1. FC Nürnberg. It was also during this era that <a href="Toni%20Turek">Toni Turek</a>, goalkeeper for West Germany's "Miracle of Bern" side at the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954 World Cup</a>; <a href="Erich%20Juskowiak">Erich Juskowiak</a> (30 caps and World Cup player in <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958</a>); and later national team coach <a href="Jupp%20Derwall">Jupp Derwall</a> all represented Fortuna.
1960s and 1970s.
Fortuna's performance was not good enough to earn them a place among the original 16 teams chosen for the newly founded Bundesliga in 1963, but the club played its way into the premier division three years later for a cameo appearance in <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Bundesliga">1966–67</a>. Despite a sensational 2–1 away win at recent <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> winners <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> on its Bundesliga debut, Fortuna was immediately relegated, though only to return in 1971 for a stay that lasted 16 seasons and included two third-place league finishes (in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Bundesliga">1972–73</a> and <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Bundesliga">1973–74</a>). On 9 December 1978, Fortuna recorded a 7–1 victory against Bayern Munich, to date the highest away defeat for Bayern in its entire Bundesliga history. In addition, Fortuna continued its prosperous play in the DFB-Pokal, making another three appearances. After losing in its fifth appearance in the final in <a href="1978%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1978</a> against local rivals <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> (0–2), the club finally broke through and came away as champions in <a href="1979%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1979</a>, prevailing 1–0 against <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>, then repeating as champions <a href="1980%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1980</a> with 2–1 victory against 1. FC Köln. During this period, the club established a record for consecutive DFB-Pokal match victories, with 18-straight between 1978 and 1981.
Fortuna is among a group of four teams which have made frequent appearances in the DFB-Pokal final only to come away empty-handed. Like <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a>, Fortuna has just two wins against five losses. 1. FC Köln has four wins and six losses in the Cup final, while Schalke 04 has been frustrated most often, with five wins and seven losses. Four of the Düsseldorfer's losses were by a single goal and two of those were in extra time.
The club's best turn in European competition was in the <a href="1979%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1979 European Cup Winners' Cup Final</a>, where it finished as runners-up to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, losing 4–3 in extra time in an exciting finale at <a href="Basel">Basel</a>. It was the first of four occasions that the Catalan club won the tournament.
Fortuna acheived its success mostly with hometown players like the famous Allofs brothers (<a href="Klaus%20Allofs">Klaus Allofs</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Allofs">Thomas Allofs</a>) or players like <a href="Gerd%20Zewe">Gerd Zewe</a> (440 games in the Bundesliga), <a href="Dieter%20Herzog">Dieter Herzog</a>, <a href="Reiner%20Geye">Reiner Geye</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Seel">Wolfgang Seel</a> and <a href="Rudi%20Bommer">Rudi Bommer</a> who joined the team as nearly unknown players and ended as internationals. Between 1960 and 1967, <a href="Peter%20Meyer%20%28footballer%29">Peter Meyer</a> scored 119 goals in 174 games.
1980s to the new century.
Since its relegation in 1987, Fortuna has bounced back and forth between leagues, spending five more seasons in the Bundesliga in 1989–92 (after winning the 1988-89 2nd Bundesliga championship) and 1995–97 and slipping as low as <a href="Oberliga%20Nordrhein">Oberliga Nordrhein</a> (IV) in 2002–04. In 2001, the club escaped relegation to tier IV only because two other clubs were denied lisenses to play in tier III for finanicial reasons. Fortuna had its own money problems at the time but have since managed to arrange its finances more or less back into order. Between 2001 and 2003, the club was sponsored by German punk rock band <a href="Die%20Toten%20Hosen">Die Toten Hosen</a>.
Recent seasons.
In <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%203.%20Liga">2008–09</a>, Fortuna competed in the newly established <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>, finishing second and gaining automatic promotion to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, where it finished fourth in its comeback season, <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%202.%20Bundesliga">2009–10</a>. In this season, Fortuna was the only side unbeaten in home-matches in the three top German (nationwide) leagues.
After a promising 2009–10 season, the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%202.%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a> began poorly for Fortuna. After the first six games of the season, the club was in last place, having lost every match. During these first six matches, the club scored only two goals – one of which was an own-goal by the other side. Despite this discouraging start, Fortuna bounced back and finished the season in seventh place. <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%202.%20Bundesliga">2011–12</a> began very differently: after the first half of the season, Fortuna was in first place in the table with a remarkable record of 12 wins, 5 draws and 0 losses. The "Herbstmeister" title gave the team and the fans hope that this could be the year Fortuna returned to the Bundesliga. The second half of the season was more challenging, as Fortuna was unable to maintain its pace: it suffered four losses and a number of draws, slipping to third place in the final standings. Nonetheless, this was sufficient for them to qualify for the two-game relegation playoff against the third-last place team in the Bundesliga – Hertha BSC. The first game of the relegation was played on 10 May 2012 in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, with Fortuna winning 2–1. Fortuna drew the deciding game which was played on 15 May in Düsseldorf. Hertha fans, however, threw firecrackers at the field and the players, and one minute before the match ended, overexcited Fortuna fans stormed the field.
The promotion to the Bundesliga represented an extraordinary personal achievement for team captain <a href="Andreas%20Lambertz">Andreas Lambertz</a>, as he became the first player in German football history to be promoted three times with the same club, from the then fourth-tier Oberliga to the Bundesliga. For striker <a href="Sascha%20R%C3%B6sler">Sascha Rösler</a>, it marked the fourth time in his career that he was promoted from the Second Division into the Bundesliga.
Coming with the recent promotion, the club acheived a new record in German football history, becoming the only German club that has been relegated from the Bundesliga down to a fourth-tier league (time period of downfall: 1997–2002) and promoted back to the Bundesliga afterwards (time period of uprising: 2004–2012).
Fortuna started the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13 Bundesliga</a> season strongly: after five games, it was in fifth place in the table and concerns about relegation seemed to have been put to rest. However, Fortuna's 1–0 home win over <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">Greuther Fürth</a> on 16 February would prove to be the club's final victory of the season. The season concluded with Fortuna playing in <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a>, a match Fortuna lost 0–3. This defeat, combined with an <a href="FC%20Augsburg">Augsburg</a> win over Greuther Fürth and a bizarre and unlikely victory by <a href="TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim">Hoffenheim</a> over second-place Borussia Dortmund, resulted in Fortuna dropping two places. "Fortuna" finished 17th and were again reglegated to the 2. Bundesliga.
Fortuna's relegation was the result not only of this unlikely series of occurrences on the final day of the season, but also a poor conclusion to the year. Of its final eight matches, it did not win a single one; just one win would have secured its position for the following season's Bundesliga. This poor performance contributed to the dismissal of head coach <a href="Norbert%20Meier">Norbert Meier</a>.
Reglegation to the 2. Bundesliga led to a period of generally disappointing performance. Fortuna spent the years between 2013 and 2017 in the middle of the table, often battling against relegation and rarely challenging for promotion back to the Bundesliga. During these years, the club went through a series of coaching changes, with Oliver Reck, Frank Kramer, and former player Mike Buskens among others leading the club at various points. Success however remained elusive.
In March 2016, Friedhelm Funkel – a native of Neuss – took over as coach of Fortuna Düsseldorf. In his first game as coach, Funkel led the club to a 4–3 win against 1. FC Kaiserslautern, ending a month-long winless streak. Funkel's start as coach marked the beginning of a period of increased stability and success for Fortuna.
At the start of the 2017–18 season, two of Fortuna's strongest performers from the previous year, goalkeeper Michael Rensing and forward Ihlas Bebou, were both lost from the club with Rensing suffering two broken ribs and Bebou transferring to Bundesliga side Hannover 96. A further setback was that Funkel's assistant Peter Hermann asked to be released from his contaract with Fortuna in order to reojoin his mentor Jupp Heynckes upon his return to Bayern. With these three losses, it appeared that the 2017–18 season could be difficult for Fortuna. However, the club started extremely strongly: on the fourth day of the season, Fortuna had climbed to first place in the table, with a draw and three wins. For the remainder of the year, they would not drop below third place, benefitting from particularly strong play by Rensing's replacement in goal, Raphael Wolf, newly-acquired Belgian forward Benito Raman, striker Rouwen Hennings, and midfielder Florian Neuhaus. A late-season slump saw Fortuna lose three games in sucession in early April, but Fortuna won their next two matches, securing promotion to the Bundesliga. In the final game of the season, with promotion already secured, Fortuna defeated 1. FC Nürnberg 3–2 with a last-minute goal thereby securing first place and the 2. Bundesliga Championship, their second title after 1988–89. For coach Friedhelm Funkel, this marks the sixth time he had led a club to promotion—a German record.
Fortuna Düsseldorf's return to first-division football in 2018–19 was greeted with great enthusiasm by their supporters. The first half of the season was marked by strong but inconsistent play. Fortuna played remarkably well against top Bundesliga sides, taking a point from Leipzig and defeating Hoffenheim and first-place Borussia Dortmund. Most encouraging was an away draw against the defending champions Bayern Munich, when Fortuna came back after trailing 2–0 and 3–1, to secure a 3–3 draw in the 93rd minute, with <a href="Dodi%20Lukebakio">Dodi Lukebakio</a> scored all three of Fortuna's goals. However, Fortuna failed to play with the same consistency and decisiveness against clubs lower in the table, against whom they will battle to avoid relegation, losing to Augsburg, Nürnberg and Mainz, and only managing a draw against Stuttgart.<ref name="Termine18/19"></ref> Fortuna Düsseldorf entered the mid-winter break in 14th place in the table, concoluding the first half of the season with three sucessive wins against Freiburg, Dortmund and Hannover. Fortuna Düsseldorf enjoyed a more consistent second half of the season, with away wins over Augsburg, Hertha Berlin and one of their best performances in recent times, a storming display in a 0–4 win at Schalke 04. A 4–1 win at home to Werder Bremen and a 3–1 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach were highlights at home, whilst other home wins over VfB Stuttgart, Nürnberg and a final day defeat of Hannover 96 ensured a 10th place finish in the Bundesliga. This achieved Fortuna Düsseldorf's highest league finish since the 1989–90 Bundesliga season, where they finished 9th.

Rivalries and fan culture.
Fortuna's fiercest rivalry is with 1. FC Köln, which stems from the geographic proximity of Düsseldorf and Cologne as well as the historic rivalry between the two cities. However, in recent seasons, the clubs have rarely played in the same division, meaning that head-to-head encounters have become rarer. The 2013–14 season marked the last time the two clubs met in competitive matches when both played in the Second Division. For the 2018–19 season, Fortuna was promoted to the 1. Bundesliga precisely as 1. FC Köln was demoted from the Bundesliga to the Second Division, again avoiding the "Rheinland Derby".
Fortuna's other historic rivals are Rot-Weiss Essen, Bayer 04 Leverkusen, and Wuppertaler SV. During the 1970s, all four clubs played in the Bundesliga. Both Essen and Wuppertal have since dropped to lower leagues. Bayer Leverkusen, on the other hand, has emerged as a powerful force in the Bundesliga. Leverkusen's financial support from the Bayer chemical conglomerate has led to many Düsseldorf fans criticizing the club as "plastic" and inauthentic, without any real tradition. During the seasons when they both played in the Second Division, Fortuna's matches against MSV Duisburg and Borussia Mönchengladbach were hotly contested and were often referred to as "Lower Rhein Derbys". Fortuna Düsseldorf and Rot-Weiss Essen have played one another 59 times, and many fans still regard this as a heated rivalry, but direct matches have been rare in recent years. Fortuna also has inter-city rivalries with Düsseldorf SC99 and TuRU Düsseldorf, yet these have also lost their intensity. During the post-war years, no other club within the Düsseldorf city limits has ever played in a higher division than Fortuna.
Because of the dominance of FC Bayern München in recent decades, Fortuna also has a competitive rivalry with the Bavarians. Although Düsseldorf has not mounted a serious challenge for the Bundesliga championship since the early 1970s, matches between Fortuna and FC Bayern have been fiercely contested. In a 1975 match, Bayern led at halftime 4–2, but Fortuna came back to win 6–#5. On 9 December 1978, Fortuna defeated FC Bayern 7–1, an outcome which, to this day, remains FC Bayern's worst-ever away loss. During the 1985–86 season, Fortuna was the only team to win both of its games against the eventual champions from Munich, winning 4–0 and 3–2. 
The band <a href="Die%20Toten%20Hosen">Die Toten Hosen</a>, many of whose members are enthusiastic fans of Fortuna Düsseldorf, have celebrated the team's success against FC Bayern in their song "Bayern", which appears on their album "Immortal".
The last Bundesliga game was a draw after Munich had led 3–1. Fortuna scored two goals to make it 3–3 in the last 10 minutes.
The club has a particular strong affiliation with English Championship side <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>, with their supporters making annual visits to see them at their home ground, <a href="Portman%20Road">Portman Road</a>, since 2003. Ipswich fans have also done the same, with some coming to cheer Dusseldorf on at the Merkur Spiel-Arena.
Fortuna Düsseldorf enjoys a strong a spirited fan base, and supporters in the "ultra" curve of the stadium are well known for their elaborate choreographed displays and enthusiastic support for their club, which occasionally includes the lighting of "Bengalos" or fireworks in the stands.
Members of the band <a href="Die%20Toten%20Hosen">Die Toten Hosen</a>, including lead singer Campino, are often present at Fortuna matches at home and on the road, and when Fortuna celebrated its recent 2. Division championship in front of thousands of fans at Düsseldorf's city hall on 14 May 2018, the band appeared with them. The band is also highly regarded by the club for serving as sponsors during the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons, when the club had been relegated to the Regional League and faced financial difficulty.
Futsal.
Since 1 June 2015, Fortuna Düsseldorf has its futsal department. Since then, the <a href="Futsal">Futsal</a> department has developed into one of the strongest in Germany. They took part in the <a href="Deutsche%20Futsal-Meisterschaft">Deutsche Futsal Meisterschaft</a> 2021 of the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">DFB</a> as the winner of the Futsalliga West in the 2020–21 season and is one of the founding members of the <a href="Futsal%20Bundesliga">Futsal Bundesliga</a>.

SpVgg Unterhaching

Spielvereinigung Unterhaching () is a German <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> in <a href="Unterhaching">Unterhaching</a>, a semi-rural municipality on the southern outskirts of the Bavarian capital <a href="Munich">Munich</a>. The club is widely known for playing in the first-division <a href="association%20football">association football</a> league <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> alongside its more famous cousins, <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a>, for two seasons between 1999 and 2001, while the club's <a href="bobsleigh">bobsleigh</a> department has captured several world and Olympic titles. The football team won promotion into the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> (third tier) after beating Cottbus 4–1 on aggregate in June 2023.
History.
Early history.
Originally part of the gymnastics and sports club TSV Hachinger, SpVgg Unterhaching was established as an independent football club on 1 January 1925. Their first promotion to a higher division came in 1931 and they went on to be promoted to the A-Klasse a year later. However, the club was dissolved in 1933 as it was regarded as "politically unreliable" by the <a href="Nazism">Nazis</a> and was not re-established until after the end of World War II in 1945 to resume play in the amateur fourth division B-Klasse.
A rise through the ranks.
Unterhaching's football team was only an anonymous local amateur team with no significant successes until a climb through league ranks that began in 1976 with promotion from B-Klasse to A-Klasse play. A first-place finished earned the club quick promotion to the Bezirksliga in 1977. Continued good play put the team into the fourth-division <a href="Landesliga%20Bayern-S%C3%BCd">Landesliga Bayern-Süd</a> in 1979 and then the <a href="Oberliga%20Bayern">Oberliga Bayern</a> (III), the highest amateur division at the time, by 1981.
Unterhaching finished first there in 1983 to earn an appearance in the playoff round for the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, but failed to advance. They suffered a similar fate in 1988 when they next appeared in the promotion round.
The club finally emerged from the Oberliga to play in the 2. Bundesliga in 1989, but were quickly relegated after a 20th-place finish. Promoted a second time in 1992, they were once again sent down after a marginally better 18th-place result. Unterhaching next appeared in the second division in 1995 after a first-place finish in the new <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> (III).
Unterhaching in Bundesliga.
With their return to the 2. Bundesliga in the 1995–96 season the club would begin a period that would see them earn their best ever results. They finished 4th that season, then slipped to 6th and 11th-place results in their next two campaigns before securing promotion to the top-flight <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> after a 2nd-place finish in 1999 season.
They went on to surprise everyone with a respectable 10th-place result in their inaugural Bundesliga season and also famously played the spoiler's role in deciding who would win the championship that year. Their first Bundesliga win came in just their second match of the season, with a 2–0 victory over <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a> at home. While struggling in away matches, Unterhaching remained undefeated at home in nine games before losing 0–2 to their stronger neighbours, <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. Prior to this loss, they had earned wins at home in matches against highly favoured teams like <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> and <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, beating them 2–0 and 1–0 respectively. They earned their first away win in the Bundesliga by beating VfB Stuttgart 2–0 once again.
On the final matchday of the season, visiting <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> needed only a draw in Unterhaching to secure their first national title, but instead went down to defeat to the determined home side. Things took a sinister turn for Leverkusen when <a href="Michael%20Ballack">Michael Ballack</a> scored an <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> that put home side ahead in the 20th minute. Their title hopes ended when Haching midfielder <a href="Markus%20Oberleitner">Markus Oberleitner</a> made the score 2–0 in the 72nd minute. Meanwhile, Bayern Munich beat <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> 3–1 at home and were able to overtake Leverkusen on goal difference to snatch away the title. With a 10th-place result, Unterhaching finished ahead of long-established sides Borussia Dortmund and <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>. They ended the season with the league's fifth best home record with 10 wins and 5 draws in 17 matches having lost only to Bayern Munich and <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a>.
Goalkeeper <a href="Gerhard%20Tremmel">Gerhard Tremmel</a>, defenders <a href="Alexander%20Strehmel">Alexander Strehmel</a> and <a href="Jochen%20Seitz">Jochen Seitz</a>, midfielders <a href="Markus%20Oberleitner">Markus Oberleitner</a> and <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breitenreiter">André Breitenreiter</a> and striker <a href="Altin%20Rraklli">Altin Rraklli</a> were among the most memorable players of a team that impressed by its discipline. Breitenreiter and Rraklli scored 13 Bundesliga goals between them that season.
However, the start of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Bundesliga">2000–01 season</a> was a nightmare for Unterhaching as they would win only one and draw two of their first eight matches. While the team went undefeated in its next six matches, they were unable to maintain that form and at the mid-season break were only out of the relegation zone on goal difference. The second half of the season was just as dismal, and although they earned wins over local rivals <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a>, their campaign would end with a 16th-place result and relegation.
As the season drew to a close Unterhaching was once again in a position to help Bayern Munich win another title. Needing only to hold second-place <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> to a draw in their final match to ensure Bayern's win, Unterhaching held 2–0 and 3–2 advantages before finally succumbing 3–5 to Schalke. Bayern then had to make their own way to the championship with at least a draw against <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> which they only narrowly managed on a <a href="Patrik%20Andersson">Patrik Andersson</a> equalizer (1–1) deep into stoppage time.
Ironically, in the middle of their poor season, SpVgg Unterhaching would emerge as winners of the last <a href="DFB-Hallenpokal">DFB-Hallenpokal</a>, an indoor football tournament staged during the winter break of the Bundesliga season from 1987 to 2001.
Recent history.
The club's struggles continued after their relegation to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. Needing an away win in their final match of the season in order to avoid being sent down to the Regionalliga Süd (III), they instead went down to a 0–3 defeat to <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a> and finished in 15th place. They re-bounded the following season, taking the Regionalliga title, and making their way back to second division competition. Subsequently, Haching has delivered poor results in the 2. Bundesliga, narrowly avoiding being relegated again in both 2004 and 2006 before finally dropping into the Regionalliga in 2007, finishing 16th in the table due to <a href="FC%20Carl%20Zeiss%20Jena">FC Carl Zeiss Jena</a>'s 2–1 win against <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a>.
In the 2007–08 season, the club was never really in contention for a 2. Bundesliga return but did qualify for the new <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>. In its first season in the new, nationwide 3. Liga, the club was close to promotion, but a loss 3–4-loss against Carl Zeiss Jena on the 37th matchday earned them a fall from second to fourth place, and a prolonged stay in the third league.
In 2009–10 the club started well, but went down the table during winter. 2008–09's successful coach <a href="Ralph%20Hasenh%C3%BCttl">Ralph Hasenhüttl</a> got replaced by the 1990-world champion <a href="Klaus%20Augenthaler">Klaus Augenthaler</a>, who led the team to a finish on a secure 11th place.
The club finished one place above the relegation zone in the 3. Liga in 2013–14, coming 17th but was relegated to the tier four <a href="Regionalliga%20Bayern">Regionalliga Bayern</a> at the end of the 2014–15 season. It qualified for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20DFB-Pokal">2015–16 DFB-Pokal</a> where it knocked-out <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">FC Ingolstadt 04</a> and <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> before losing to <a href="Bayer%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> in the third round.
In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Regionalliga">2022–23 season</a>, Unterhaching returned to the 3. Liga as champions of the <a href="Regionalliga%20Bayern">Regionalliga Bayern</a>.

Reserve team.
SpVgg Unterhaching II (or "SpVgg Unterhaching Amateure") belong to the Bayernliga since 2001, coming ninth in the 2007–08 season of this league. Due to a number of clubs in the league not receiving a licence for the Regionalliga, the team gained entry to the Regionalliga Süd for the 2008–09 season. The team returned to the Bayernliga again after being relegated in 2009.
In March 2015, the club announced that it would withdraw its reserve team at the end of the 2014–15 season after a rule change that allowed 3. Liga Clubs to do so. SpVgg Unterhaching stated financial reasons for this step.
Stadium.
SpVgg Unterhaching's home stadium is the municipal Stadion am Sportpark (capacity 15,053), now known as Alpenbauer Sportpark under a sponsorship arrangement with the club. The club's fan base is local in character, although it has developed a small following as one of Germany's "Kult" teams.
Until 1960, Haching played their home matches at the Jahnstraße football field and moved then to the Grünauer Allee stadium, which has about 4,000 standing places and where they played before the Sportpark stadium opened in April 1992. The Grünauer Allee stadium is now home ground of the club's reserve squad, Haching II, which is currently playing in the fourth-division Oberliga Bayern.
The Grünauer Allee stadium is also the home ground of Fortuna Unterhaching, established in 1992 and playing close to the bottom end of the German league system. During winter, Fortuna Unterhaching shares the artificial football pitch owned by SpVgg Unterhaching.
Bobsleigh.
In 1975, local entrepreneur and club sponsor Anton Schrobenhauser († 1982) founded the bobsleigh department, which he presided over until 1979. The club's bobsledders have since achieved a number of excellent results on the national and international level.
Numerous Olympic medals and world championship titles make <a href="Christoph%20Langen">Christoph Langen</a> Unterhaching's outstanding bobsledder. His honours include:

Eintracht Braunschweig

Braunschweiger Turn- und Sportverein Eintracht von 1895 e.V., commonly known as Eintracht Braunschweig () or BTSV (), is a German <a href="association%20football">football</a> and <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> based in <a href="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a>, <a href="Lower%20Saxony">Lower Saxony</a>. The club was one of the founding members of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 1963 and won the national title in <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Bundesliga">1967</a>. The club plays in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, the second tier of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>.
Since 1923, Eintracht Braunschweig has played at the <a href="Eintracht-Stadion">Eintracht-Stadion</a>. The club shares a <a href="Lower%20Saxony%20derby">rivalry</a> with fellow Lower Saxon side <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a>.
In addition to the football division, Eintracht has departments for several other sports, of which historically the <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a> department has been the most successful.
History.
Foundation and early years.
Eintracht Braunschweig was founded as the football and <a href="cricket">cricket</a> club FuCC Eintracht 1895 in 1895, became FC Eintracht von 1895 in 1906, then SV Eintracht in 1920.
The team has a colourful history and it quickly became one of northern Germany's favourite sides. In 1900, Eintracht Braunschweig was among the <a href="Founding%20Clubs%20of%20the%20DFB">founding members</a> of the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB). It enjoyed success early on, playing in the upper tier league, winning the <a href="Northern%20German%20football%20championship">Northern German championship</a> in 1908 and 1913, and placing three players on the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany national team</a> by 1914. Under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>, the team played in the <a href="Gauliga%20Niedersachsen">Gauliga Niedersachsen</a> and managed two appearances in the <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">national final rounds</a>. In <a href="1943%20German%20football%20championship">1942–43</a>, Eintracht Braunschweig went into the national championship play-offs as one of the main favourites. The team under manager <a href="Georg%20Kn%C3%B6pfle">Georg "Schorsch" Knöpfle</a> had just won the newly formed <a href="Gauliga%20S%C3%BCdhannover-Braunschweig">Gauliga Südhannover-Braunschweig</a> with a record of 17 wins and 1 draw in 18 games, scoring 146 goals in the process. After a convincing 5–1 win over <a href="SC%20Victoria%20Hamburg">Victoria Hamburg</a> in the first round, the draw saw the club paired with the other big favourites for the title, <a href="Helmut%20Sch%C3%B6n">Helmut Schön</a>'s <a href="Dresdner%20SC">Dresdner SC</a>. Dresden won the game held in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> with 4–0, and subsequently won the German championship, with an undefeated season.
Post-war football.
As part of the <a href="denazification">denazification</a> of Germany after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="Allied-occupied%20Germany">British authorities</a> dissolved all previously existing sports clubs in Braunschweig and demanded the creation of a single, united sports club for the city. As such, Eintracht Braunschweig was merged into the new club TSV Braunschweig on 2 November 1945. TSV Braunschweig finally took on the club's current name, Braunschweiger TSV Eintracht von 1895, on 1 April 1949.
The club continued to play in the top division – now the <a href="Oberliga%20Nord%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Nord</a> – after the war, with the exception of a single season (1952–53) spent in tier II. The side was touched by tragedy in 1949 when goalkeeper Gustav Fähland died of internal bleeding a few days after being injured during a game in a collision with a <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> striker. Another appearance in the final round of the national championship came in <a href="1958%20German%20football%20championship">1958</a>.
Bundesliga football 1963 to 1985.
Eintracht Braunschweig's consistently high standard of play and financial stability helped it to become one of the <a href="Introduction%20of%20the%20Bundesliga">16 teams selected out of a group of 46 applicants</a> for play in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, the new federal professional league formed in 1963. Once again the side enjoyed early success, winning the national title in the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Bundesliga">1966–67 season</a> under manager <a href="Helmuth%20Johannsen">Helmuth Johannsen</a> with solid defensive play. That championship team gave up only 27 goals against, which stood as a Bundesliga record until bettered by Werder Bremen in 1988. Another ten players joined the national side from the team, mostly through the 1960s and 1970s.
The club was hit by tragedy again during the winter break of the <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Bundesliga">1968–69 season</a> when forward <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Moll">Jürgen Moll</a>, aged 29 at the time, and his wife died in a car accident. Two charity matches were played for the benefit of the Molls' children, the first featured West Germany's <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954 FIFA World Cup</a>-winning squad in the line-up of the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">tournament's final</a>, and the second saw a combined squad of Eintracht Braunschweig and rivals <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a> take on a Bundesliga all-star team.
The club found itself embroiled in the <a href="Bundesliga%20scandal%20%281971%29">Bundesliga scandal of 1971</a>, but with a somewhat unusual twist. A number of players accepted payments totalling 40,000 <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">DM</a> – not to underperform and so lose or tie a game, but rather to put out an extra effort to win. Ultimately, two players were suspended and another ten were fined.
In 1973, in the face of some opposition from the league, Braunschweig became the first Bundesliga side to sport a sponsor logo on its jerseys – that of <a href="Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Wolfenbüttel</a>-based liquor producer <a href="J%C3%A4germeister">Jägermeister</a>. The move paid the team 100,000 DM and introduced a new way of doing business to football that is worth millions today. Other clubs quickly followed suit. Braunschweig's game against <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> on 24 March 1973 became the first Bundesliga match to feature a club having sponsorship on its jersey. Jägermeister continued to sponsor the club until 1987, although a later attempt to rename the team "Jägermeister Braunschweig" was finally refused by the DFB in 1983.
Eintracht Braunschweig just missed a second title in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Bundesliga">1977</a> when it finished third, one point back of champion <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> and just behind second-place finisher Schalke 04 on goal difference. The club made news after the season by signing 1974 World Cup winner <a href="Paul%20Breitner">Paul Breitner</a> from <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> for a transfer fee of 1.6 million DM. Breitner, however, did not fit into the team at all and was sold to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> after just one season.
The side counted a casualty in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> in the death of <a href="Lutz%20Eigendorf">Lutz Eigendorf</a>, who fled <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> in 1979, where he played for <a href="Berliner%20FC%20Dynamo">Dynamo Berlin</a>, to come to the west to play for <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a>. Shortly after his transfer to Braunschweig in 1983, he died in a motor vehicle accident which was revealed in 2000 as the assassination of a "traitor" arranged by the <a href="Stasi">Stasi</a>, East Germany's secret police.
The club played in the Bundesliga through to the mid-1980s having been relegated just twice, playing in the second division in 1973–74 and again in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%202.%20Bundesliga">1980–81</a>. During the club's run of 322 games in the Bundesliga from 1963 to 1973, it set a record that still stands by not seeing a single player <a href="Fouls%20and%20misconduct%20%28association%20football%29">red-carded</a>. In <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Bundesliga">1984–85</a>, Eintracht Braunschweig was relegated from the Bundesliga for the third time.
Decline.
Since the 1985–86 season, the side has played at the tier II and III levels, with the exception of the 2013–14 season. In 1987, Braunschweig set a mark even as they were demoted; it became the only team ever to have been relegated with a positive goal differential, with 52 goals for and 47 against. After having been stuck in the <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a> for most of the 1990s, Eintracht Braunschweig moved constantly between the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> and the Regionalliga during the 2000s. At the end of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Regionalliga">2007–08 Regionalliga season</a>, the club was facing a severe crisis, both financially and on the field: Eintracht was in serious danger of missing out on qualification for Germany's new nationwide third-tier league <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>, which would have meant Braunschweig's first ever relegation to the fourth level of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>.
Recent history.
With new manager <a href="Torsten%20Lieberknecht">Torsten Lieberknecht</a>, however, who had only taken over the job a few weeks before, Eintracht Braunschweig qualified for the 3. Liga on the last matchday of the season. Moreover, under Lieberknecht and also newly appointed <a href="director%20of%20football">director of football</a> <a href="Marc%20Arnold">Marc Arnold</a>, the club continued to steadily improve throughout the next few seasons; a resurgence on and off the field that was widely recognized by the German media. In <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%203.%20Liga">2010–11</a>, the team won promotion back to the 2. Bundesliga as champions of the 3. Liga. There, Eintracht Braunschweig re-established itself quickly, finishing the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%202.%20Bundesliga">2011–12 season</a> comfortably mid-table. The <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%202.%20Bundesliga">2012–13 season</a> should prove even more successful: on the second matchday, Braunschweig took over a direct promotion spot and kept it for the rest of the season. On the 31st matchday, the club secured its return to the Bundesliga after 28 years in the second and third divisions with a 1–0 away win over <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">FC Ingolstadt 04</a>.
The team finished the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bundesliga">2013–14 Bundesliga</a> season in 18th place and was therefore relegated again after one season in the top-flight. Eintracht Braunschweig had spent most of the season on a relegation spot, but had a chance to stay in the league until the last matchday. However, the club was officially relegated on 10 May 2014 after a 3–1 loss at <a href="TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim">1899 Hoffenheim</a>. Eintracht came close to a return to the Bundesliga in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%202.%20Bundesliga">2016–17</a>: the club finished third in the 2. Bundesliga and qualified for the promotion play-off to the Bundesliga, but lost 2–0 on aggregate to <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> to remain in the 2. Bundesliga.
On 13 May 2018, Eintracht Braunschweig were relegated to the 3. Liga after a 6–2 loss to <a href="Holstein%20Kiel">Holstein Kiel</a>.
In <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20in%20German%20football">2018–19</a>, poor performances on the pitch meant that Braunschweig almost got relegated to the fourth tier, <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a>, surviving relegation on goal difference. In the following season, the club finished third to be promoted back to the 2. Bundesliga, before being relegated in 2020–21, followed by another promotion after a second-placed finish.
Crest and colours.
Colours.
Traditionally, Eintracht Braunschweig plays its home games in the colours blue and yellow. Those colours are derived from the flag of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brunswick">Duchy of Brunswick</a>.
Crest.
The club's crest contains a red lion on white ground. This symbol is derived from the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the city of <a href="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a>, which in turn is based on the <a href="Brunswick%20Lion">insignia</a> of <a href="Henry%20the%20Lion">Henry the Lion</a>. The club badge went through various different versions during its history, most of the time however it consisted of a circular badge in blue and yellow, with a red lion on a white shield in the center of the circle.
In 1972–73, Eintracht Braunschweig scrapped the original crest and replaced it with a new design based on the logo of its sponsor, <a href="J%C3%A4germeister">Jägermeister</a>. This was initially done to circumvent the DFB's ban on shirt sponsors – a loophole in those rules allowed to club to put a very close looking symbol on their shirt as long as it was the club's official crest. In 1986, after Jägermeister stopped the sponsorship of the club, Eintracht Braunschweig adopted a new, diamond-shaped logo containing the traditional red lion as well as the club's colours blue and yellow.
In 2011, the club members voted to return to the club's more traditional round crest. In March 2012, the club then presented the new version of the crest, which was adopted as the official logo at the start of the 2012–13 season. For the 2016–17 season, the club wore a special anniversary crest to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the club's 1966–67 Bundesliga title.
Stadium.
Eintracht Braunschweig plays at the <a href="Eintracht-Stadion">Eintracht-Stadion</a> in Braunschweig, built in 1923.

Because of <a href="Wolfsburg">Wolfsburg</a>'s immediate proximity to Braunschweig, journalists often report a rivalry with <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a>. Also matches between the two are often referred to as a derby. This is denied by the fans of Eintracht Braunschweig as well as the Fans of Hannover 96, who only consider their matches against each other as the only true <a href="Lower%20Saxony%20derby">Lower Saxony derby</a>.
League history.
Between 1904 and 1985, Eintracht Braunschweig spent all but three seasons in <a href="History%20of%20the%20German%20football%20league%20system">Germany's top division</a>. Between 1985 and 2013, the club then alternated between the second and third level of the German league pyramid, before returning to the top flight for the first time in 28 years at the end of the 2012–13 season.

Liga</a> (III), then finished the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%203.%20Liga">2013–14 3. Liga</a> season as runners-up and was promoted to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> (II) as the first team since the introduction of the 3. Liga to win promotion after only one season. On 12 May 2016, RB Leipzig along with <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a> ensured promotion to the Bundesliga for the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Bundesliga">2016–17 season</a> with a 2–0 win over <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a>.
RB Leipzig earned a place in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the first time by finishing as runners-up in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Bundesliga">2016–17 Bundesliga</a>. They reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2019–20 UEFA Champions League</a>, losing to <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">Paris Saint-Germain</a> of France. On 21 May 2022, they won their first major title, the <a href="2022%20DFB-Pokal%20final">DFB-Pokal</a>, against <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a>. They would win a <a href="2023%20DFB-Pokal%20final">second consecutive title</a> the following season, this time defeating <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>.
RB Leipzig's entrance into the upper echelons of German football has proven controversial, as the club's heavy corporate influence is regarded by many Germans to be antithetical to the traditional ownership, structure and management of sports clubs in Germany. On the other hand, some have expressed appreciation for what they view as an honourable endeavour to establish a durable footprint for the Bundesliga in the former <a href="German%20Democratic%20Republic">German Democratic Republic</a>, which previously had been at best tenuous since <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>.
History.
2006–2009: negotiations with various clubs and founding.
Before investing in Leipzig, <a href="Red%20Bull%20GmbH">Red Bull GmbH</a>, led by co-owner <a href="Dietrich%20Mateschitz">Dietrich Mateschitz</a>, spent three and a half years looking for a suitable location to invest in German football. Besides Leipzig, the company also considered a location in <a href="Western%20Germany">Western Germany</a>, exploring such cities as <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="Munich">Munich</a> and <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>.
The company made its first attempt to enter the German football scene in 2006. On the advice of <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, a personal friend of Dietrich Mateschitz, the company decided to invest in Leipzig. The local football club <a href="FC%20Sachsen%20Leipzig">FC Sachsen Leipzig</a>, successor to the former <a href="List%20of%20East%20German%20football%20champions">East German champions</a> <a href="BSG%20Chemie%20Leipzig%20%281950%29">BSG Chemie Leipzig</a>, had for years been in financial difficulties. Red Bull GmbH drew up plans to invest up to 50 million euros in the club. The company planned a takeover, with a change of the team's colours and club name. Involved in the arrangements was film entrepreneur Michael Kölmel, sponsor of FC Sachsen Leipzig and owner of the Zentralstadion. By 2006, FC Sachsen Leipzig played in the Oberliga, by then the fourth tier in the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>. Playing in the fourth tier, the club had to undergo the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association (DFB)</a> licensing procedure. Red Bull GmbH and the club were close to a deal, but the plans were vetoed by the DFB, which rejected the proposed new club name "FC Red Bull Sachsen Leipzig" fearing too much influence from the company. After months of fan protests against Red Bull's involvement, which deteriorated into violence, the company officially abandoned the plans.
Red Bull GmbH then turned to the former West Germany. The company made contact with <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>-based cult club <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a>, known for its <a href="Left-wing%20politics">left</a>-leaning supporters, and met representatives of the club to discuss a sponsorship deal. A short time before, supporters of FC St. Pauli had participated in protests against Red Bull's takeover of <a href="SV%20Austria%20Salzburg">SV Austria Salzburg</a>. Once it became clear to the Hamburg side that the company had plans that went far beyond conventional sponsoring, it immediately ended the contact, and the question was never considered by the club's management. Red Bull then made contact with <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">TSV 1860 Munich</a>. Negotiations began behind closed doors, but the club was not interested in an investment and ended the discussions.
In 2007, Red Bull GmbH made plans to invest in <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>, a traditional club with more than 100 years of history. The plans became public, and it was revealed that the company wanted to acquire more than 50 percent of the shares. Rumours spread that the company wanted to rename the club "Red Bull Düsseldorf", or similar. This was immediately met with wild protests from club supporters. As with FC Sachsen Leipzig, Red Bull's offer also ran into legal difficulties: the statutes of the DFB did not allow changing a club name for advertising purposes, nor for an external investor to obtain a majority share.
Eventually, the plans were soundly rejected by club members. The company began to reconsider the former East Germany.
Leipzig was considered an ideal place for an investment. The potential for establishing a new club in Leipzig seemed huge. The city had a rich history in football, being the meeting place for the founding of the DFB and the home of the first German national football champions, <a href="VfB%20Leipzig">VfB Leipzig</a>. During East Germany's existence, local teams such as <a href="1.%20FC%20Lokomotive%20Leipzig">1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig</a> and its rival, <a href="BSG%20Chemie%20Leipzig%20%281950%29">BSG Chemie Leipzig</a>, played at the highest level of the <a href="East%20German%20football%20league%20system">East German football league system</a>, and even on the international level. The current state of football there was, however, poor. No team from the city had played in the Bundesliga since 1994, and no team had played in a professional league since 1998. Its two best teams would soon play in the Oberliga, and local football was plagued by fan violence. The city hungered for top-level football. Leipzig had a population of around 500,000 inhabitants. The city thus had considerable economic strength and fan potential. At the same time, there were no Bundesliga clubs located anywhere near the city, which further strengthened the possibility of attracting sponsors and fans.
Leipzig was fortunate to have a well-developed infrastructure, in the form of <a href="Leipzig/Halle%20Airport">an international airport</a>, motorway connections and, most importantly, <a href="Red%20Bull%20Arena%20%28Leipzig%29">a large, modern football stadium</a>. The Zentralstadion was a former <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> venue and the second-largest football stadium in the east of Germany, after the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a> in Berlin.
An investment in a club playing in one of the top divisions in Germany would have been a costly affair for Red Bull. From previous experience, the company knew that the existing traditions of such a club would hinder success in the league. It also knew that an investment in a club playing in one of the top divisions would meet legal difficulties, making such an investment risky. Instead, the company found that a newly established club, designed for the company, would be the better option for an investment. Early in 2009, Red Bull GmbH contacted the <a href="Saxony%20Football%20Association">Saxony Football Association (SFV)</a>, about the procedure to establish a new club in Saxony.
A newly established club would need teams and a playing license. If it did not acquire a license from another club, it would have to start playing in the lowest tier league, the <a href="Kreisliga">Kreisklasse</a>. The company searched for a club playing in the <a href="Oberliga%20%28football%29">Oberliga</a>, since 2008 the fifth tier in the German football league system, and therefore not subject to the DFB licensing system. On the advice of media entrepreneur Michael Kölmel, the company was led to <a href="SSV%20Markranst%C3%A4dt">SSV Markranstädt</a>, a small club from a town 13 kilometers west of Leipzig. The club was positively inclined to entering a partnership with a global company. Its president, Holger Nussbaum, wanted to secure the club's long-term finances, and designed a plan to engage Red Bull GmbH. Holger Nussbaum presented his plan to Kölmel, who saw his chance and decided to join in the deal. Assisted by Kölmel, Red Bull GmbH began negotiations with SSV Markranstädt. Five weeks after the negotiations began, SSV Markranstädt had agreed to sell its licence for the Oberliga to Red Bull GmbH. The cost was not disclosed, but SSV Markranstädt is believed to have received a compensation of 350,000 euro.
"RasenBallsport Leipzig e.V." was founded on 19 May 2009. All seven founding members were either employees or agents of Red Bull GmbH. Andreas Sadlo was elected chairman, and <a href="Joachim%20Krug">Joachim Krug</a> was hired as sporting director. Andreas Sadlo, another founding member, was a well-known football player agent, working for the agency "Stars & Friends". In order to avoid future objections from the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB), Sadlo resigned as player agent, before taking the position of chairman. The statutes of the DFB would not allow a player agent to be involved in the operating affairs of a club. Krug had earlier been employed as coach and manager by <a href="Rot%20Weiss%20Ahlen">Rot Weiss Ahlen</a>, at that time known as "LR Ahlen" and sponsored by cosmetics manufacturer LR International.
RB Leipzig became the fifth football commitment in the Red Bull sporting portfolio, following <a href="FC%20Red%20Bull%20Salzburg">FC Red Bull Salzburg</a> in Austria, the <a href="New%20York%20Red%20Bulls">New York Red Bulls</a> in the United States, <a href="Red%20Bull%20Brasil">Red Bull Brasil</a> in Brazil and <a href="Red%20Bull%20Ghana">Red Bull Ghana</a> in Ghana. In contrast with previous clubs, RB Leipzig did not bear the corporate name. The statutes of the DFB would not permit a corporate name to be included in the club name. Instead, the club adopted the unusual name "RasenBallsport", literally meaning "Lawn Ball Sports". By using the initials "RB", as in "Red Bull", the corporate identity could still be recognized.
RB Leipzig began as a partnership with fifth-division side SSV Markranstädt. The partnership meant that SSV Markranstädt would provide the initial core of RB Leipzig, as the starting point for RB's leap into German football. RB Leipzig acquired a playing license for the Oberliga, the top three men's teams and a senior men's team from SSV Markranstädt. The first team was completely taken over, with its training staff and its head coach, Tino Vogel, the son of former East German football legend <a href="Eberhard%20Vogel">Eberhard Vogel</a>.
The transfer of the licence for the Oberliga had to be approved by the <a href="North%20East%20German%20Football%20Association">North East German Football Association</a> (NOFV). RB Leipzig would need at least four junior teams, including an A-junior team, to obtain the licence. In the deal, SSV Markranstädt had kept its junior department, and RB Leipzig lacked junior teams. Red Bull GmbH therefore approached FC Sachsen Leipzig. The club was again in financial difficulties, and could no longer finance its youth department. The NOFV approved the transfer of the playing right on 13 June 2009, and RB Leipzig was given one year to complete its stable of junior teams. The club then acquired four junior teams from FC Sachsen Leipzig. The <a href="Saxony%20Football%20Association">Saxony Football Association (SFV)</a> urged the acquisition, in order to prevent a talent exodus.
RB Leipzig would play its inaugural season in the Oberliga at the <a href="Stadion%20am%20Bad">Stadion am Bad</a> in Markranstädt. The stadium held 5,000 seats and was the traditional home ground of SSV Markranstädt. The plans were for RB to soon move to the far larger Zentralstadion, hopefully in 2010, after advancing to the Regionalliga. The stadium was owned by Michael Kölmel who had been known to Red Bull GmbH for years and had, as a negotiation partner, facilitated the establishment of RB Leipzig. Michael Kölmel had himself been involved in local football previously, as a sponsor of FC Sachsen Leipzig. He was eager to find a strong tenant for the stadium, which last saw FC Sachsen Leipzig play in the Regionalliga behind closed doors. Negotiations between Red Bull GmbH and Michael Kölmel began immediately upon the club's founding. Red Bull GmbH reserved the naming right to the stadium in June 2009, meaning that the name could not be sold to another company.
On its founding, RB Leipzig aimed to play first-division Bundesliga football within eight years. Following the model previously followed by Red Bull GmbH in Austria and the US, the club was set to emerge and quickly rise through the divisions. It was predicted that Red Bull GmbH would invest 100 million euro in the club over a period of ten years, and Mateschitz openly spoke of the possibility of ultimately winning the German championship. The last team from Leipzig to do so was <a href="VfB%20Leipzig">VfB Leipzig</a> in 1913.
2009–2016: rise through the divisions.
After some previously scheduled games had to be canceled due to safety concerns, RB Leipzig played its first match on 10 July 2009, a friendly match against the <a href="Landesliga">Landesliga</a> club SV Bannewitz. The match was played at the "Stadion am Bad" in <a href="Markranst%C3%A4dt">Markranstädt</a> and ended with a 5–0 win for RB Leipzig. The club played its first competitive match on 31 July 2009, in the first round of the <a href="Saxony%20Cup">Saxony Cup</a> against VfK Blau–Weiß Leipzig. After switching sides, RB Leipzig played as the home team and won the match 5–0. The club then played its first league match in an away match against <a href="FC%20Carl%20Zeiss%20Jena">FC Carl Zeiss Jena II</a> on 8 August 2009. The match ended 1–1.
During the further course of the season, RB Leipzig suffered its first defeat on 13 September 2009, in a match against <a href="Budissa%20Bautzen">Budissa Bautzen</a>. Despite minor setbacks, the club was crowned as "<a href="Herbstmeister">Herbstmeister</a>", standing at first place after the first half of the 2009–10 season. The team returned for the second half of the season even stronger, having signed the experienced midfielder and 2. Bundesliga player <a href="Timo%20Rost">Timo Rost</a> from <a href="FC%20Energie%20Cottbus">Energie Cottbus</a> in January 2010. The team secured first place in the 2009–10 NOFV–Oberliga Süd at the 25th matchday, thus earning promotion to the 2010–11 <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a>. The team finished the season with an impressive goal difference of 74–17, having suffered only two defeats. The playing right for the Regionalliga was issued by the DFB on 4 May 2010. RB Leipzig targeted a place in the 2010–11 DFB–Pokal, which would have been won by winning the 2009–10 Saxony Cup. The team reached the quarterfinals in the Saxony Cup, but was eliminated after a defeat against <a href="FSV%20Zwickau">FSV Zwickau</a> on 13 November 2009.
The incumbent chairman, Andreas Saldo, left the club in January 2010 and the position was assumed by the former <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> sporting director and incumbent sporting director for the common Red Bull football commitment <a href="Dietmar%20Beiersdorfer">Dietmar Beiersdorfer</a>. One day after the last match of the 2009–10 season, Beiersdorfer released head coach Tino Vogel, assistant coach Lars Weißenberger and sporting director Joachim Krug from their positions. This action was done after Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz had announced a change in strategy. According to the new strategy, RB Leipzig was going to represent the key project in the football commitment of the company, in place of FC Red Bull Salzburg. Tomas Oral was announced as the new head coach on 18 June 2010.
The players Christian Mittenzwei, <a href="Sebastian%20Hauck">Sebastian Hauck</a>, Stefan Schumann, Toni Jurascheck and <a href="Michael%20Lerchl">Michael Lerchl</a> did not receive new contracts for the following Regionalliga season, while players Frank Räbsch, Ronny Kujat and two other players ended their careers.
Before entry to the Regionalliga, there were two significant changes in the club. The club returned the second, third and fourth team to SSV Markranstädt. In order to replace the reserve team, the club adopted the first team of ESV Delitzsch as its reserve team and purchased its playing right for the <a href="Bezirksliga">Bezirksliga Leipzig</a>. The first team moved from the Stadion am Bad in <a href="Markranst%C3%A4dt">Markranstädt</a>, to make the Zentralstadion in Leipzig its new home arena. The former 2006 FIFA World Cup venue was simultaneously renamed Red Bull Arena. The opening of the Red Bull Arena was celebrated on 24 July 2010 with a friendly match against the German vice-champions <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">FC Schalke 04</a> in front of 21,566 spectators. The match ended with a 1–2 loss for RB Leipzig. The first team played its last game at the Stadion am Bad six days later on 30 July 2010, a friendly match against <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>, which ended with a 2–1 win for RB Leipzig.
The 2010–11 Regionalliga season started with a series of draws, the first one on 6 August 2010 against <a href="T%C3%BCrkiyemspor%20Berlin">Türkiyemspor Berlin</a> in front of 4,028 spectators at the Red Bull Arena. The first win came at the 4th matchday, in an away match against <a href="Holstein%20Kiel">Holstein Kiel</a>, which ended 1–2 for RB Leipzig. The first home win came immediately after, at the 5th matchday, in a match against <a href="1.%20FC%20Magdeburg">1. FC Magdeburg</a>, which ended 2–1 for RB Leipzig. After a moderate start to the season, the club found itself chasing <a href="Chemnitzer%20FC">Chemnitzer FC</a>, which was considered a possible candidate for promotion. At the end of the year, RB Leipzig confirmed its ambitions to gain promotion, by signing Brazilian midfielder <a href="Thiago%20Rockenbach">Thiago Rockenbach</a>. The club had signed forward <a href="Carsten%20Kammlott">Carsten Kammlott</a>, considered a promising young talent, and the experienced Leipzig-born defender <a href="Tim%20Sebastian%20%28footballer%29">Tim Sebastian</a>, during the summer.
The club finished its first season in the Regionalliga in 4th place, thus missing out on promotion. However, under coach Tomas Oral, the club succeeded in winning the 2010–11 Saxony Cup after defeating <a href="Chemnitzer%20FC">Chemnitzer FC</a> 1–0 in the final on 1 June 2011 in front of 13,958 spectators at the Red Bull Arena. By winning the 2010–11 Saxony Cup, the club won its first title in club history. It also qualified to participate in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20DFB-Pokal">2011–12 DFB-Pokal</a>. Because the club missed out on promotion during the second half of the 2010–11 season, <a href="Peter%20Pacult">Peter Pacult</a> from <a href="Rapid%20Wien">Rapid Wien</a> was announced as the new head coach for the 2011–12 season on 4 May 2011. Almost simultaneously, the club announced that sporting director <a href="Thomas%20Linke">Thomas Linke</a> had been released from his position, having been employed for only 10 weeks, from February 2011. Various media suspected a connection between the signing of Pacult and the departure of Linke.
Also, several players left the team, among them <a href="Lars%20M%C3%BCller">Lars Müller</a>, <a href="Sven%20Neuhaus">Sven Neuhaus</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Kl%C3%A4sener">Thomas Kläsener</a> and <a href="Nico%20Frommer">Nico Frommer</a>, all participants in the previous Saxony Cup final. With Daniel Rosin, Timo Rost and Benjamin Bellot, only three players from the former Oberliga team remained in the team for the 2011–12 Regionalliga season, while the former international <a href="Ingo%20Hertzsch">Ingo Hertzsch</a> as a fourth of these players remained in the club. Hertzsch ended his professional career after the 2010–11 season, but went on to join the reserve team, RB Leipzig II, and the RB Leipzig business operation. On 29 July 2011, RB Leipzig made its debut in the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, in front of 31,212 spectators at the Red Bull Arena. The team knocked Bundesliga club <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> out of the first round of the cup, beating them 3–2 after a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> by <a href="Daniel%20Frahn">Daniel Frahn</a>. The team was eliminated in the next round, defeated 0–1 by <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a>. The 2011–12 Regionalliga season saw the largest win in club history, when RB Leipzig defeated <a href="SV%20Wilhelmshaven">SV Wilhelmshaven</a> 8–2 on 19 February 2012. After a decisive 2–2 draw against <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg II</a> at the 33rd matchday, the club missed out on promotion for the second time in the Regionalliga, finishing the season in 3rd place.
The 2012–13 season in the reformed <a href="Regionalliga%20Nordost">Regionalliga Nordost</a> began with major personnel changes. Former <a href="Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> head coach <a href="Ralf%20Rangnick">Ralf Rangnick</a> was introduced as the new sporting director. Coinciding with his arrival, he replaced head coach Peter Pacult with former <a href="SG%20Sonnenhof%20Gro%C3%9Faspach">SG Sonnenhof Großaspach</a> coach <a href="Alexander%20Zorniger">Alexander Zorniger</a>. The season proved more successful than the previous two. The club won the "Herbstmeister" title with two matchdays left of the first half of the season, after defeating <a href="FSV%20Zwickau">FSV Zwickau</a> 1–0 away. The team then secured first place in the 2012–13 Regionalliga Nordost at the 18th matchday, after the second placed club <a href="FC%20Carl%20Zeiss%20Jena">FC Carl Zeiss Jena</a> lost a match against <a href="Berliner%20AK%2007">Berliner AK 07</a> on 7 May 2013 and, as a consequence, were no longer able to overtake RB.
The 2012–13 Saxony Cup was another success. The club reached the final for the second time in club history and, as in 2011, the opponent was Chemnitzer FC. The team won the final on 15 May 2013 by 4–2 in front of 16,864 spectators at the Red Bull Arena. The crowd number set a new record for a Saxony Cup final, breaking the previous record from 2011. By winning the 2012–13 Saxony Cup, the club was also qualified to participate in the 2013–14 DFB-Pokal. As the winner of the 2012–13 Regionallig Nordost, RB Leipzig won a place in the qualification for the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>. The club was drawn against <a href="Sportfreunde%20Lotte">Sportfreunde Lotte</a> from the <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a>. RB Leipzig won the first leg on 29 May 2013 by 2–0. The match was played at the Red Bull Arena in front of 30,104 spectators, a crowd number which set a new record for matches in the 4th division.
The second leg was played on 2 June 2013 and ended 2–2 after two goals to RB Leipzig during extra time. The result meant that RB Leipzig had finally won promotion to the 3. Liga, after three seasons in the Regionalliga. In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20RB%20Leipzig%20season">2013–14 season</a>, RB Leipzig made its first appearance in the 3. Liga in club history. The club signed <a href="Anthony%20Jung">Anthony Jung</a> from <a href="FSV%20Frankfurt">FSV Frankfurt</a>, <a href="Tobias%20Willers">Tobias Willers</a> from Sportfreunde Lotte, <a href="Joshua%20Kimmich">Joshua Kimmich</a> from the U19 team of <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Luge">André Luge</a> from FSV Zwickau, <a href="Christos%20Papadimitriou%20%28footballer%29">Christos Papadimitriou</a> from <a href="AEK%20Athens">AEK Athens</a>, <a href="Yussuf%20Poulsen">Yussuf Poulsen</a> from <a href="Lyngby%20BK">Lyngby BK</a> and <a href="Denis%20Thomalla">Denis Thomalla</a> from <a href="TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim">TSG 1899 Hoffenheim</a> during the summer.
RB Leipzig was eliminated by FC Augsburg in the first round of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20DFB-Pokal">2013–14 DFB-Pokal</a> on 2 August 2013 after losing 0–2 at the Red Bull Arena. The defeat brought an end to a year-long series without defeat in competitive matches. The 2013–14 3. Liga had a more promising start. The team won its first match, against <a href="Hallescher%20FC">Hallescher FC</a> away, by 1–0 on 19 July 2013 and kept an undefeated streak until 31 August 2013, when the team lost 1–2 to first placed team <a href="SV%20Wehen%20Wiesbaden">SV Wehen Wiesbaden</a> away. On 5 October 2013, RB Leipzig again met the first placed team. SV Wehen Wiesbaden had lost its first-place position to <a href="1.%20FC%20Heidenheim">1. FC Heidenheim</a> only one week after its defeat of RB Leipzig. 1. FC Heidenheim would defend it until the end of the season. RB Leipzig defeated 1. FC Heidenheim by 2–0 after a convincing performance at the <a href="Voith-Arena">Voith-Arena</a> and climbed to third place. During the winter break, players Christos Papadimitriou, <a href="Juri%20Judt">Juri Judt</a>, Carsten Kammlott and <a href="Bastian%20Schulz">Bastian Schulz</a> left the team. In return, the team was joined by <a href="Diego%20Demme">Diego Demme</a> from <a href="SC%20Paderborn%2007">SC Paderborn 07</a>, <a href="Federico%20Palacios%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Federico Palacios Martínez</a> from <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a>, <a href="Mikko%20Sumusalo">Mikko Sumusalo</a> from <a href="HJK%20Helsinki">HJK Helsinki</a> and <a href="Georg%20Teigl">Georg Teigl</a> from <a href="FC%20Red%20Bull%20Salzburg">FC Red Bull Salzburg</a>.
After losing 1–2 away to <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a> on 1 February 2014, the team would not concede a single defeat for the rest of the season. A thrilling duel with <a href="SV%20Darmstadt%2098">SV Darmstadt 98</a> appeared, with both teams fighting for the crucial second place. The two teams met at the 35th matchday, on 19 April 2014. RB Leipzig came out as the winner, defeating SV Darmstadt 98 by 1–0 in front of 39,147 spectators at the Red Bull Arena. RB Leipzig secured the second place and direct promotion to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> two weeks later, after defeating last placed team <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a> 5–1 in front of a nearly sold out Red Bull Arena on 3 May 2014. The crowd of 42,713 spectators set a new club record.
By finishing the season in second place, RB Leipzig won promotion to the 2. Bundesliga and became the first team since the introduction of the 3. Liga to win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga after only one season. Following promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, the organization responsible for licensing was no longer the DFB, but instead the <a href="Deutsche%20Fu%C3%9Fball%20Liga">German Football League (DFL)</a>. The DFL announced its first decision in the licensing process on 22 April 2014. RB Leipzig was to be given a license for the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%202.%20Bundesliga">2014–15 2. Bundesliga season</a>, but only under certain conditions. Criticism mounted that the club lacked in participation, that club management was too concentrated in only a handful of people and that the club was not independent enough from Red Bull GmbH. To ensure independence and improve participation, the DFL set up three requirements that the club had to meet in order to obtain a license for the 2014–15 2. Bundesliga season. One of the requirements was to redesign the crest, as the crest too closely resembled the corporate logo of Red Bull GmbH. A second requirement was to change the composition of the club's organizational bodies. A third requirement was to lower the membership fees and open up the association for new members. The German legal magazine "Legal Tribune Online" assessed all three requirements set up by the DFL as legally questionable.
RB Leipzig filed an appeal on 30 April 2014. Sporting director Ralf Rangnick appeared in media and expressed his willingness to reach a compromise with the DFL, saying that important is not what is written on the jersey, but what is inside. The appeal was rejected in a second decision by the DFL on 8 May 2014. Red Bull GmbH owner Dietrich Mateschitz spoke out in media, openly criticizing the decision by the DFL. He described the requirements as a "<a href="decapitation">decapitation</a> request" and categorically rejected another season in the 3. Liga, ultimately threatening to end the project in Leipzig if the license was not given.
RB Leipzig filed a second appeal on 12 May 2014. The DFL licensing committee was set to make a decision on the second appeal on 15 May 2014, before making its final decision on 28 May 2014. Sporting director Ralf Rangnick confirmed that the club was still in talks with the DFL and expressed optimism around the license. On 15 May 2014, a compromise was announced. The compromise meant that the club had to redesign its crest and ensure that club management was independent from Red Bull GmbH.
The club signed numerous players before the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20RB%20Leipzig%20season">2014–15 season</a>, among them <a href="Rani%20Khedira">Rani Khedira</a> from <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>, <a href="Lukas%20Klostermann">Lukas Klostermann</a> from <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a>, <a href="Marcel%20Sabitzer">Marcel Sabitzer</a> from <a href="FC%20Red%20Bull%20Salzburg">FC Red Bull Salzburg</a>, <a href="Terrence%20Boyd">Terrence Boyd</a> from <a href="Rapid%20Wien">Rapid Wien</a> and <a href="Massimo%20Bruno">Massimo Bruno</a> from <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">RSC Anderlecht</a>. Several players also left the team. Massimo Bruno and Marcel Sabitzer were immediately transferred on loan to FC Red Bull Salzburg. Fabian Bredlow was transferred on loan to <a href="FC%20Liefering">FC Liefering</a>, André Luge was transferred on loan to <a href="SV%20Elversberg">SV Elversberg</a> and Thiago Rockenbach Silva joined Hertha BSC II as a free agent. The club spent an estimated sum of approximately 12 million euros on new players during the summer of 2014. The sum was large enough to put the club in 8th place of all clubs in the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, thus spending more than half of all clubs in the first division.
RB Leipzig played a series of friendly matches during the 2014–15 pre-season. On 18 July 2014, the team defeated <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">Paris Saint-Germain</a> 4–2 in front of 35,796 spectators and 150 accredited journalists at the Red Bull Arena. The first goal was scored by Terrence Boyd, scoring his second goal in his second match for his new club. Terrence Boyd received the jersey of <a href="Zlatan%20Ibrahimovi%C4%87">Zlatan Ibrahimović</a> from Paris Saint-Germain after the match. On 26 July 2014, the team defeated <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> with 2–0 at the <a href="Stadion%20der%20Freundschaft%20%28Gera%29">Stadion der Freundschaft</a> in <a href="Gera">Gera</a>. Both goals were scored by Yussuf Poulsen.
The 2014–15 2. Bundesliga season began with 0–0 draw against <a href="VfR%20Aalen">VfR Aalen</a> on 2 August 2014, followed up by a couple of wins and another draw. The first defeat in the league came at the 6th matchday, losing 1–2 against <a href="1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">1. FC Union Berlin</a> at the Red Bull Arena on 21 September 2014. After the 7th matchday, the club stood at second place in the league. RB Leipzig was drawn against <a href="SC%20Paderborn%2007">SC Paderborn</a> in the first round of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20DFB-Pokal">2014–15 DFB-Pokal</a>. The team won the match with 2–1 on extra time at the Red Bull Arena on 16 August 2014. In the second round, the club faced <a href="FC%20Erzgebirge%20Aue">FC Erzgebirge Aue</a>. The team won the match with 3–1 on extra time at the Red Bull Arena on 29 October 2015, and qualified for the round of 16 for first time in club history. RB Leipzig then released its own club magazine "Klub" on 6 October 2014.
After a series of disappointing results, the club had dropped down to 7th place by the 13th matchday. On 23 November 2014, RB Leipzig defeated <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a> 4–1 in front of 38,660 spectators at the Red Bull Arena. Two goals were scored by Terrence Boyd and the club climbed to 5th place. The success, however, was followed by a draw against <a href="SV%20Sandhausen">SV Sandhausen</a>. On 7 December 2014, the team met first placed team <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">FC Ingolstadt</a>. RB Leipzig lost 0–1, and the result meant that the club now stood at 8th place. RB Leipzig strengthened the team during the winter break by signing <a href="Omer%20Damari">Omer Damari</a> from Austria Wien, <a href="Emil%20Forsberg">Emil Forsberg</a> from <a href="Malm%C3%B6%20FF">Malmö FF</a> and players <a href="Rodnei">Rodnei</a> and <a href="Yordy%20Reyna">Yordy Reyna</a> from FC Red Bull Salzburg. The club spent an estimated sum of 10,7 million euros on new players during the winter break, a sum which covered almost all transfer expenditures during the period for the whole of 2. Bundesliga.
On 6 February 2015, the club lost 2–0 to <a href="FC%20Erzgebirge%20Aue">Erzgebirge Aue</a>. As a consequence, the club had now played four matches without a win and had lost contact with the top placed teams. On the following Tuesday evening, the club summoned Alexander Zorninger to a meeting, and on Tuesday night, the club took the decision to part ways with him after the season. The decision had been taken by the club management in consultation with Red Bull GmbH owner Dietrich Mateschitz. The next morning, Alexander Zorniger announced his own decision to leave immediately. The club received criticismfor its decision. Under Alexander Zorniger, the club had risen from the Regionalliga to the 2. Bundesliga. Some media considered the decision to be a merciless one. Incumbent RB Leipzig U17 coach <a href="Achim%20Beierlorzer">Achim Beierlorzer</a> was announced as interim head coach for the rest of the season.
On 5 March 2015, RB Leipzig met <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> in the third round of the 2014–15 DFB-Pokal. The club was eliminated after being defeated 2–0 at the Red Bull Arena. The match was attended by 43,348 spectators. It was the first time in club history that the stadium had been completely sold out. The preferred candidate of sporting director Ralf Rangnick as new head coach from the summer was former <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">Mainz 05</a> coach <a href="Thomas%20Tuchel">Thomas Tuchel</a>, but the negotiations with Tuchel failed. Another candidate was <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> junior coach <a href="Sascha%20Lewandowski">Sascha Lewandowski</a>, but he too declined the offer. In May 2015, sporting director Ralf Rangnick was himself announced as new head coach from the summer, with Achim Beierlorzer as his assistant. Ralf Rangnick was planned to serve this double job for one season. RB Leipzig finished the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%202.%20Bundesliga">2014–15 2. Bundesliga season</a> in fifth place.
Before the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20RB%20Leipzig%20season">2015–16 season</a>, RB Leipzig invested further in strengthening the team, signing <a href="Davie%20Selke">Davie Selke</a> from <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>, <a href="At%C4%B1n%C3%A7%20Nukan">Atınç Nukan</a> from <a href="Be%C5%9Fikta%C5%9F%20J.K.">Beşiktaş</a>, <a href="Marcel%20Halstenberg">Marcel Halstenberg</a> from FC St. Pauli and <a href="Willi%20Orban">Willi Orban</a> from <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a>. Selke was signed for an estimated €8 million, Nukan for an estimated €5 million and Halstenberg for an estimated €3 million. Meanwhile, <a href="Joshua%20Kimmich">Joshua Kimmich</a> was sold to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="Rodnei">Rodnei</a> left to join <a href="TSV%201860%20M%C3%BCnchen">1860 Munich</a> as free agent. RB Leipzig also made transfers with its unofficial sister club, FC Red Bull Salzburg. As at several times in the past, three players were signed on a free transfer, among them the <a href="Austria%20national%20football%20team">Austrian national</a> <a href="Stefan%20Ilsanker%20%28footballer%29">Stefan Ilsanker</a>. They were joined by Massimo Bruno and Marcel Sabitzer, returning to RB Leipzig from being on loan. These transfers provoked anger among the fans of FC Red Bull Salzburg. For several years, FC Red Bull Salzburg had transferred some of its best players to RB Leipzig. Fans of FC Red Bull Salzburg were heard singing chants against RB Leipzig during a game in the <a href="Austrian%20Cup">ÖFB-Cup</a> in April 2015, after Austrian media had reported that Stefan Ilsanker could move to Leipzig during the summer.
The signing of Davie Selke was record breaking, as it made him the most expensive player ever signed in the 2. Bundesliga's history. In total, the club spent a sum of approximately €18.6 million on new players during the summer of 2015, more than all other clubs in the 2. Bundesliga together. During the pre-season 2015–16, RB Leipzig defeated <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> 5–4 in <a href="Bischofshofen">Bischofshofen</a> on 8 July 2015, and <a href="FC%20Rubin%20Kazan">Rubin Kazan</a> 1–0 in <a href="Leogang">Leogang</a> on 12 July 2015. The team then beat <a href="Hapoel%20Tel%20Aviv%20F.C.">Hapoel Tel Aviv</a> 3–0 at the Red Bull Arena on 18 July 2015.
The club was drawn against <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a> in the first round of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20DFB-Pokal">2015–16 DFB-Pokal</a>. The match was played at the <a href="Stadion%20an%20der%20Bremer%20Br%C3%BCcke">Osnatel-Arena</a> in <a href="Osnabr%C3%BCck">Osnabrück</a> on 10 August 2015. After Osnabrück scored in the first minute, the home fans celebrated so violently that barriers and safety net partially collapsed and the match had to be interrupted. The match was restarted and Osnabrück led the match into the second half. In the 71st minute, referee Martin Petersen was badly hit in the head by a lighter, thrown from the home stand. The lighter had been thrown after Petersen had tried to resolve an argument between Davie Selke and Osnabrück substitute <a href="Michael%20Hohnstedt">Michael Hohnstedt</a>, resulting from a controversial situation in the Osnabrück <a href="penalty%20area">penalty area</a>. The match was again interrupted, and later cancelled. RB Leipzig offered a replay, but the DFB decided the match to be counted as lost by Osnabrück 0–2. RB Leipzig later decided to waive 20,000 euros of the 50,500 euros VfL Osnabrück owed the club for its share of the revenues from the match. RB Leipzig also allowed the payment of the remaining 30,500 to be postponed until the next year.
In the midst of the <a href="2015%20European%20migrant%20crisis">2015 European migrant crisis</a>, the club, staff, players and fans of RB Leipzig showed support for refugees. In August 2015, RB Leipzig donated €50,000 to the City of Leipzig for its work with helping asylum seekers. The club also sold 60 containers from its training center, including sanitary facilities, to the city, in order to serve as accommodation for asylum seekers. The club had originally invested around €500,000 in the containers. Moreover, the club became patrons of the initiative "Willkommen im Fußball", giving refugee children the opportunity to play football. Staff and players of RB Leipzig collected and donated sporting equipment and private clothes to refugees. Also sporting director and head coach Ralf Rangnick participated in the donation, with personal concern for the commitment, citing his own background as being a child to refugees. His parents had met in a refugee camp at <a href="Glauchau">Glauchau</a>, his father had fled from <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a> and his mother from <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a>. By an initiative of fans, RB Leipzig invited refugees on free admission to watch its home match against <a href="SC%20Paderborn">SC Paderborn</a> on 11 September 2015. 450 refugees attended the match, and they were met and accompanied by 200 fans beforehand.
RB Leipzig advanced to the second round of the DFB-Pokal, being eliminated after losing 3–0 to a strong playing <a href="SpVgg%20Unterhaching">SpVgg Unterhaching</a> from the <a href="Regionalliga%20Bayern">Regionalliga Bayern</a> at the <a href="Alpenbauer%20Sportpark">Alpenbauer Sportpark</a> on 27 October 2015. After defeating SV Sandhausen 2–1 away at the 13th matchday on 1 November 2015, RB Leipzig stood at first place in the league. The position was however quickly lost already at the next matchday, with the team being surpassed by <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a> and <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a>. But, following a series of wins, the team returned to the leading position on 13 December 2015. RB Leipzig made only few transfers during the winter break. Defender Tim Sebastian, who had been in the team since 2010 and who had once served as captain, left to join SC Paderborn, and midfielder <a href="Zsolt%20Kalm%C3%A1r">Zsolt Kalmár</a> left to join <a href="FSV%20Frankfurt">FSV Frankfurt</a> on loan.
RB Leipzig held the leading position in the league until the 27th matchday, when it was again lost to SC Freiburg, after the team suffered a 3–1 defeat away against 1.FC Nürnberg on 20 March 2016. The team now stood at second place in the league, only three points ahead of <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> in third place. RB Leipzig then recorded two straight wins and expanded the distance to six points. But with only three matches left of the league season, the distance had shrunk to four points. RB Leipzig finally secured a second place in the league and direct promotion to the Bundesliga at the 33rd matchday, after defeating <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a> 2–0 in front of 42,559 spectators at the Red Bull Arena on 8 May 2016. The promotion was celebrated together with 20,000 supporters at the Market Square in front of the <a href="Old%20Town%20Hall%20%28Leipzig%29">Old Town Hall</a> in central Leipzig on 16 May 2016. Leipzig Mayor <a href="Burkhard%20Jung">Burkhard Jung</a> received the team before the celebration.
At the end of the season, Ralf Rangnick was to resign as head coach, in order to be able to focus on his job as sporting director. German media had during the season speculated on several potential candidates for new head coach, including <a href="Markus%20Gisdol">Markus Gisdol</a>, <a href="Sandro%20Schwarz">Sandro Schwarz</a>, <a href="Jocelyn%20Gourvennec">Jocelyn Gourvennec</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Weiler">René Weiler</a>, and, notably, <a href="Markus%20Weinzierl">Markus Weinzierl</a>. On 6 May 2016, <a href="Ralph%20Hasenh%C3%BCttl">Ralph Hasenhüttl</a> was announced as new head coach. Ralph Hasenhüttl had been head coach of <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">FC Ingolstadt 04</a> since October 2013, having brought the team from the bottom of the 2. Bundesliga to the Bundesliga, and also managed to defend the spot in the top tier during the 2015–16 season.
2016–present: Bundesliga era.
RB Leipzig remained undefeated in the first thirteen league matches of the 2016–17 season, breaking a record for the longest undefeated streak of a promoted team to the Bundesliga. The team finished the 11th matchday in first place, and became the first team from the <a href="new%20states%20of%20Germany">area of former East Germany</a> to hold the leading position since the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Bundesliga">1991–92 Bundesliga season</a>, when <a href="Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a> stood at first place on 31 August 1991 and held the position for three matchdays, relinquishing it after a loss against FC Ingolstadt.
RB Leipzig became the first Bundesliga debutant, since <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, to qualify for a European tournament, doing so with a 4–0 win against <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a> on 15 April 2017. They were also the first team from the former East Germany to qualify for a European tournament since 1. FC Union Berlin qualified for the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Cup">2001–02 UEFA Cup</a>. Subsequently, Leipzig qualified for the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2017–18 UEFA Champions League</a> after beating <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> 4–1 at the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a> on 6 May 2017, two days before the anniversary of the club's promotion to Bundesliga. 
The following season, Leipzig finished in 6th position and also reached the quarterfinals of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2017–18 UEFA Europa League</a> competition, after being transferred from the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2017–18 UEFA Champions League</a> group stage, which was finished in 3rd position. On 16 May 2018, <a href="Ralph%20Hasenh%C3%BCttl">Ralph Hasenhüttl</a> resigned as head coach, after an extension of his contract was denied. Before the next season, Rangnick was announced as new coach for one year, to be followed by <a href="Julian%20Nagelsmann">Julian Nagelsmann</a> by the beginning of the 2019–20 season.
RB Leipzig finished the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Bundesliga">2018–19 Bundesliga</a> season in 3rd position, with a total of 66 points. This ensured them qualification in the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2019–20 UEFA Champions League</a>. In addition, a win against <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> on 23 April 2019, RB Leipzig reached the DFB-Pokal final for the first time, where they faced <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> on 25 May. Bayern Munich thrashed RB Leipzig 3–0. On 1 June 2019, Rangnick announced his resignation as sporting director of RB Leipzig after seven years and moved to the Red Bull company as "Head of Sport and Development Soccer". His successor as sporting director was Markus Krösche.
In the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, RB Leipzig won their group ahead of <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a>, <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> and <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">Zenit Saint Petersburg</a>. After beating <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 4–0 on aggregate in the Round of 16, Leipzig then had a 2–1 win against <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20de%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> in the quarter-final, with a late goal of American midfielder <a href="Tyler%20Adams">Tyler Adams</a>, to reach the semi-final. But <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">Paris Saint-Germain</a> thrashed RB Leipzig 3–0 in the semi-final.
Under coach <a href="Domenico%20Tedesco">Domenico Tedesco</a>, RB Leipzig reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2021–22 UEFA Europa League</a>, in which they were eliminated by <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> 3–2 on aggregate, and won their first major title in the <a href="2022%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">DFB-Pokal Final</a> 4–2 on penalties against <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a>. On 30 July 2022, RB Leipzig faced <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in their first <a href="2022%20DFL-Supercup">DFL Supercup</a> at the Red Bull Arena where they lost 5–3. On 7 September 2022, Tedesco was sacked following a 4–1 home defeat against <a href="FC%20Shakhtar%20Donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a> in the opening match of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2022–23 UEFA Champions League</a>. On 3 June 2023, RB Leipzig won their second consecutive <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> title after a 2–0 win against <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in the final. They also won their maiden <a href="DFL-Supercup">DFL-Supercup</a> on August 13, 2023, beating Bayern Munich 3-0, a revenge for the previous year's Supercup loss.
Colours and crest.
RB Leipzig play in the traditional red and white colours of Red Bull football teams. All crests proposed at the club's founding were rejected by the Saxony Football Association (SFV), as they were considered copies of the corporate logo of Red Bull GmbH. The team therefore played its inaugural season in 2009–10 without a crest. RB Leipzig later proposed a new crest, which was eventually accepted by the SFV in May 2010. The crest was slightly different from the crests used by other Red Bull football teams. The two bulls had been altered in shape and a few strokes added. The crest was used from the 2010–11 Regionalliga season until the end of the 2013–14 3. Liga season. The German Football League (DFL) rejected it however, during the license procedure for the 2014–15 2. Bundesliga season. As part of a compromise with the DFL, the club agreed to redesign its crest and introduced the current crest. The current crest is significantly different from the crests used by other Red Bull football teams, although it is identical to the modified crest used by <a href="FC%20Red%20Bull%20Salzburg">FC Red Bull Salzburg</a> for international matches and due to <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> regulations. The yellow sun has been changed in favor of a football and the initials of "RasenBallsport" have been relocated to the bottom of the crest and are no longer highlighted in red.
Stadium.
RB Leipzig played its inaugural season in 2009–10 at the Stadion am Bad in Markranstädt. The stadium held 5,000 seats and was the traditional home ground of SSV Markranstädt. But the plans were that the first team would quickly move to the far larger Zentralstadion, hopefully in 2010, after an advance to the Regionalliga. Red Bull GmbH reserved the naming right to the stadium at the club's founding, meaning that the name could not be sold to anyone else. The company negotiated the acquisition of the naming right during the successful 2009–10 season and the proposed new name was approved by the City of Leipzig on 25 March 2010. Red Bull GmbH then acquired the naming right and the Zentralstadion was renamed "Red Bull Arena" on 1 July 2010. The contract runs until 2040. The inauguration was held on 24 July 2010, in a friendly match against Schalke 04, in front of 21,566 spectators.
Red Bull Arena had a capacity of 44,345 seats during the 2014–15 season. In March 2015, RB Leipzig announced that it was going to invest 5 million euros in a redevelopment of the stadium, including an expansion of the VIP area, pressbox and wheelchair spaces. It also included two new larger <a href="Light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> score boards and refurbished player facilities. The VIP area was expanded from 700 seats to approximately 1400 seats. The capacity of Red Bull Arena was reduced to 42,959 seats before the 2015–16 season, due to redevelopment of various stadium areas.
The Red Bull Arena was an all-seater stadium for a long time. Home supporters are located in sector B. During the general meeting of the supporters' union in 2014, the assembly made a demand to convert sector B into a standing area. However, it was considered impossible to convert sector B into a standing area at the time, for structural reasons. Sector B was eventually converted into a standing area in the 2021–22 season.
Attendances.
The 29 July 2011 first round 3–2 victory over <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> was the club's first appearance in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20DFB-Pokal">2011–12 DFB-Pokal</a>; the 31,212 spectators gathered marked a club attendance record for the Red Bull Arena. The record did not stand long though; on 25 October 2011 Leipzig were defeated 1–0 by <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a>, this second-round game of the DFB-Pokal set a new record attendance of 34,341 spectators.
The last home game of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%203.%20Liga">2013–14 3. Liga season</a> on 3 May 2014 was a chance for RB Leipzig to secure direct promotion to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>; Leipzig romped home emphatically winning 5–1 against <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a> in a near-sell out capacity Red Bull Arena, in front of a record 42,713 spectators. The 43,348 spectators who watched the third round of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20DFB-Pokal">2014–15 DFB-Pokal</a> against VfL Wolfsburg on 4 March 2015, sold out the Red Bull Arena for the first time, setting the current club record for a match at the Red Bull Arena as of 2016.
RB Leipzig holds two attendance records. The 2011 <a href="Saxony%20Cup">Saxony Cup</a> final against <a href="Chemnitzer%20FC">Chemnitzer FC</a> on 1 June 2011 at the Red Bull Arena was attended by 13,958 spectators. The attendance set a new record for a Saxony Cup final. The record was broken two years later, again in a final between RB Leipzig and Chemnizer FC. The 2013 Saxony Cup final against Chemnitzer FC on 15 May 2013 at the Red Bull Arena was attended by 16,864 spectators. The second attendance record held by RB Leipzig was set during the 2012–13 season, in the qualification for the 3. Liga. The qualifying match against <a href="Sportfreunde%20Lotte">Sportfreunde Lotte</a> on 29 May 2013 at the Red Bull Arena was attended by 30,104 spectators. The attendance set a new record for a match in the fourth tier of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>.
RB Leipzig played its hundredth match at the Red Bull Arena on 4 October 2015, against <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>. At that point, the club reported a total attendance of 1,464,215 spectators, or an average of 14,643 spectators, for matches at the Red Bull Arena.
Their first Bundesliga home match was played on 10 September 2016 versus <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> in front of 42,558 spectators. In their debut season, the team averaged 41,454 spectators, or 97% of the stadium's capacity.
Expansion.
In October 2014, German media reported that the club wanted to expand the Red Bull Arena to 55,000 seats for future first division Bundesliga play. An expansion to 55,000 seats would make the stadium one of the ten largest football venues in Germany. Who was to finance such an expansion remained unclear. German media considered that a possible option was that Red Bull GmbH buy the stadium to make the investments itself, but it was also considered unlikely that the current owner would be prepared to sell the stadium, which had just turned profitable.
The club had previously reserved an area near the <a href="Bundesautobahn%2014">A14 motorway</a> north of Leipzig, close to the <a href="Leipzig/Halle%20Airport">Leipzig/Halle Airport</a>, which could be used to build a completely new stadium. It could also be used to put pressure on the current owner of the Red Bull Arena to agree to an expansion. In March 2015, German media reported the club considered building a new stadium on the area north of Leipzig. It could be modeled after the <a href="Veltins-Arena">Veltins-Arena</a> in <a href="Gelsenkirchen">Gelsenkirchen</a> or the <a href="Esprit%20Arena">Esprit Arena</a> in <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, with a significantly larger capacity than Red Bull arena, possibly up to 80,000 seats.
The current owner of Red Bull Arena, Michael Kölmel, commented on plans to build a new stadium in an interview in August 2015. He pointed out how a new stadium on the outskirts of Leipzig could be detrimental to fan culture, and said that Red Bull Arena could be expanded to 55,000 seats, or even more.
In October 2015, expansion of the Red Bull Arena was back on the agenda. New plans were made to expand the stadium to 57,000 seats, involving Viennese architect Albert Wimmer. Reconstruction could start over the summer break of 2016. In January 2016, the club decided to put the plans on hold, at least until 2017.
In February 2016, German newspaper "<a href="Leipziger%20Volkszeitung">Leipziger Volkszeitung</a>" reported that club management again considered the possibility of building a new stadium with a capacity of 80,000 seats north of Leipzig. However, a prerequisite for such a project would be that ticket demand exceed the supply of seats in the Red Bull Arena significantly and sustainably. A move to a new stadium could be possible in 2020, when the club's current contract to lease the Red Bull Arena expires.
In December 2016, RB Leipzig offered that the stadium would be sold by former owner Michael Kölmel to the club to continue the plans from the 2015 agenda. Due to the transfer of the arena into ownership of Red Bull, a new stadium would not be pursued. It was planned, that the stadium would expand to a total of 53,840 seats as of summer 2021, beginning from November 2018, when construction works started. However, the plans were changed during construction and the expansion work was completed in 2021 with a total capacity of 47,069 spectators, of which 37,069 can be seated, at national competitions.
Training center.
In 2010, Red Bull announced its intention to engage long term in Leipzig. In this context the club sought a location for a training center and a <a href="Youth%20system">youth academy</a>. Towards the end of the year, the club made concrete plans to invest 30 million euros in a training center comprising six pitches, offices and a youth academy. The training center was to be located at Cottaweg, partly on the area of the naturally protected <a href="riparian%20forest">riparian forest</a> Leipziger Auwald and the site of the traditional fair Leipziger Kleinmesse. The plans met objections and concerns from environmental organizations and from the current users of the area, a Leipzig fairground association and the football club BSV Schönau 1983. After negotiations, the City of Leipzig agreed to the plans on 15 December 2010. RB Leipzig and the city of Leipzig later announced that the club was going to invest in an area of 92,000 square meters.
The construction was to be carried out in two phases and began in March 2011. During the first phase, three natural turf pitches, one artificial turf pitch and an artificial hill for physical exercises were built. All four pitches were installed with floodlights, irrigation system and soil heating. Pitch one was also provided with four 38-meter masts producing HD-compatible lightning for optimal television broadcasts. Locker rooms, sanitary facilities and weight rooms were installed in 60 containers, totaling 720 square meters. The first section of the training center was opened in August 2011.
The second phase of construction began in January 2014. The plans for the second phase were set to create one of Germany's largest training centers for an estimated cost of 35 million euros. Involved in the project was the <a href="Dortmund">Dortmund</a> based architect Christoph Helbich, who had previously been involved in the building of a new training center for <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>. For the second phase, the training center was to be expanded with two pitches, an area for goalkeeping practices and a three-story 13,500 square meters sports complex, meant to offer amenities for all RB Leipzig teams, from the U8 team to the professional team. In addition, pitch one was to be provided with a covered grandstand with at least 1,000 seats, for A- and B-junior matches.
The new sports complex was opened in September 2015 and taken in use by the professional team and six junior teams, from U14 to the reserve team. It contains an 800 square meters indoor hall, an indoor <a href="tartan%20track">tartan track</a> for sprint exercises, weight rooms, cold chambers, a spa area, medical facilities and individual relaxation rooms for each professional player. It also houses a media center, new offices, a <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> for 50 youth players and a café for parents and fans. The RB Leipzig training center with its sports complex is considered one of the most unique and modern in Germany.
Constructed in the spring of 2016 was a covered grandstand with 1,000 seats, an area for motor skills-training and a parking area. The artificial hill for physical exercises, humorously called the "<a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a> Memorial Hill", was also reconstructed.
The club has already plans for even further expansions of the training center. The club wants to build an additional pitch to the south of the training center. Such expansion would require more ground from the Leipziger Kleinmesse, and is therefore met with several objections. More certain is a future expansion to the north of the training center. This area is used by the football club BSV Schönau 1983 and the tennis club TC Grün-Weiß Leipzig. BSV Schönau 1983 has a contract to lease the area until 2026. The club ceded parts of its grounds to RB Leipzig in 2011. For this, the club received compensation. In total, RB Leipzig spent 900,000 euros for the construction of new grounds for BSC Schönau 1983. The area currently leased by BSV Schönau 1983 is already pledged to RB Leipzig when the lease contract ends in 2026.
Supporters.
Fanclubs and minor ultras.
RB Leipzig has 68 official fanclubs as of August 2023. The first two to become registered as official fanclubs were "L.E Bulls" and "Bulls Club", both registered in 2009. L.E Bulls is the oldest official fanclub, but Bulls Club claims to be the biggest. There are also several non-official fanclubs, such as "Rasenballisten" and "Fraktion Red Pride". RB Leipzig also has a minor <a href="ultras">ultras</a> scene, with groups such as "Red Aces" and "Lecrats". The German newspaper "<a href="Mitteldeutsche%20Zeitung">Mitteldeutsche Zeitung</a>" reported that RB Leipzig had 5,000 organized supporters by March 2016.
Fan clubs and supporter groups are organized into a union called "Fanverband RB Leipzig Fans", which was founded in 2013. This is an umbrella organization for official fan clubs, unofficial fan clubs and other groups. As of 2016, 25 supporter groups were organized in that union. Each group in the union is represented by two representatives. The representatives of the supporter groups meet every 4 to 6 weeks. The union also holds a general meeting once per year. Those who are not members of a supporter group are allowed to attend the general meeting. The union is represented by five to seven "fan representatives", elected every second year. A maximum of five "fan representatives" are elected by the representatives of the supporter groups, two additional "fan representatives" are elected by the general assembly. The "fan representatives" are permitted to speak with club officials to communicate ideas and criticism from the supporter base. In order to divide the work of the "fan representatives", the union has created several working groups. The first general meeting was held in November 2014, and gathered 350 supporters. "Present were also club officials", such as general manager Ulrich Wolter.
Several German newspapers have noted the emergence of distinctly nonconformist supporter groups at the Red Bull Arena. In January 2012, "<a href="Leipziger%20Internet%20Zeitung">Leipziger Internet Zeitung</a>" reported on the appearance of ultra group Red Aces. The group members were said to see themselves as "Rasenballisten" and determined not to leave the supporter base solely to Red Bull GmbH. In May 2014, "<a href="Der%20Tagesspiegel">Der Tagesspiegel</a>" reported on supporter group IG Rasenballisten. The group was said to highly value the name "RasenBallsport" and to be committed to give the club an identity beyond that offered by Red Bull GmbH. In the forefront, the group put the city of Leipzig. In April 2015, "<a href="Die%20Zeit">Die Zeit</a>" reported further on this subject, particularly supporter groups IG Rasenballisten and Lecrats. Their central idea was described as "Rasenballismus", stressing the Leipzig identity and the importance of impassioned fans. Lecrats was described as geared towards the anti-commercial values of the ultra culture and as critics of Red Bull GmbH. IG Rasenballisten and the ultra groups were said to consciously avoid the reductions that apply to official fanclubs and to reject official club merchandise and the commercial name of the stadium. In February 2015, the supporter group IG Rasenballisten became a registered voluntary association. The group had previously functioned as an interest community for other groups and individuals in the Red Bull Arena. The "<a href="Mitteldeutsche%20Zeitung">Mitteldeutsche Zeitung</a>" reported that the group describes itself as uniting fanatical and critical fans of RB Leipzig. Members of Rasenballisten said that the group does not hesitate to criticize Red Bull GmbH, when found necessary, and stated that the identity of a club cannot solely rely on the main sponsor. The group also makes a clear political statement, "Together for Leipzig – Rasenball against Racism", a statement which can be found on scarves sold by the group, and on a banner inside the stadium. RB Leipzig had previously refused to allow supporter groups such as Rasenballisten to sell their own merchandise at the stadium, but after lengthy negotiations, the club gave permission.
The ultra group Red Aces took position against "Legida", the local offshoot of "<a href="Pegida">Pegida</a>", at the beginning of 2015. In an open letter to the club, the stadium operator, the Mayor of Leipzig and the citizens of Leipzig in January 2015, the group asked for support against a planned demonstration by Legida. The demonstration was set to begin near the Red Bull Arena, and the group specifically asked for the stadium lights to be switched off at the time of the demonstration. The stadium operator decided to support the initiative and agreed to switch off the lighting. Red Aces had also previously asked the club for permission to display banners against racism and Legida during the last home game of 2014. The club refused to approve the requested banners, according to Red Aces because the club did not want politics in the stadium. Despite the ban, the group displayed a banner directed towards Legida, a banner that described the city of Leipzig as diverse, cosmopolitan and tolerant. In response to the demonstrations by Legida, the anti-racist action group "Rasenball gegen Rassismus" was founded by initiative of supporter groups Red Aces, Lecrats, Rabauken – Block 31 and IG Rasenballisten in January 2015. Before the home match against <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">SpVgg Greuther Fürth</a> on 3 August 2015, Red Aces again asked for permission to display a banner against Legida, with the text "Ligaspiel und Legida – der Montag ist zum Kotzen da". The club refused to approve the requested banner. During the home match against <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a> on 23 August 2015, Red Aces defied the supposed ban on anti-racist banners in the stadium through displaying a banner with a clear anti-Nazi message. Sporting director Ralf Rangnick later said that there was no ban against anti-racist messages in the stadium, stating that the banner was prohibited before the home match against SpVgg Greuther Fürth because it contained abusive language, and that the club would agree if someone wanted to display a banner with a message such as "RBL Fans against Racism".
Fans at away sides.
RB Leipzig supporters travelled in numbers to the first away match of 2016, against FC St. Pauli on 12 February 2016. Nearly 2,500 RB Leipzig supporters made its way to the <a href="Millerntorstadion">Millerntorstadion</a> and displayed a red and white flag <a href="tifo">tifo</a> at the match start. A higher number of RB Leipzig supporters accompanied the team to <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> one month later. The away match against <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> on 20 March 2016 at the <a href="Grundig-Stadion">Grundig-Stadion</a> was attended by 2,800 RB Leipzig supporters, according to club statistics. The number set a new club record for away supporters, which was broken in the first two Bundesliga seasons. More than 7,000 supporters attended away matches in Dortmund, Munich and Berlin, with a one-year record at the away match in Berlin, when 8,500 supporters of RBL gathered to watch their team qualify for the UEFA Champions League. One year later, more than 9,000 fans travelled for the last away game of the 2017–18 season in Berlin.
Fanprojekt Leipzig.
The organization "Fanprojekt Leipzig" was founded in 2011 by initiative of the city of Leipzig and is run by Outlaw gGmbH, full name Outlaw gemeinnützige Gesellschaft für Kinder- und Jugendhilfe mbH. Outlaw gGmbH is a <a href="M%C3%BCnster">Münster</a>-based non-profit company for child and youth welfare. The basic framework of the Fanprojekt Leipzig was concluded by the City of Leipzig, the Free State of Saxony and the German Football Association (DFB), and the organization receives funding from the City of Leipzig and the DFB.
Fanprojekt Leipzig is an organization for young football fans of different clubs in Leipzig, and works as an independent institution towards the different clubs. The main areas for the organization are promoting a positive supporter culture, violence prevention, help for young supporters in problem situations and establishing communication between all parties involved, such as supporters, clubs, police and law enforcement. Fanprojekt Leipzig is part of a network of similar Fanprojekts in numerous German cities. The different Fanprojekts are supported by a national coordination office (KOS).
Fanprojekt Leipzig runs a number of centers in Leipzig used for purposes such as recreational activities, content projects, painting and creation of minor choreographies, and as meeting places. For each club, the organization offers a social worker or pedagogue who works exclusively with supporters of that club. The organization carries out a variety of recreational and educational activities, including sporting activities, creative projects, readings and discussions and educational programs. The organization has presence during match days, where it is available for personal contact by supporters, police and law enforcement, with the aim to be able to mediate between the parties and have a de-escalating effect.
RB Leipzig entered a cooperation agreement with Fanprojekt Leipzig in 2013. The cooperation agreement involves collaboration in eight categories, involving both home and away matches, as well as anti-racism work. The detailed cooperation agreement was by then a novelty in Germany. In addition, the RB Leipzig formed a stadium ban commission, in which Fanprojekt Leipzig provides advice to the club. Fanprojekt Leipzig has also arranged a number of events, in which supporters can discuss the development of the supporter scene, and whose results are presented for the club.
Organization and finance.
Association.
RasenballSport Leipzig e.V is a <a href="Eingetragener%20Verein">registered voluntary association</a>. Its executive body is the "<a href="Vorstand">Vorstand</a>", the management board. The management board is appointed by the "Ehrenrat", the honorary board. It is also subordinated to the "Aufsichtsrat", the <a href="supervisory%20board">supervisory board</a>. The honorary board is elected directly by club members at the general meeting.
Significant organizational changes were made in 2014, following requirements set up by the German Football League (DFL). One of the requirements was to change the composition of organizational bodies. Both the management board and the honorary board had been composed by either employees or agents of Red Bull. This effectively contradicted fundamental principles of the <a href="50%2B1%20rule">50+1 rule</a>, as interpreted by the DFL, and which aims to forbid the influence of third parties on the sporting decisions of a club. As a part of a compromise with the DFL, the club made a binding declaration that it said was intended to ensure that the management board would be occupied by a majority of persons independent of Red Bull.
In addition, a supervisory board was added. The honorary board had performed tasks normally performed by a separate controlling organizational body. These functions were now transferred to a newly created supervisory board, capable of performing these tasks independently. The club decided to transfer the former members of the honorary board to the newly created supervisory board.
The association is responsible for men's junior teams from U8 to U14 and all women's football teams.
Membership.
Voting membership is severely restricted. In contrast to all other association football clubs in Germany, there is no official way to become a voting member of RasenballSport Leipzig e.V. According to Ulrich Wolter, the club does not aspire towards the high number of members of other clubs. Wolter has also pointed at other clubs, where <a href="Ultras">Ultras</a> have succeeded in creating structures, and stated that the club absolutely wants to avoid such conditions.
For the establishment of a registered voluntary association, an association is required by German law to have at least seven members. Four years after its founding, the club had only 9 members, all employees of Red Bull. By 2014 the registration fee for membership stood at 100 euros and the annual membership fee at 800 euros, in comparison to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> who, by that time, offered membership at annual fees between 30 and 60 euros. In addition to this, a person willing to pay the fee could not expect to become a member, since the management board could reject an application without notice.
This restrictive membership policy met criticism, thus one of the original requirements set up by the DFL in order to obtain a license for the 2014–15 2. Bundesliga season was to lower the membership fees and open up the association for new members. The club, in response to this pressure from the DFL, announced changes to the membership in June 2014. It then became possible for a person to become an "official supporting member". The annual fee for this type of membership is between 70 and 1000 euros and serves to promote junior football within the club. In return, a "supporting member" receives certain privileges, such as a meeting with the professional team and a fitness session at the Red Bull Arena. "Supporting members" also have the right to attend general meetings, "although without voting rights". In order to improve participation in the association, "supporting members" are represented by one member in the supervisory board.
GmbH.
On 2 December 2014, the general meeting of the association voted unanimously for the founding of a spin-off organization in the form of a <a href="GmbH">GmbH</a>. The decision was taken at an extraordinary meeting. Present were 14 voting members and 40 "supporting members". Chairman Oliver Mintzlaff stated that the change was made for the club to be able to step up professionally and to remain competitive. The "RasenballSport Leipzig GmbH" is responsible for the professional team, the reserve team and men's junior teams from U15 and above.
As of 2015, Red Bull GmbH is the main shareholder of RasenballSport Leipzig GmbH, holding 99 percent of the shares. The remaining one percent is held by the association. However, as required by the 50 + 1 rule, formal power lies with the association, which holds the majority of votes.
As of April 2016, the <a href="general%20manager">general manager</a> of RasenballSport Leipzig GmbH was Oliver Mintzlaff.
Sponsorship.
RB Leipzig's kits were first provided by German sportswear brand <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> from the club's founding. In 2014, the club switched to the American sportswear brand <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>, in an agreement that was expected to be in place until at least 2025. In October 2014, the club also entered into promotional agreements with <a href="Hugo%20Boss">Hugo Boss</a>, <a href="Porsche">Porsche</a> as youth sponsor, and <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> for stadium commercials. On 20 May 2016, RB Leipzig extended its contract with <a href="Ur-Krostitzer">Krostitzer Brauerei</a> to be its official beer partner until 2018.
Joint donation, with Dortmund, Bayern and Leverkusen.
In March 2020, RB Leipzig, Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, and Bayer Leverkusen, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019–20 season, collectively gave €20 million to Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>.

Overview.
Having finished as runners-up in their <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Bundesliga">debut season</a> in the German top flight, RB Leipzig gained entry to continental football for the first time, specifically the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2017–18 UEFA Champions League</a>. RB Leipzig is one of the first clubs to qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> so soon (eight years) after its creation. The campaign also saw Red Bull Salzburg qualify as <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Austrian%20Football%20Bundesliga">Austrian champions</a>; this raised the issue of a possible conflict of interest between the clubs due to the level of influence exerted by Red Bull over both teams and the close sporting relationship between them in various aspects. After examining the operational structures during June 2017, <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> declared themselves satisfied under their regulations that the two clubs (particularly Salzburg) were suitably independent from the Red Bull corporation, and sufficiently distinct from one another, for both be admitted to their competitions.
In the first season following that ruling, both reached the quarter-finals of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2017–18 UEFA Europa League</a> but did not play each other, with RB Leipzig eliminated by <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a>, who then also knocked out Salzburg in the semi-finals. However, in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">next edition</a> of the same competition, RB Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg were drawn together in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20group%20stage%23Group%20B">Group B</a> to meet competitively for the first time. Salzburg won both fixtures between the clubs (3–2 in Germany, 1–0 in Austria), and also won all their other matches to top the group, while Leipzig failed to progress after dropping further points against <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> and <a href="Rosenborg%20BK">Rosenborg</a>.

In 2005, Red Bull bought a club in <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>, Austria and re-named them <a href="FC%20Red%20Bull%20Salzburg">Red Bull Salzburg</a> (so named to circumvent local rules on corporate naming) with the aim of establishing a leading branded team in that country in a similar mould to its existing franchises in Salzburg and other locations. Over the next decade, Leipzig became the owners' main football project, and the close relationship between the teams was exemplified by the number of players moving between them (<a href="Georg%20Teigl">Georg Teigl</a>, <a href="Marcel%20Sabitzer">Marcel Sabitzer</a>, <a href="Yordy%20Reyna">Yordy Reyna</a>, and <a href="Stefan%20Ilsanker%20%28footballer%29">Stefan Ilsanker</a> all transferred from Salzburg to Leipzig) with some of the Austrian fans becoming increasingly annoyed at their best players being signed by the 'step-sibling' club in their mission to climb through the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">levels of German football</a>.

Criticism.
The establishment of RB Leipzig has led to much criticism in Germany, particularly regarding the involvement of Red Bull GmbH and its restrictive membership policy. This has been seen by German football fans as contrary to common practice in the country, where clubs have traditionally relied on voluntary registered associations, with sometimes a very large number of members, and where the 50 + 1 rule has ensured that club members have a formal controlling stake. RB Leipzig has received criticism relating to perceptions that it was founded as a <a href="marketing%20tool">marketing tool</a> and that it increased the commercialization of football in Germany. The club has been rejected as a "marketing club", a "commercial club" or a "plastic club". This criticism has been widespread, and includes people in the management and among coaches and supporters of other clubs.
Supporters of other Leipzig football clubs, such as <a href="1.%20FC%20Lokomotive%20Leipzig">1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig</a> and FC Sachsen Leipzig, protested against the creation of RB Leipzig. They feared a decline of traditional fan culture in Leipzig, and a commercialization of football in the region. After the partnership with <a href="SSV%20Markranst%C3%A4dt">SSV Markranstädt</a> became known, protests immediately appeared in Leipzig suburbs. <a href="Red%20Bull">Red Bull</a> advertising boards at the Stadion am Bad in <a href="Markranst%C3%A4dt">Markranstädt</a> were smeared with graffiti and a weed killer placed on the pitch to purposely ruin it. Protests in Leipzig were generally non-violent. Despite RB Leipzig playing its inaugural season in 2009–10 in the same league as FC Lokomotive Leipzig and FC Sachsen Leipzig, criticism from these clubs was moderate. FC Lokomotive Leipzig chairman Steffen Kubald, nevertheless, said that the match against RB Leipzig would for each team be the match of the season, and referred to RB Leipzig s the "<a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> of the Oberliga" (fifth tier of German football).
The German economist Dr. Tobias Kollman said in 2009 that he saw Red Bull GmbH as a company with clear economic goals for its projects. Consequently, he described RB Leipzig as a "marketing club" and said that it was the first of this kind in Germany. He described the activities of Red Bull GmbH in Leipzig as a "sports political earthquake" in Germany. <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke and <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> chairman Heribet Bruchhagen, speaking in 2013 of a "clash of culture", warned that clubs backed by major companies or financially strong patrons could pose a threat to the entire Bundesliga. They said that such clubs would set traditional clubs backwards, and warned that RB Leipzig would be responsible for pushing a traditional club out of the Bundesliga. Hans-Joachim Watzke, speaking in 2014, characterized RB Leipzig's activities and the way it behaved as "morally questionable", referring to its transfer policy in close cooperation with FC Red Bull Salzburg, using its signing of Marcel Sabitzer as an example. Hans-Joachim Watzke said he was not an opponent of RB Leipzig, that appreciated the idea of a Bundesliga club from Saxony, and that the club was welcome for as long as the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association (DFB)</a> ensured that RB Leipzig complied with the "democratic rules of football" and the club finances its own operations. A fiercer critic, <a href="Peter%20Neururer">Peter Neururer</a>, head coach of <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a>, said in 2014 that RB Leipzig "made him sick" and that he considered the club to be built on purely economical interests. He further stated that competing with RB Leipzig was not a fair deal, because the club could sign the players it wanted, and that such competition "had nothing to do with the sport that we love".
Supporter groups from across Germany have protested against RB Leipzig and Red Bull GmbH. Supporters of traditional clubs have seen RB Leipzig as a symbol of defeat for tradition and victory for money, and have rejected RB Leipzig as a "plastic club". They have protested against the commercialization of football, Red Bull GmbH's involvement and the allegedly undemocratic structures at RB Leipzig.
After RB Leipzig gained promotion to 2. Bundesliga in 2014, supporter groups from ten clubs in the 2. Bundesliga created a campaign against the club, called "Nein zu RB" ("No to RB"). Since then, numerous groups across Germany have joined the campaign. In March 2015, the campaign web page indicated a number of 182 supporter groups from 29 clubs.
RB Leipzig has also seen protests against it at away matches. During the away match against <a href="1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">1. FC Union Berlin</a> on 21 September 2014, the home supporters symbolically wore black plastic ponchos and were silent for the first 15 minutes of the match. A large banner displayed by home supporters said: "In Leipzig, the football culture is dying". Another banner displayed said: "Football needs workers' participation, loyalty, standing terraces, emotion, financial fair play, tradition, transparency, passion, history, independence". The producers of Union's matchday program devised a more humorous protest for RB Leipzig's August 2015 visit, replacing the page that would normally be dedicated to the visiting team with an article on the history of bull farming. At an away match against FC Erzgebirge Aue on 6 February 2015, the home supporters displayed banners which compared <a href="Dietrich%20Mateschitz">Dietrich Mateschitz</a> to <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, and supporters of RB Leipzig to blind <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi</a> followers. FC Erzgebirge Aue was later fined 35,000 euros by the DFB for the banners. At an away match against <a href="1.%20FC%20Heidenheim">1. FC Heidenheim</a> on 18 September 2015, the player bus was approached upon the arrival at the stadium by supporters of 1. FC Heidenheim who pelted the bus with hundreds of counterfeit dollar bills printed with a <a href="caricature">caricature</a> of Dietrich Mateschitz depicted with a large <a href="Aquiline%20nose">hooked nose</a> and the text "Scheiß Red Bull" ("Shitty Red Bull") and "In <a href="Capitalism">Capitalism</a> he trusts". The action later led to a police investigation, for a possibly dangerous interference with traffic safety and for the imprint.
During the home match against <a href="FC%20Hansa%20Rostock">FC Hansa Rostock</a> on 23 November 2013, the away supporters protested by being entirely absent for the first seven minutes of the match and then filled the guest block in large numbers. A similar protest was also carried out during the home match against 1. FC Union Berlin on 19 February 2016. Other supporter groups in Germany have refused entirely to travel to away matches at the Red Bull Arena.
On some occasions, protests have involved violence and threats. RB Leipzig had to cancel three friendly matches in July 2009 for security reasons. At its first league match, away against <a href="FC%20Carl%20Zeiss%20Jena">FC Carl Zeiss Jena II</a> on 8 August 2009, riots started when the police dissolved a blockade attempting to prevent the player bus from entering the stadium. The player bus was attacked with bottles, and the police had to use pepper spray to overcome them. The team was insulted, spat at and pelted with beer cups during the warm-up, and left the stadium with a police escort after the match. At an away match against <a href="Hallescher%20FC">Hallescher FC</a> on 19 July 2013, the player bus was again a target. Riots then started after the match, when home supporters tried to break through a security perimeter to approach away supporters. Firecrackers and other objects were thrown at the police, and four police officers were slightly injured in the turmoil. Before an away match against <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a> on 9 March 2015, several supporters of RB Leipzig received letters, indirectly threatening them with violence if supported the team in <a href="Karlsruhe">Karlsruhe</a>. The night before that game, local hooligans entered the player hotel's lobby in Karlsruhe.
Several football clubs, such as <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>, <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">TSV 1860 Munich</a>, 1. FC Union Berlin, FC Erzgebirge Aue, <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a>, <a href="Chemnitzer%20FC">Chemnitzer FC</a> and <a href="KSV%20Hessen%20Kassel">KSV Hessen Kassel</a>, have cancelled friendly matches against RB Leipzig, due to protests from their own supporters.
Critics among RB Leipzig's supporters include the supporter group Rasenballisten, which describes itself as uniting critical supporters. According to what the group members have stated, the identity of a club cannot solely rely on its main sponsor; the group has criticized Red Bull GmbH for dominating how the club is represented externally. The group prefers to place emphasis on the "RasenBallsport" part of the club's name, as well as the Leipzig identity.
Representatives of Red Bull GmbH and RB Leipzig have commented in response to criticism. Sporting director Ralf Rangnick referred to the presence of sponsors and investors at other clubs. He rhetorically asked what the difference was between <a href="Audi%20AG">Audi AG</a>'s and <a href="Adidas%20AG">Adidas AG</a>'s involvement at FC Bayern Munich, and the commitment of Red Bull GmbH at RB Leipzig. He admitted, though, that there "was" a difference: FC Bayern Munich first had sporting success, and then sponsors and investors showed their interest. However, he claimed that <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> and <a href="Bayer%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> were similar to RB Leipzig, and that VfL Wolfsburg became German champions in 2009 to a large extent due to the financial support from <a href="Volkswagen%20AG">Volkswagen AG</a>. Red Bull co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz said in 2009 that the sports commitment of Red Bull GmbH was "indeed" different from the sports commitments of other companies. According to the Red Bull co-founder, when the company is involed in sports, that company is directly involved in the sports operations. Red Bull co-founder Mateschitz also explained in 2007 that when the company is involved in sports, it is integrated and takes responsibility for the sports performance, and wants to build the identity of the brand and the sport. RB Leipzig club CEO Ulrich Wolter, speaking in 2013, charcaterized Dietrich Mateschitz as not an <a href="Russian%20oligarch">oligarch</a> or a <a href="Sheikh">Sheikh</a> who buys a toy club, but as a man interested in success with a long-term sustainable contribution to youth and professional football. RB Leipzig club CEO Ulrich Wolter, speaking in 2013 about the club's profile, said it was normal for a sponsor to want to make its brand known.
It has been suggested that the restrictive membership policy was implemented in order to prevent the club from being taken over by hostile supporters. RB Leipzig club CEO Ulrich Wolter, speaking in 2013 on his club's restrictive membership policy, said RB Leipzig prioritised its investors, ensuring the greatest possible legal certainty for them. He also said that conditions that had prevailed at some other clubs had been negative for development. Blogger Matthias Kiessling, who covered RB Leipzig continually from 2010 onwards, commented on RB Leipzig's restrictive membership policy in 2013, saying that the membership system of other clubs existed "pro forma", and that participation was then happening through other outlets, such as social media. RB Leipzig and club supporters have since the club's founding successively developed procedures to enable participation and dialogue. The club entered a cooperation agreement with the supporter organization "Fanprojekt Leipzig" in 2013, and the club also has a dialogue with the fan representatives of the supporter union "Fanverband RB Leipzig Fans".
Both Dietrich Mateschitz and sporting director Ralf Rangnick have made comments on transfer policy. Dietrich Mateschitz commented on the football commitment of Red Bull GmbH in 2007, and said that the company was "not good stars buyers". In an interview with Austrian sports website Sportnet in 2010 he said: "I am not <a href="Roman%20Abramovich">Abramovich</a>. What we do, we try to do with our brain. Nothing is easier than to take a bag full of money and go shopping. That is stupid, stupid we are not". In an interview with German newspaper "<a href="Leipziger%20Volkszeitung">Leipziger Volkszeitung</a>" in 2013 he further said: "It is not about a race, to arrive as soon as possible in the Bundesliga with as many mercenaries as possible, but about healthy development and healthy growth. And that with as many own players as possible". Sporting director Ralf Rangnick, speaking in 2013 on the club's transfer policy at that time, said that RB Leipzig was fishing in a very small pond, only signing players aged between 17 and 23 years old, and that RB Leipzig was the only club in the 2. Bundesliga that had not signed any players from another club in the league. Establishing a successful youth academy has also been part of the club's long-term strategy since its founding in 2009. Dietrich Mateschitz said in 2009 that his hopes were that the majority of the professional team would in the future have come through the ranks of the club's own academy. General manager Ulrich Wolter said in 2013 that the club wanted to build an "Eastern <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a>", so that young players from eastern Germany would not always have to migrate to the west of their country to develop. The youth work at RB Leipzig received much praise from the <a href="German%20Football%20League">German Football League (DFL)</a> in 2014.
Several people have responded to the rejection of RB Leipzig as a "plastic club", which lacks tradition. Sporting director Joachim Krug, speaking in 2009, characterized RB Leipzig as "a newly founded club" with high ambitions. Head coach Tino Vogel said that, at some point, <a href="Invented%20tradition">every new tradition begins</a>. Supporters of RB Leipzig were noted for displaying banners saying "Let this tradition begin" during the first competitive matches in 2009, and manager Dieter Gudel said in 2010 that RB Leipzig could well write "Tradition since 2009" on its pennants. Dietrich Mateschitz, speaking in 2013, characterized the only difference between RB Leipzig and FC Bayern Munich as one hundred years of tradition, and that in another five hundred years, RB Leipzig would be five hundred years of age and FC Bayern Munich six hundred years of age. By this, he meant that he expected that RB Leipzig would, some day, become a more traditional club than it is now.
Sporting director Ralf Rangnick spoke in 2012 of advantages to working in a new club without tradition. Rangnick said structural changes and staffing decisions could be implemented quickly and flexibly at RB Leipzig, because no established hierarchies would get in the way and there would be less resistance in the environment. Rangnick also stated that he "had seen enough examples of traditional clubs which have not made it anywhere". He said that to him, what mattered was if there existed a working philosophy and sustainability. The president of the DFB <a href="Wolfgang%20Niersbach">Wolfgang Niersbach</a>, speaking in 2014 with reference to clubs in Leipzig, said: "If the big traditional clubs have not managed to establish a serious way back in professional football for years and decades, then nobody should complain if a different approach is taken and this also leads to success".
RB Leipzig has received praise too, from businesspeople and politicians. Speaking in 2009, Michael Kölmel, an entrepreneur and owner of the Zentralstadion, said multinational company Red Bull GmbH was a huge opportunity for Leipzig. He also assumed that, in the end, other football clubs in Leipzig would benefit from RB Leipzig's creation. He based this on the assumption that young players would eventually stay in the area and, according to Kölmel, that the overall level of football in Leipzig would rise. Leipzig deputy mayor Heiko Rosenthal, speaking in 2010, said that RB Leipzig was the "best thing" that could happen to the economical development of Leipzig. He also believed the RB Leipzig project would bring attention to Leipzig, and that it would constitute an important component in the future economical representation of the city. Blogger Matthias Kiessling, who covered RB Leipzig continually from 2010 onwards, suggested in 2011, two years after Red Bull Leipzig had been founded, that Red Bull GmbH had given Saxony a more permanent investment than anything else since the fall of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>. Leipzig mayor <a href="Burkhard%20Jung">Burkhard Jung</a>, speaking in 2011, described Red Bull GmbH's involvement in Leipzig as an "incredible gift to the city". Dietrich Mateschitz was awarded the prize "Leipziger Lerche" in 2013 for his service to the region. Mayor Burkhard Jung described him as "honest, ambitious and serious". The prize ceremony was for the first time attended by the minister-president of Saxony, <a href="Stanislaw%20Tillich">Stanislaw Tillich</a>.
The chairman of the <a href="Saxony%20Football%20Association">Saxony Football Association (SFV)</a> Klaus Reichenbach said that he hoped Red Bull Leipzig's founding would lead to high class football, and that the region and eastern Germany might benefit. The chairman of the <a href="Northeastern%20German%20Football%20Association">Northeastern German Football Association (NOFV)</a> Rainer Milkoreit, speaking in 2014, characterized the promotion of RB Leipzig to the 2. Bundesliga as a great development for eastern Germany and that the attendance boom in Leipzig showed that Red Bull Leipzig had been awaited.
FC Bayern Munich president <a href="Uli%20Hoene%C3%9F">Uli Hoeneß</a>, speaking in 2011, said that the model chosen by RB Leipzig could be prosperous, "but not necessarily". He said that what Red Bull Leipzig was capable of offering its supporters would be decisive, and, that if the model should ultimately work, it would be beneficial for football in eastern Germany. Uli Hoeneß congratulated RB Leipzig to its promotion to the 2. Bundesliga in 2014 and said that it was the best thing that could happen to football in Leipzig. FC Bayern Munich sporting director <a href="Matthias%20Sammer">Matthias Sammer</a>, a native of <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, said in 2014 that he was positive to the development of RB Leipzig, and praised the positive economical effects it had for the region. He also rejected the complaints of "traditionalists", as 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BSG Chemie Leipzig ever since the <a href="Die%20Wende">Wende</a> have failed to join forces for the sake of local football. <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, speaking in 2015, predicted that RB Leipzig would be dangerous to FC Bayern Munich in 35 years, if Red Bull GmbH intends to invest for that long a time, and that RB Leipzig was a concept with a future.
VfL Wolfsburg manager <a href="Klaus%20Allofs">Klaus Allofs</a>, speaking in 2016, said that RB Leipzig was a cast of fortune for Leipzig, and a good thing for the region and for German football.
In interviews published in German newspaper "Bild" in 2011, representatives of several Leipzig football clubs spoke of ways they said their clubs had benefited from RB Leipzig's founding. Former FC Sachsen Leipzig liquidator Heiko Kratz said that, by 2009, the club was no longer able to finance its youth academy, but by selling its A to D junior teams to RB Leipzig, at least they could give the players a future. Then President of SSV Markranstädt Holger Nussbaum said the club had used Red Bull Leipzig's financial compensation to have players that it otherwise would not have, and that it was aiming to reach the Regionalliga. Ralph Zahn, then Head of department at ESV Delitzsch, said that the club had used Red Bull Leipzig's financial compensation to build an artificial turf pitch with floodlights for the cost of 250,000 euros.
According to a survey carried out by the "Leipziger Volkszeitung" in 2009, more than 70% of the residents of Leipzig welcomed Red Bull GmhH's investment in local football. The "Leipziger Volkszeitung" published results from a study carried out by Intelligence Research in Sponsorshop (Iris) in 2016. According to the study, RB Leipzig then ranked third favourite team in Saxony and Thuringia, only surpassed by FC Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. RB Leipzig also had an increase in five out of six image values: sympathetic had increased 2.8 percent to 45.1 percent, native had increased 7.2 percent to 40.5 percent, credible had increased 4.8 percent to 43.8 percent, regionally rooted remained at 45.8 percent, ambitious had increased 3.7 percent to 77.5 percent and passionate had increased 5.8 percent to 47 percent. A study carried out by the company Repucom in 2016 showed that RB Leipzig had a nationwide increase of 60 percent in press, radio and television coverage. It also showed that the reports had become more "objective and complex".

FC Energie Cottbus

FC Energie Cottbus (<a href="Lower%20Sorbian">Lower Sorbian</a>: "Energija Chóśebuz") is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German football club</a> based in <a href="Cottbus">Cottbus</a>, <a href="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>. It was founded in 1963 as SC Cottbus in what was <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>. After the <a href="German%20reunification">reunification of Germany</a>, Energie played six seasons in the third tier of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a> before floating between the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> and <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> for 17 years between 1997 and 2014. From 2014 to 2016, the club played in the third tier, <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>, and were then relegated to the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nordost">Regionalliga Nordost</a>. In 2018, they were promoted back into the 3. Liga, only to be relegated again the next season.
History.
Predecessor sides.
Energie Cottbus can trace its roots back to a predecessor side of <a href="FSV%20Gl%C3%BCckauf%20Brieske-Senftenberg">FSV Glückauf Brieske-Senftenberg</a>, a club founded by coal miners in 1919, in what was then called the town of Marga. FV Grube Marga, as the club was then called, was active until 1924 when the miners left to form a new team called SV Sturm Grube Marga, which was banned by the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> in 1933.
East German era.
The club re-emerged after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in 1949 as BSG Franz Mehring Grube, becoming <a href="Betriebssportgemeinschaft%20%28GDR%29">BSG</a> Aktivist Brieske-Ost in 1950. The club was re-organized as <a href="Sports%20club%20%28East%20Germany%29">sports club</a> SC Aktivist Brieske-Senftenberg in 1954 and played in the <a href="DDR-Oberliga">DDR-Oberliga</a> generally earning mid-table results until relegation to second-tier <a href="DDR-Liga">DDR-Liga</a> in the early 1960s. The players of this side joined the new sports club SC Energie Cottbus in 1963, whilst the reserve team merged back to BSG Aktivist Brieske-Ost to form BSG Aktivist Senftenberg. The club still exists as <a href="FSV%20Gl%C3%BCckauf%20Brieske-Senftenberg">FSV Glückauf Brieske-Senftenberg</a> today. SC Cottbus was quickly assisted by a wholesale transfer of players from <a href="FSV%20Gl%C3%BCckauf%20Brieske-Senftenberg">SC Aktivist Brieske-Ost</a> ordered by the East German authorities, who often intervened in the business of the country's sports and football clubs for political reasons. East German authorities had a penchant for tagging sports teams with the names of socialist heroes: <a href="Franz%20Mehring">Franz Mehring</a> was a German socialist politician and journalist.
In the mid-1960s, a re-organization program by the regime led to the separation of football sides from sports clubs and the creation of BSG von Bodo Krautz under the patronage of a local coal mine. The football club went by that name only briefly and was quickly renamed BSG Energie in early 1966.
German reunification.
The team took on the name FC Energie in 1990 at the time of <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>.
After years as a II division or lower-table I division side in East Germany, Energie emerged as one of the few former DDR sides to enjoy relative prosperity in a united Germany. After six seasons playing tier III football, the club earned <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation%23promoted">returned</a> to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in 1997 (the same year they became the first former East German club to play the <a href="1997%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">DFB Cup Final</a>), winning the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nordost">Regionalliga Nordost</a>, and then played its way into the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 2000, where it had a three-year stay. A key player in the Bundesliga run was <a href="Vasile%20Miriu%C8%9B%C4%83">Vasile Miriuță</a>, an imaginative midfield player. After being <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation%23relegated">returned</a>, Energie narrowly missed a prompt return to the top tier, losing out to <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">Mainz 05</a> on goal difference.
In <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%202.%20Bundesliga">2004–05</a>, Energie struggled with both financial (reported debts of €4.5 million) and on-field problems, and the only club escaped relegation to the third tier <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a> by scoring one more goal than <a href="SV%20Eintracht%20Trier%2005">Eintracht Trier</a> while having the same number of points and goal difference. During the season, the manager and the chairman were replaced. The <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%202.%20Bundesliga">2005–06</a> season was a much more successful one, as the club finished third and returned to the Bundesliga.
The <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07 Bundesliga</a> season resulted in a 13th-place finish and 41 points, a club record total in the Bundesliga. Energie Cottbus were the only club from the former East Germany playing in the Bundesliga until they lost a relegation play-off to <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> in 2009. Cottbus remained in the 2. Bundesliga for another five seasons until 2014, when an 18th-place finish meant <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation%23relegation">returning</a> to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>, ending a 17-season stint in the top two divisions. After a 19th-place finish in the 3. Liga in 2015–16, the club suffered another returned to the Regionalliga Nordost.
Following two seasons in the fourth tier, Cottbus returned to 3. Liga after defeating <a href="SC%20Weiche%20Flensburg%2008">Weiche Flensburg</a> over two legs in the Regionalliga play-offs, but in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%203.%20Liga">2018–19</a> season they were returned to the Regionalliga after finishing 17th.
On May 21, 2023, Cottbus won the Regionalliga Nordost with their win over <a href="SV%20Babelsberg%2003">SV Babelsberg 03</a> in Matchweek 33. It was their third time winning Regionalliga Nordost and their first since 2018. 
13 days later, on June 3, 2023, Cottbus won the <a href="Brandenburg%20Cup">Brandenburg Cup</a> for the 11th time in their history. They defeated <a href="FSV%2063%20Luckenwalde">FSV 63 Luckenwalde</a> by a score of 4–1.
Former German Chancellor <a href="Angela%20Merkel">Angela Merkel</a> is an honorary member of the club.
Honours.
The club's honours:
The all-foreign line-up.
On 6 April 2001, Energie became the first Bundesliga club to field a side made up of 11 foreign players. Energie often fielded nine or ten foreigners that season: German players appeared a total of just 83 times, with striker <a href="Sebastian%20Helbig">Sebastian Helbig</a> as the leader with 28.

As a side note, even the three substitutes were foreigners, namely <a href="Johnny%20R%C3%B6dlund">Johnny Rödlund</a> from Sweden, <a href="Sabin%20Ilie">Sabin Ilie</a> from Romania and <a href="Witold%20Wawrzyczek">Witold Wawrzyczek</a> from Poland <a href="http%3A//www.fussballdaten.de/bundesliga/2001/28/cottbus-wolfsburg/"></a>.
Reserve team.
The <a href="German%20reserve%20football%20teams">club's reserve team</a>, FC Energie Cottbus II, has played as high as <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a> level, last playing in the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nordost">Regionalliga Nordost</a> in 2012–13. The team most recently played in the tier five <a href="NOFV-Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd">NOFV-Oberliga Süd</a> but has, in the past, also played in the <a href="NOFV-Oberliga%20Nord">northern division</a> of the league. It first reached Oberliga level in 1998 and has won league championships in 2007 and 2010.

SSV Ulm 1846 FUSSBALL was formed on 9 March 2009 as new independent club through the separation of the football department from the present-day multi-sports club SSV Ulm 1846 e.V. The club currently play in <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> from 2023–24 after promotion from Regionalliga Südwest in 2022–23.
The club's greatest success has been promotion to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 1998–99, where it played for just one season. Ulm has also spent eight seasons in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> between 1979–80 and 2000–01.
History.
The older of the two predecessor sides was founded on 12 April 1846 as Turnerbund Ulm. They had an on-again, off-again relationship with Turnverein Ulm through the 1850s. The football department became independent in 1926 as Ulmer Rasensport Verein and in 1939 would merge with Ulmer Fußball Verein, and their old clubmates in TB Ulm and TV Ulm, to form TSG Ulm 1846. In 1968, RSVgg Ulm became part of TSG Ulm 1846.

The football department of Turnerbund Ulm became independent in 1926 as Ulmer Rasensportverein and in 1939 would merge with Ulmer Fußballverein, and their old club mates in TB Ulm and TV Ulm, to form TSG Ulm 1846. Throughout this time the club played in local competition before joining the <a href="Gauliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Gauliga Württemberg</a>, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the 1933 reorganisation of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>, for the 1939–40 season. The club played there until the end of World War II. After the war they began play in the <a href="2.%20Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd">2. Oberliga Süd</a> (II) and did well enough to make occasional advances to the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Süd</a> (I) for short stays before falling back again. In 1963, with the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new top-flight professional league, TSG Ulm 1846 found itself in the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963%E2%80%931974%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> (II) for a couple of seasons before slipping to tier III and IV level play. In 1968, RSVgg Ulm became part of TSG Ulm 1846.

After the war and leading up to their union with TSG 1846, they played as a third or fourth division side. Finally, in 1970, 1. SSV Ulm merged with TSG 1846 to form SSV Ulm 1846.

At the time of the merger. both clubs were playing football in the tier III <a href="Amateurliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Amateurliga Württemberg</a> and would continue to do so for a nearly a decade. In 1980, the combined side advanced to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281974%E2%80%9381%29">2. Bundesliga Süd</a> and would spend six of the next ten years playing at that level where, except for a fifth-place finish in 1982, their results were well down the table. After another decade in the level III Amateur <a href="Oberliga%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Oberliga Baden-Württemberg</a> and <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga Süd</a>, 1846 made an unexpected breakthrough after just one season in the 2. Bundesliga with a third-place finish that led to the club's promotion to the top-flight Bundesliga for the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Bundesliga">1999–2000</a> season. Even though the issue was not decided until the last day of the season, Ulm could do no better than a sixteenth-place finish and returned to the second division. The <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%202.%20Bundesliga">2000–01</a> season was an unqualified disaster for the club: they could manage only another sixteenth-place finish and were sent back down to the Regionalliga Süd (III). They were then denied a licence over the chaotic state of their finances which plunged the club down to the fifth tier <a href="Verbandsliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Verbandsliga Württemberg</a>. Afterwards Ulm worked their way back, to the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg (IV) in 2002, and the Regionalliga in 2008.

Following the <a href="2009%20European%20football%20betting%20scandal">2009 European football betting scandal</a>, the club released three allegedly involved players, <a href="Davor%20Kraljevi%C4%87">Davor Kraljević</a>, Marijo Marinović and Dinko Radojević. In January 2011, the club was declared insolvent, and the results of the 2010–11 season were declared void. The club was relegated to the <a href="Oberliga%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Oberliga Baden-Württemberg</a> but immediately won the 2011–12 title, finishing nine points clear of second-placed <a href="VfR%20Mannheim">VfR Mannheim</a> and earning promotion to the new <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga Südwest</a>.
In May 2014, SSV Ulm 1846 was once again close to insolvency, for the third time in 13 years, requiring €420,000 in financial support before the end of the month to ensure survival. The club eventually entered administration and was relegated back to the Oberliga. After two seasons, SSV Ulm 1846 was promoted to the Regionalliga in May 2016.
On 28 May 2023, SSV Ulm 1846 secured promotion to 3. Liga for the first time from 2023–24, after defeating <a href="SG%20Barockstadt%20Fulda-Lehnerz">Barockstadt Fulda-Lehnerz</a> 5–0 and becoming champion of the Regionalliga Südwest.

Borussia Mönchengladbach

Borussia Verein für Leibesübungen 1900 e.V. Mönchengladbach, commonly known as Borussia Mönchengladbach, or simply Borussia () is a professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Mönchengladbach</a>, <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>, Germany that plays in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, the top flight of <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German football</a>.

Borussia Mönchengladbach were founded in 1900, with their name derived from a Latinised form of <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, which was a popular name for German clubs in the former <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. The team joined the Bundesliga in 1965 and saw the majority of its success in the 1970s, where, under the guidance of <a href="Hennes%20Weisweiler">Hennes Weisweiler</a> and then <a href="Udo%20Lattek">Udo Lattek</a>, a young squad with a fast, aggressive playing style was formed. During this period, Mönchengladbach won the Bundesliga five times, the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> twice and reached a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> final in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20European%20Cup%23Final">1977</a>.

History.
1899–1905: formation.
In November 1899, a group of discontented members left their sports association, TC Germania Gladbach (referred to as "Teutonia Gladbach" in some sources). On 17 November 1899, thirteen of these young men formed a new club, this time specifically focused on association football, in the "Zum Jägerhof" pub. They chose the word "Borussia" (<a href="Latin">Latin</a>: "<a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>") as their association's new title, although this was not yet the club's official founding. "Borussia" was chosen because Mönchengladbach was located in the western provinces awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia as part of the 1815 <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>. Other notable football clubs in western Germany that chose the name "Prussia" as their title include <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> in 1909 and <a href="SC%20Preu%C3%9Fen%20M%C3%BCnster">SC Preußen Münster</a> in 1906.Borussia's early years were faced with the problems typical for association football teams in the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>: the sport, only recently imported from the <a href="United%20Kingdom">UK</a> in the 1880s, was not yet institutionally accepted, and as a result there were logistical shortages of football fields, goals, changing rooms, and player equipment. Borussia's players initially had to finance their own gear for what was at the time a considerable financial expenditure for working-class people.
Borussia was the second dedicated football club in the city of Mönchengladbach. FC Mönchengladbach, founded six years earlier in 1894, quickly became Borussia's first rival. Whereas FC Mönchengladbach was decently established, young Borussia found it difficult to guarantee regular access to training grounds and equipment. As a result, the team joined the "Marianische Jünglings-Kongregation Mönchengladbach Eicken" (German: "Marian Youth Congregation Mönchengladbach Eicken"), a fairly conservative Catholic sporting association. Within this larger organization, the footballers reformed into the "Fussball Club Borussia 1900" on 1 August 1900, marking the club's official founding date.
From within the congregation, Borussia was able to more effectively organize official games against various opposing teams. The team scored 2–1 victories over both Blitz Neuwerk and Germania Mönchengladbach, and a 4–2 victory over Rheydt FC. As early as 1902, Borussia crossed international borders for the first time, losing 0–2 against Helmondia Helmond in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, before playing the Dutch team to a 1–1 draw at home.
The appeal of both association football in general and Borussia in particular proved too socially scandalous for the conservative federation leadership to tolerate. The practice of football players wearing shorts instead of long trousers and the reality of football practice on Sundays hindering Church attendance created tension between Borussia and the Youth Congregation Eicken, and Borussia ultimately left the congregation on 24 May 1903.
To continue successful football competitions and to ease the organization of games, the club had applied to join the "Rheinisch-Westfälischer Spielverband" (German: "Rhenish-Westphalian Sports Federation") on 16 February 1903, and was accepted on 23 February. Borussia continued playing local and regional opponents like Britannia Düsseldorf and BV Solingen. They also continued to travel to the nearby Netherlands, drawing Eindhoven VV 1–1. Still, the team at times struggled against mightier opponents. Borussia received a 0–11 thrashing at the hands of Borussia Cologne in October 1903 in the away fixture, before somewhat improving the performance by losing 1–4 at home in the return game.
In 1904, Borussia competed with several other local teams in the third class of the second district of the Rhenish-Westphalian Sports Federation. After Borussia's only competitor for the title, BV Solingen, skipped the 1905 fixture in Mönchengladbach, Borussia won the title without having to face their opponent. On 8 January 1905, Borussia additionally scored a respectable 1–0 win over its city rival FC Mönchengladbach, albeit against the third team, confirming an earlier 6–1 win over FC Mönchengladbach on 26 December 1904. After having won the district cup, Borussia competed for the third class federation cup against, among others, teams from Essen and Cologne, ultimately losing the title to Kölner FC 99.
1905–1914: before the First World War.
After some decent athletic success in the year 1905 (18 games, 12 wins, 1 draw, 5 losses), Borussia nonetheless faced frustration, as the playing grounds were judged insufficient for competition play. The team was subsequently excluded from major competitions until a more appropriate locale could be found.
Ultimately, Borussia acquired a patch of land on "Reyerhütterstraße" in Mönchengladbach to enable organized play, at a time when the growing spread of football made it more and more of a hassle in terms of property damage and noise pollution. By achieving access to its own football grounds, Borussia thus evaded the growing number of police actions that were launched to call football enthusiasts to order. Regular play continued, after more than a year of absence, in the second class of the second district, against teams like FC Mönchengladbach II, FC Eintracht Mönchengladbach and various teams from Düsseldorf and Krefeld, among others. After a 2–0 against Rheydt and two victories over Düsseldorf teams (4–1 against Britannia Düsseldorf, 4–1 against Union Düsseldorf), the first home game was held in "Reyerhütterstraße" against Preußen Krefeld. Borussia won the game with two goals difference.
At the end of the competition, Borussia was district champion, with eight wins in eight games (although Borussia had lost a 0–2 game against FC Mönchengladbach II that was subsequently annulled when FC Mönchengladbach II was disqualified from the competition), with 25 goals scored and only 8 conceded. But Borussia was skipped for promotion regardless; the club was once again assigned to the second class (now called "B-Klasse") as a result of a league reform.
In 1907, Borussia left "Reyerhütterstraße", where a new factory was under construction, and reached a deal with Gladbacher Turnverein 1848 to cooperatively run a ground near the "Schweizerhaus", a famous gastronomy in the vicinity of the "<a href="Kaiser-Friedrich-Halle">Kaiser-Friedrich-Halle</a>" []. Games at the new grounds go well, with a 5–1 win over Borussia Köln, which had inflicted a painful 0–11 loss on Borussia in 1903, as well as a 5–3 against Rheydt. The season as a whole was mediocre for Borussia, ending with five wins, four losses and a draw at 19 goals scored and 13 conceded in third place. Borussia qualified for a promotion tournament to determine the team to be promoted to A class, but lost 0–6 to Viktoria Mönchengladbach.
The 1908–09 season was better for Borussia. After a 0–2 loss at home against FC Eintracht Mönchengladbach, Borussia regained its footing, beating Viktoria Mönchengladbach 4–1 in an away game and drawing them 2–2 at home. On 13 January 1909, Borussia scored an overwhelming 13–1 victory over Spiel und Sport Essen. Losing no game but the opener against Eintracht, Gladbach easily came first in the league, thus qualifying from Group South to face the promotion candidates from Group North, "FC Cleve 06". After a resounding 5–1 win at home, the enthusiasm was dampened by a 3–4 setback in the away fixture. In the tiebreaker game, Borussia won 4–1, at last gaining promotion to the first division.
Going into the 1909–10 season, Borussia exchanged its previous black and white colour scheme with blue and yellow vertical stripes. Gladbach started into the higher league with significant issues, bringing Rheydt SpV only to a 2–2 at home before struggling with a crushing defeat in the 0–9 away fixture. The team ended the season with five wins, five losses and two draws in fourth place, avoiding relegation. The club's tenth anniversary had seen a record 143 registered members, up from 32 in 1906 and 75 in 1908.
In the 1910–11 season, the league grew from seven to ten teams, adding opponents like Germania Hilden, FC Krefeld and Eintracht Mönchengladbach, bringing the game plan for Borussia to 18 games, not counting numerous friendly matches that brought the total number of games played to over 30, placing a significant strain on the amateur players. Aside from a noteworthy 11–2 victory over rivals Rheydt SV, the season was another mediocre performance for Borussia. The season forced Borussia to once again move the playing ground, after the "Schweizerhaus" grounds were deemed to dangerous in response to complaints by opposing teams. Borussia subsequently moved to grounds near the Catholic graveyard, and finished fourth in the league. The new grounds were known as "Stadion am Rosengarten".
The 1911–12 season was the first major success in the club's history. Borussia easily dominated the league with twelve wins, one draw and one loss, and thus earned qualification for promotion games towards "Verbandsliga" as northern district champions as well as the West German championship. Borussia defeated VfJuB Düren, the southern district champions, in a 4–2 game, before achieving a 5–0 blowout against <a href="VfB%20Gie%C3%9Fen">VfB 1900 Gießen</a>, the <a href="Hesse">Hessian</a> champions. Ultimately, Borussia lost the finals for the West German championship against Cologne BC 01, the precursor of Borussia's greatest all-time rival, <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>, at a 2–4 scoreline.
In a step down from the previous season's outstanding performance, Borussia proved to struggle in the 1912–13 season. While the team was not threatened by relegation at any point in the tournament, Borussia ended in the middle of the table without a serious claim towards the title, and was no serious threat in the West German championship either. Borussia ended the season in sixth place in the league, at eight wins, two draws and eight losses.
In the last full season before the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, the German footballing structure was again reformed in the 1913–14 season. The system of two federation leagues (German: "Verbandsliga") of twenty clubs each was replaced with a system of four district leagues (German: "Kreisliga") of ten clubs each. This left Borussia in the Rhenish Northern District (German: "Rheinischer Nordkreis") along with teams from Aachen and Düsseldorf, as well as other teams from Mönchengladbach. In the preparation for the season, Borussia performed miserably, losing 1–3 to Viktoria Duisburg and 1–6 to Duisburg SV. Borussia, nonetheless, entered the season with a clear goal to earn the district championship. The team fell well short of that target, coming third in the league at five wins, five draws and four losses. The highlight of the season wass a friendly match against an English professional team. <a href="Dulwich%20Hamlet%20F.C.">Dulwich Hamlet</a>, which Borussia's amateur footballers lost 2–5 (initially having led 2–1 by the 80th minute before conceding four goals in the last ten minutes).
1914–1918: First World War.
In March 1914, the club purchased "De Kull", a decommissioned gravel pit and the grounds on which the later <a href="B%C3%B6kelbergstadion">Bökelbergstadion</a> would be built. The <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> halted the progress of both the stadium and football in general, as many players volunteered or were drafted for military service. With rapidly changing player lineups, Borussia contested the war cup (German: "Kriegspokal"), beating Düren 7–0. In total, Borussia played 18 games in the 1914–15 season, in spite of the logistical difficulties caused by the war.
In time for the 1915–16 season, it had become clear that the war, initially anticipated by all sides to conclude quickly, would last longer than expected. Regardless, Borussia was able to assemble a functional team for the season (reinforced regularly by players on vacation from frontline duty), and played games against Union Krefeld, Viktoria Rheydt, Konstantia Kaldenkirchen, VfB Krefeld, FC Mönchengladbach and Eintracht Mönchengladbach. After a shaky start, including a 1–4 friendly game loss to Borussia Düsseldorf, Borussia found its footing in the league, and briefly rivalled Krefeld for the first place in January 1916. Ultimately, Borussia finished second in the league. By mid-1916, Borussia was forced to cease regular play due to the lack of regularly available players. By 4 November 1916, even the provisional club leadership had to cease operations, as too many of its members were called up for military service.
Borussia suffered several losses due to war casualties: The club's chairman since 1912, Heinz Körstgens, was killed in action in 1915, as was Stephan Ditgens, Borussia player and uncle of Borussia's first ever Germany national team player, <a href="Heinz%20Ditgens">Heinz Ditgens</a>.
1918–1933: during the Weimar Republic.
In the immediate aftermath of the military armistice of 11 November 1918, football clubs all over Germany began to gradually resume operations. Members of Borussia had informal meetings about the resumption of play even during the last months of the war, as early as mid-1918. The first recorded game of this phase was a 5–0 over Rheydt SV on 15 August 1918, followed by the turnaround in the form of a 2–7 thrashing at the hands of Rheydt SV in the return fixture a week later. The aftermath of the war interrupted the blossoming football of 1918–19, as only seven of Borussia's 14 planned games were held due to the occupation of the region by the <a href="Belgian%20Armed%20Forces">Belgian Armed Forces</a>.
The decades-long struggle to find a usable locale to play continued, as "De Kull" was not yet ready to be used. By early 1919, the team returned to "Schweizerhaus" as a temporary measure. On 15 March 1919, FC Borussia merged with another local club, Turnverein Germania 1889, becoming 1889 VfTuR M.Gladbach. The club achieved its first major success in 1920, defeating Kölner BC 3–1 to win the 1920–1921 West German championship final.
The union between Germania and Borussia only lasted a matter of two years; the club was thereafter known as Borussia VfL 1900 e.V. M.Gladbach.
1933–1945: football under the Third Reich.
Following the rise of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> to power in 1933, the German league system was reformed to consist of 16 Gauligen – Gladbach found themselves playing first in the "Gauliga Niederrhein", and later in various "Bezirksklassen" (district leagues). Also while under the Third Reich, Mönchengladbach's first ever international player was capped; <a href="Heinz%20Ditgens">Heinz Ditgens</a> playing in a 9–0 win over <a href="Luxembourg%20national%20football%20team">Luxembourg</a> for <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a> in the <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Olympic Games</a>.
1945–1959: rebuild after War.
Eventually, Mönchengladbach resumed play in June 1946, gaining successive promotions to the Landesliga Niederrhein (the regional second tier) in 1949 and the top flight, the Oberliga West, in 1950. Following many years of promotions and relegations, Borussia won their first "Oberliga" title in the 1958–59 season.
1959–1965: promotion to the Bundesliga.
In August 1960, Borussia Mönchengladbach defeated <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> in the West German Cup. Weeks later, the club won the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20DFB-Pokal%23Final">DFB-Pokal</a>, a first national honour, after defeating <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a> 3–2 in the final. Borussia therefore qualified for the <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1960–61</a>, where they were defeated 11–0 on aggregate by the Scottish club, <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>. Rangers won 3–0 in Germany and 8–0 in Glasgow.
The following year, the club took on the now-familiar name Borussia VfL Mönchengladbach after the city of München-Gladbach became Mönchengladbach.
The 1961–62 season in the Oberliga ended again with Borussia in 13th place in the table. In 1962–63, the club hoped in vain to join the circle of DFB clubs which would start the following year in the newly founded Bundesliga. <a href="Helmut%20Beyer">Helmut Beyer</a>, who remained in office for 30 years, took over the responsibility of president that season and <a href="Helmut%20Grashoff">Helmut Grashoff</a> took over as second chairman. In July 1962, Borussia signed <a href="Fritz%20Langner">Fritz Langner</a>, who had won the West German championship in 1959 with <a href="Westfalia%20Herne">Westfalia Herne</a>, as their new coach. To Langner's chagrin, the new leadership sold <a href="Albert%20Br%C3%BCllsfor">Albert Brüllsfor</a> a record fee of 250,000 DM to <a href="FC%20Modena">FC Modena</a> in Italy in order to rehabilitate the club financially. Helmut Grashoff, who collected the fee in Italian lira in cash in a suitcase, later said he had feared, after the money transfer, "being thought a bank robber". The proceeds from the transfer enabled Langner to rebuild the squad with the signing of players like <a href="Heinz%20Lowin">Heinz Lowin</a>, <a href="Heinz%20Crawatzo">Heinz Crawatzo</a> and <a href="Siegfried%20Burkhardt">Siegfried Burkhardt</a>. That year, the A-Youth team won the West German championship with a squad that included future professional footballers, <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Laumen">Herbert Laumen</a>.
Further honours would have to wait a decade. Borussia's results in the ten years leading up to the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Bundesliga">1963</a> were not strong enough to earn them admission into the ranks of the nation's new top flight professional league, and so the club played in the second tier, the <a href="Regionalliga%20West%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga West</a>.
In the next season, 1964–65, the club signed the youngsters, Jupp Heynckes and <a href="Bernd%20Rupp">Bernd Rupp</a>, and some of the youth team joined the professional squad. Their average age of 21.5 years was the lowest of all regional league teams. They earned the nickname "foals" due to their low average age as well as their carefree and successful play. Reporter Wilhelm August Hurtmanns coined the nickname in his articles in the "Rheinische Post". He was taken with the style of Borussia and wrote that they would play like young foals. By April 1965, the team had won the Regionalliga West and thus secured the participation in the Bundesliga promotion round in Group 1. This saw the team play against the competitors of Wormatia Worms (Second in the Regionalliga Südwest), SSV Reutlingen (Second in the Regionalliga Süd) and Holstein Kiel (Champions in the Regionalliga Nord) in first and second matches. Of the six games Borussia won three (5–1 in Worms, 1–0 against Kiel and 7–0 against Reutlingen). The achievement of the first place made promotion to the Bundesliga safe. Together with Borussia Bayern Munich rose by winning Group 2.
Mönchengladbach enjoyed its first taste of the Bundesliga in the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Bundesliga">1965–66 season</a>, earning promotion alongside future powerhouse <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. The two clubs went on to engage in a fierce struggle, as they challenged each other for domestic supremacy throughout the 1970s. Bayern took first blood in the struggle for supremacy between the two: winning the Bundesliga championship in <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Bundesliga">1969</a>. Mönchengladbach struck back immediately in the next season with a championship of their own and followed up with a second title in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Bundesliga">1971</a>, becoming the first Bundesliga club ever to successfully defend their title.
1965–1969: early years in Bundesliga and struggles.
The commitment of Weisweiler as coach pointed the way for the sporting success of the club in the Bundesliga. The economic situation of the club did not allow to finance a team of stars. Weisweiler corresponded to the needs of the association with his attitude to promote the education and development of young talents. He pressed Players not in a fixed game system, but promoted individualism and gave them considerable freedom on the field. This resulted in a carefree and offensive style of playing, the hallmark of "Fohlenelf".
The club signed with <a href="Berti%20Vogts">Berti Vogts</a> and <a href="Heinz%20Wittmann">Heinz Wittmann</a>, both players whose names should be closely linked to the sporting successes of Borussia.
The first Bundesliga match in the 1965–66 season took place away against <a href="Borussia%20Neunkirchen">Borussia Neunkirchen</a> and ended 1–1, the first Bundesliga goal scorer was <a href="Gerhard%20Elfert">Gerhard Elfert</a>. The first home game against <a href="SC%20Tasmania%201900%20Berlin">SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin</a> Borussia won 5–0. Weisweiler knew how to give the team tactical freedom and to promote the individual enthusiasm of the players. These freedoms cost the still immature team in the first Bundesliga season with a number of sometimes high defeats. The Borussia finished the first season in the Bundesliga on the 13th place in the table.
In the following season 1966–67 showed the scoring power of the Mönchengladbacher team, which scored 70 goals. The striker <a href="Herbert%20Laumen">Herbert Laumen</a> scored 18, <a href="Bernd%20Rupp">Bernd Rupp</a> 16 and <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> scored 14 goals. Due to the good goal difference, the team was able to complete the season on the eighth place in the table. With an 11–0 home win over <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">FC Schalke 04</a> on Matchday 18, the team celebrated the first highest ever victory in Bundesliga history.
The successes had the side effect that the salaries of the players jumped up and thus good players were not easy to hold onto. <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> moved for the former record transfer fee of 275,000 DM to <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a>, <a href="Bernd%20Rupp">Bernd Rupp</a> moved to <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">SV Werder Bremen</a>, and <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a> signed <a href="Gerhard%20Elfert">Gerhard Elfert</a>. The club bought <a href="Peter%20Meyer%20%28footballer%29">Peter Meyer</a> and <a href="Peter%20Dietrich">Peter Dietrich</a> and thus compensated for the departure of seasoned players. With a 10–0 win on the twelfth match-day of the season 1967–68 over <a href="Borussia%20Neunkirchen">Borussia Neunkirchen</a>, the team showed again their scoring power. The team reached in this and the next season third place in the table. The club signed in the season 1968–69 their future coach <a href="Horst%20K%C3%B6ppel">Horst Köppel</a>, who had already had first experiences in the national team, and from hitherto unknown amateur <a href="VfL%20Schwerte">VfL Schwerte</a> the then long-time goalkeeper <a href="Wolfgang%20Kleff">Wolfgang Kleff</a> and <a href="Hartwig%20Bleidick">Hartwig Bleidick</a>, <a href="Gerd%20Zimmermann%20%28footballer%29">Gerd Zimmermann</a> and <a href="Winfried%20Sch%C3%A4fer">Winfried Schäfer</a>, who played ten seasons at Borussia.
1970–1980: golden decade: dominance in the league and successes in Europe.
The 1970s went down as the most successful in the club's history. 
Under coach <a href="Hennes%20Weisweiler">Hennes Weisweiler</a>, the young side displayed an offensive-minded philosophy and powerful play that attracted fans from all over Germany.
Borussia won the championship five times, more than any other team in this time. At the same time a rivalry developed with FC Bayern Munich, with which Borussia together ascended in 1965 to the Bundesliga.
After the club had twice finished third in previous years, <a href="Hennes%20Weisweiler">Hennes Weisweiler</a> in the 1969–70 season coached especially the defence. Deviating from the "foal" concept, Borussia bought for the first time experienced defensive players like <a href="Luggi%20M%C3%BCller">Luggi Müller</a> and <a href="Klaus-Dieter%20Sieloff">Klaus-Dieter Sieloff</a>. With <a href="Ulrik%20le%20Fevre">Ulrik le Fevre</a> the club signed their first Danish player, later followed by <a href="Henning%20Jensen">Henning Jensen</a> and <a href="Allan%20Simonsen">Allan Simonsen</a>. This season saw the first Bundesliga victory over Bayern. After a 5–1 win over <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Alemannia Aachen</a> on 31 October 1969, Borussia topped the Bundesliga for the first time. Today (as of December 2018) Borussia takes third place in the list of league leaders in the Bundesliga behind Bayern and Dortmund.
On 30 April 1970, with a home win against <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> in the 33rd Round of the season, Borussia were named as champions.
On 16 September 1970, Herbert Laumen scored the first goal for Borussia in European club football in the 6–0 win against <a href="EPA%20Larnaca%20FC">EPA Larnaca</a>. The first round of the following season 1970–71 saw only one defeat for the club. In the history of the Bundesliga unique is an incident in the home game of the 27th matchday against <a href="Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>, known as the "post break from Bökelberg". In the game on 3 April 1971, after a penalty area scene in the 88th minute, the striker Herbert Laumen overturned the left goal post after a head clash with the Bremen goalkeeper <a href="G%C3%BCnter%20Bernardinto">Günter Bernardinto</a>. After unsuccessful attempts of repair, as no replacement goal could be set up, the referee stopped the game at the score of 1–1. The DFB sports court in Frankfurt rated the game as a 2–0 win for Bremen. As a consequence, the DFB obliged the clubs to provide a replacement for both goals. The championship was decided only on the last match day as a head-to-head race with Bayern Munich. Nine weeks after the post-break game, on 5 June 1971, Borussia were the first side in the history of the Bundesliga to defend their championship title, with a victory at <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>.
On 20 October 1971, in the <a href="European%20Cup">European Cup</a>, the champions took part in a "can-throwing game" in football history match against <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> instead. Borussia won the match at Bökelbergstadion 7–1, but <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> cancelled the game, as the Italian striker <a href="Roberto%20Boninsegna">Roberto Boninsegna</a> was hit by an empty coke can and received medical treatment. Coaching legend <a href="Matt%20Busby">Matt Busby</a> described the game of the colts:
After a 4–2 away defeat in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and a goalless draw in the replay at the <a href="Berlin%20Olympic%20Stadium">Berlin Olympic Stadium</a>, Borussia were eliminated from the Cup of the national champions.
"Die Fohlen" were able to take some consolation in a 2–1 victory over <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> in the <a href="Rheinland%20derby">Rheinland derby</a> by a goal by <a href="G%C3%BCnter%20Netzer">Günter Netzer</a> in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20DFB-Pokal%23Final">1973</a> to win their second <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. For Netzer this was the last game for Borussia: he left the club and moved to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>.
In addition to the game-winning scene in the 93rd minute from Netzer, there were numerous other highlights in the 30th cup final in history, "that of the one best, playful highly interesting and exciting in the history of this competition in the annals entered and of which one could swarm only in highest tones" ( Kicker ).
The first international final match took place on 9 May 1973. <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> won the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> first-leg 3–0 on the second try after the game was cancelled the day before due to rain. On 23 May 1973, Borussia Mönchengladbach won the second-leg 2–0, but Liverpool won the cup by aggregate victory.
The following seasons were marked by the departure of well-known players, although the main Mönchengladbach striker remained. In the 1973–74 season, Jupp Heynckes's 30 goals made him the top-scorer in the Bundesliga, the first Borussia Monchengladbach player to be so. In that first season following the departure of Günter Netzer, Borussia finished as runner-up to champions Bayern Munich by one point. With a total of 93 goals scored Borussia set a new club record. Borussia graduated in the following years 1972 to 1974, the championship in third and fifth place and vice-champion.
In the 1974–75 season, Borussia laid the foundation for a feat previously unheard of in the Bundesliga. On Matchday 17, the "foals" topped the league table and did not relinquish the league lead until winning the championship on 14 June 1975. The joy over the title was clouded by the departure of coach <a href="Hennes%20Weisweiler">Hennes Weisweiler</a>, who left the club after eleven years in the direction of <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>. The next international final with Mönchengladbach participation took place on 7 May 1975. The first leg of the UEFA Cup in Düsseldorf between Borussia and <a href="Twente%20Enschede">Twente Enschede</a> ended goalless. The second leg on 21 May 1975 was won by the VfL 5: 1. With the highest away win in a UEFA Cup final, Borussia won their first international title.
<a href="Udo%20Lattek">Udo Lattek</a>, who came from the rival <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, although he had already signed with <a href="Rot-Weiss%20Essen">Rot-Weiss Essen</a>, took over the club in the 1975–76 season. In contrast to the departed Weisweiler, Lattek represented a rather safety-first philosophy. The team topped the Championship on the twelfth round of the season, with a victory over <a href="Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> and <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a>, and retained that lead to the end of the season.
On 3 March 1976, on <a href="Ash%20Wednesday">Ash Wednesday</a>, was the next sensational international appearance of Borussia. In the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Champions Cup</a>, Borussia Mönchengladbach played against Real Madrid, where now <a href="G%C3%BCnter%20Netzer">Günter Netzer</a> and <a href="Paul%20Breitner">Paul Breitner</a> were under contract, 2:2. In the second leg (17 March 1976), which ended 1–1, the referee <a href="Leonardus%20van%20der%20Kroft">Leonardus van der Kroft</a> did not recognise two Mönchengladbach goals, in the 68th minute a goal by <a href="Henning%20Jensen">Henning Jensen</a> and in the 83rd minute by <a href="Hans-J%C3%BCrgen%20Wittkamp">Hans-Jürgen Wittkamp</a>. Once a foul must have preceded the goal, once the referee decided on offside, although it had been not indicated by the linesman. The draw was enough for the Madrilenians to progress.
The team stayed on the attack, and matched Bayern's achievement, with three consecutive titles from <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Bundesliga">1975</a> to <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Bundesliga">1977</a>. On 12 June 1976, Mönchengladbach won a fourth league title.
In the 1976–77 season, Lattek went with an almost unchanged team at the start. As <a href="Wolfgang%20Kleff">Wolfgang Kleff</a> was injured, the club signed a new goalkeeper. In <a href="Wolfgang%20Kneib">Wolfgang Kneib</a>, who came from <a href="SV%20Wiesbaden">SV Wiesbaden</a>, Lattek found a safe substitute. Borussia needed one point to defend the title on the final day. The match took place away against Bayern Munich, then sixth in the table, and ended 2:2 by an own goal in the 90th minute by <a href="Hans-J%C3%BCrgen%20Wittkamp">Hans-Jürgen Wittkamp</a>. Borussia made the hat-trick and won on 21 May 1977 for the third time in a row and for the fifth time overall the German championship title. The Dane <a href="Allan%20Simonsen">Allan Simonsen</a> received after this season the award as Europe's Footballer of the Year with the <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or">Ballon d'Or</a>.
The team narrowly missed a fourth championship title in a row in season 1977–78: Monchengladbach lost out to 1. FC Köln only by a worse goal difference. <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach%2012%E2%80%930%20Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia won against Borussia Dortmund 12–0 on the final day of the season</a>, still the highest victory in the history of the Bundesliga. However, the Domstädter won their last game 5:0 at FC St. Pauli: they had a better goal difference by three goals and so won the championship. For the first time in the Bundesliga first and second were tied after the end of the season. Borussia would have been able to decide the championship in their favour had they won the match against 1. FC Cologne a few weeks earlier. However, the game ended in a draw, with Cologne player Heinz Flohe netting a vital 83rd-minute equaliser.
Although Mönchengladbach lost the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20European%20Cup%23Final">1977</a> final of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> (25 May 1977), they also made four appearances in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, with wins in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20UEFA%20Cup%23Final">1975</a> and <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20UEFA%20Cup%23Final">1979</a> against losses in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20UEFA%20Cup%23Final">1973</a> and <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20UEFA%20Cup%23Final">1980</a>. The club's spectacular run had come to an end with eight trophies to their credit, and although they would continue to be competitive for many years, success would be much harder to come by.
In the following season 1978–79 <a href="Udo%20Lattek">Udo Lattek</a> managed Borussia for the last time. Many regulars left the club, such as the later vice-president Rainer Bonhof, or announced their career end, such as <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> and <a href="Berti%20Vogts">Berti Vogts</a>. Lattek did not succeed in offsetting these departures with appropriate new signings. On Matchday 30, the team was in 15th place with a goal-difference of 38:47 goals: three wins from the last four games improved the finish to tenth place. It was the first season in a long time in which the club finished with a negative goal-difference. Borussia signed Jupp Heynckes to be assistant coach to Lattek this season. The second international title started on 9 May 1979. The first leg in the UEFA Cup against <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> ended in a draw. In the second leg on 23 May 1979 Borussia won 1–0 at home to win the UEFA Cup for the second time.
After the departure of Lattek in the 1979–80 season, the club appointed <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> head coach. The season was marked by two new entries. The club signed <a href="Harald%20Nickel">Harald Nickel</a> of <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a>. With a transfer fee of 1.15 million DM this was the hitherto most expensive new purchase. From Herzogenaurach came <a href="Lothar%20Matth%C3%A4us">Lothar Matthäus</a>. Borussia finished the season in seventh place. On 7 May 1980, Borussia Mönchengladbach was again in a final for the UEFA Cup. At home, the team won against <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> 3–2. In the second leg on 21 May 1980, Eintracht Frankfurt won 1–0 against Borussia Mönchengladbach and secured the trophy due to the larger number of away goals scored.
1980–1996: slow down.
In the 1980s, Borussia could no longer build on the titles of the past decade and fell behind of the former rival from Munich. Due to the lack of ticket revenue from the small <a href="B%C3%B6kelbergstadion">Bökelbergstadion</a> the club had to sell top performers again and again. Nevertheless, it was possible to settle frequently in the upper third of the Bundesliga and play in the championship fight. In the 1980–81 season many longtime players and performers left the club, including <a href="Karl%20Del%27Haye">Karl Del'Haye</a> who is considered the first player who was signed by <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">FC Bayern Munich</a> in hostile intent. Borussia committed with Wolfram Wuttke only to striking players. They replaced <a href="Wolfgang%20Kleff">Wolfgang Kleff</a> in goal to <a href="Uli%20Sude">Uli Sude</a>. The team reached this season's sixth place in the table. The sporting record did not improve in the following two seasons. With a seventh place in 1982, Borussia missed participation in the international competitions. The following year, <a href="Uwe%20Kamps">Uwe Kamps</a> guarded the goal for the first time, and remained long-time goalkeeper for many years.
In the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Bundesliga">1983–84 season</a>, Borussia played for the title. With <a href="Bernd%20Krauss">Bernd Krauss</a>, <a href="Michael%20Frontzeck">Michael Frontzeck</a> and <a href="Uli%20Borowka">Uli Borowka</a>, Borussia committed players who played for a long time successfully for the club. At the end they landed tied behind VfB Stuttgart and Hamburger SV in third place. It was the first time in the history of the Bundesliga that three clubs tied the table on the last matchday. In the same season, Mönchengladbach also lost the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20DFB-Pokal%23Final">DFB-Pokal</a> final to Bayern Munich on penalties, <a href="Lothar%20Matth%C3%A4us">Lothar Matthäus</a> and <a href="Norbert%20Ringels">Norbert Ringels</a> both missing from the spot after the game originally ended all square at 1–1. Matthäus subsequently joined Bayern Munich for a then-record fee of 2.25 million <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">DM</a>, leading some fans to question whether he had deliberately missed his penalty.
In the 1984–85 season Borussia won 10–0 on Matchday 8 against <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a>, which is so far the last two-digit victory in Bundesliga history. In the semi-finals of the <a href="German%20Cup">German Cup</a> VfL met again at <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. After no goals had been scored in the regular season in <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Munich%29">Munich's Olympiastadion</a>, <a href="S%C3%B8ren%20Lerby">Søren Lerby</a> converted a penalty kick against Borussia goalkeeper <a href="Ulrich%20Sude">Ulrich Sude</a> in the 101st minute. This remained the only goal of the evening, so that Borussia missed the entry into the final.
The season 1985–86 brought no sporting highlights in the Bundesliga, with the club finishing fourth. Borussia Mönchengladbach gave away a 5–1 win over Real Madrid on 27 November 1985 in <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a> (11 December 1985), when the club lost 4–0 in Madrid and dropped out of the UEFA Cup.
In the 1986–87 season was again a coach change. <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> announced his move to <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. The club nominated <a href="Wolf%20Werner">Wolf Werner</a> as the new coach. At the end of the season, Borussia stood with the third place in the table for the last time in this decade at a <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> place. The <a href="Association%20of%20German%20Sports%20Journalists">Association of German Sports Journalists</a> voted <a href="Uwe%20Rahn">Uwe Rahn</a> "Player of the Year". Again Borussia reached the semi-finals of the DFB Cup. But also this time Borussia lost against the later DFB Cup winner <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>. On 22 April 1987, Borussia lost against the Scottish representative <a href="Dundee%20United%20F.C.">Dundee United</a> after defeat at home in <a href="B%C3%B6kelberg">Bökelberg</a> in the UEFA Cup semi-final. It was also the first defeat in a <a href="European%20Cup">European Cup</a> game on the Bökelberg. After the departure of <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a>, the era of long-standing engagements of head coaches ended. In the first 23 years from 1964 to 1987, Borussia only had three instructors; Since the departure of Heynckes, Borussia had committed 16 new coaches until 2008, with the exception of interim solutions. It was Werner's release on 21 November 1989 that saw first premature dismissal of a coach at Borussia at all. Only three later coaches managed to succeed in Mönchengladbach for more than three years, <a href="Bernd%20Krauss">Bernd Krauss</a> (1992–1996), <a href="Hans%20Meyer%20%28footballer%29">Hans Meyer</a> (1999–2003) and <a href="Lucien%20Favre">Lucien Favre</a> (2011–2015).
In the next season, Borussia signed <a href="Stefan%20Effenberg">Stefan Effenberg</a>, a player who worked long and successfully for the club. Borussia finished the season in seventh place and thus missed the participation in international competitions. The early 1990s followed a significant downward trend. As a result of the sporting decline, the number of spectators at the Bökelberg was declining for the first time. Already in the season 1989–90 the club played against relegation. In the following years, Borussia placed in the midfield of the league. In the 1991–92 season Borussia played again a good cup season. In the Cup semi-final goalkeeper <a href="Uwe%20Kamps">Uwe Kamps</a> held on penalties all four penalties of the players of <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer 04 Leverkusen</a>. Borussia reached the final. The final on 23 May 1992 saw the Mönchengladbachers lose against the club from second division <a href="Hannover">Hannover</a> 96 3:4 on penalties.
In 1993, the club signed the players <a href="Heiko%20Herrlich">Heiko Herrlich</a> and <a href="Patrik%20Andersson">Patrik Andersson</a>, and in 1994, <a href="Stefan%20Effenberg">Stefan Effenberg</a> came back, who played for Borussia Mönchengladbach from 1987 to 1990. Under coach <a href="Bernd%20Krauss">Bernd Krauss</a>, they managed a renewed connection to the Bundesliga top end. In the 1994–95 season came the first trophy for Borussia since 1979, where they won the DFB-Pokal with a 3–0 victory over <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a>. Borussia would also win the Supercup against the German champions Borussia Dortmund a few months later.
1996–2010: firm decline and new stadium.
The team's performance slipped significantly in the 1990s and "Die Fohlen" soon found themselves struggling in the lower half of the Bundesliga table.
After the first round of the 1996–97 season, Borussia finished 17th place in the table. The club dismissed coach Krauss due to the sporting failure. At the end of the season, the Mönchengladbacher were in 11th place. None of the other four coaches to Krauss remained in office for more than a year. Under <a href="Friedel%20Rausch">Friedel Rausch</a> could Borussia only hold the bundesliga position after a dramatic season finale in 1998. Before the last matchday, the Borussia were three points behind a relegation zone. On the final day of the season succeeded a 2–0 away win at <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a>; <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a> lost to <a href="Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a> and went down due to the worse goal difference.
In the international arena, the season was disappointing despite two victories in the first round of the UEFA Cup against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. Borussia lost in the second round of the first leg 2–4 against AS Monaco, the most recent victory Borussia reached with a 1–0 in Monaco, but were eliminated from the competition. In the season 1998–99 Borussia won 3–0 against FC Schalke 04 on Matchday 1 and was at the top of the table for the first time in 13 years. As a result, the team lost six matches and drew two draws, so they stood on the ninth day at the bottom of the table. On the tenth and eleventh round followed by a 2:8 defeat against Bayer 04 Leverkusen and a 1:7 at Vfl Wolfsburg two high defeats in a row. The team remained until the end of the season in 18th place. After a total of 21 lost games, the consequence was the first descent from the Bundesliga. As a consequence of the descent, several top performers, including goalkeeper <a href="Robert%20Enke">Robert Enke</a>, defender <a href="Patrik%20Andersson">Patrik Andersson</a>, and midfielder <a href="Karlheinz%20Pflipsen">Karlheinz Pflipsen</a>, and <a href="Sebastian%20Deisler">Sebastian Deisler</a> all left the club.
Finally, in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Bundesliga">1999</a>, Gladbach were relegated to <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, where they would spend two seasons. Upon returning to the Bundesliga in 2001, Mönchengladbach remained uninspired as they continued to be mired in the bottom half of the league.
The first season in the 2. Bundesliga started the same way as the previous one ended. In the DFB Cup, the team were knocked out early after a lost penalty shootout against the regional league SC Verl. The second division season 1999–2000 ended the Borussia despite bad first round still on the fifth place in the table. Four points were missing for direct promotion.
On 1 August 2000, Borussia Mönchengladbach celebrated the 100-year anniversary of the club. As part of the celebrations, next to coach <a href="Hennes%20Weisweiler">Hennes Weisweiler</a> the following players were elected by Borussia supporters in the so-called century Elf: As goalkeeper <a href="Wolfgang%20Kleff">Wolfgang Kleff</a>, in defence <a href="Berti%20Vogts">Berti Vogts</a>, <a href="Hans-G%C3%BCnter%20Bruns">Hans-Günter Bruns</a>, <a href="Wilfried%20Hannes">Wilfried Hannes</a> and <a href="Patrik%20Andersson">Patrik Andersson</a>, in midfield <a href="Rainer%20Bonhof">Rainer Bonhof</a>, <a href="Stefan%20Effenberg">Stefan Effenberg</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Wimmer">Herbert Wimmer</a>, and <a href="G%C3%BCnter%20Netzer">Günter Netzer</a>, and in attack <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> and <a href="Allan%20Simonsen">Allan Simonsen</a>. Later, large-format posters with images of the players on the north and east sides were attached to the steel exterior of the stadium in Borussia Park.
In the 2000–01 season, the team was able to celebrate as a runner-up in the Bundesliga 2 re-emergence in the Bundesliga and reached the semi-finals of the DFB Cup, but were knocked out as in the previous year against a Regionalligisten ( <a href="1%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">1 FC Union Berlin</a> ) on penalties. Borussia won first place in the national <a href="fair%20play%20ranking">fair play ranking</a> in 2002 in the draw for a place in the UEFA Cup, but the lot was not drawn. Also in the season 2003–04 Borussia missed participation in the UEFA Cup. On 17 March 2004, the Borussia were eliminated by a 0–1 defeat against the then second division <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Alemannia Aachen</a> in the semi-finals of the DFB Cup. A victory against the Alemannia would have been enough, because the final opponent <a href="Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> was already qualified for the UEFA Champions League due to the table position. The season was under the motto "Bye Bye Bökelberg", because on 22 May 2004, the last Bundesliga match took place in <a href="B%C3%B6kelbergstadion">Bökelbergstadion</a>. The Borussia defeated <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">TSV 1860 Munich</a> 3:1; the last goal on Bökelberg was headed by <a href="Arie%20van%20Lent">Arie van Lent</a>. <a href="Uwe%20Kamps">Uwe Kamps</a> came on in the 82nd minute and came to his 457th match in the Bundesliga.
In 2004, Mönchengladbach appointed <a href="Dick%20Advocaat">Dick Advocaat</a>, who had guided the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands national team</a> to the semi-finals of <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004">UEFA Euro 2004</a> and was a successful manager at <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>, as their new coach. However, Advocaat was unable to turn the team's fortunes and resigned in April of the following year. Former Mönchengladbach player and German international <a href="Horst%20K%C3%B6ppel">Horst Köppel</a> was appointed caretaker for the remaining five fixtures of the season. Köppel had managed the club's reserves since leaving <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> in June 2004. For the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07 season</a>, legendary Mönchengladbach player and coach <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> was appointed as team coach.
Borussia had taken steps to improve their financial situation with the construction of a new state-of-the-art stadium called <a href="Borussia-Park">Borussia-Park</a> with a permitted capacity of 59,771 spectators (limited to 54,067 for Bundesliga games and to 46,249 for international games). The club had long been hindered by playing in a much smaller and older facility (<a href="B%C3%B6kelberg">Bökelberg</a>, capacity 34,500) and with the opening of the new stadium in 2004 can look forward to increased revenues through higher ticket sales and the ability to host lucrative international matches.
On the 31st matchday of the 2006–07 season, Borussia Mönchengladbach were relegated from the Bundesliga after fellow relegation fighters <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a> upset <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> 3–2, while Mönchengladbach lost 1–0 at home to VfB Stuttgart. They were promoted back to the Bundesliga on the 32nd match-day of the 2007–08 season after winning the match against <a href="SV%20Wehen">SV Wehen</a> 3–0.
2010–2017: revival.
For the 110th anniversary of the club, the club brought out a DVD on which the club's story is told in a 110-minute film. On 28 July 2010, it was premiered in a cinema in Mönchengladbach.
In the DFB Cup 2010–11 for the first time after five years the round of 16 was reached. In the Bundesliga they succeeded after 16 years in getting the first victory against <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer 04 Leverkusen</a>, but at the end of the preliminary round, the club were in last place.
Due to the seasonally poor athletic performance, a merger of leaders from the local economy founded the "initiative Borussia", which accused the club management of mismanagement. According to the initiative, the old, encrusted structures should be dissolved in order to give Borussia a future. So the money should be invested in the sport rather than in the planned museum complex with attached hotel. At the 2011 Annual General Meeting, only 335 of the 4769 members present voted in favour of the initiative's goals.
At the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> home game against <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">1. FSV Mainz 05</a>, <a href="Marco%20Reus">Marco Reus</a> scored the 2500th Bundesliga goal in the 1445th game. Other Jubiläumstorschützen were <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> (500), <a href="Carsten%20Nielsen">Carsten Nielsen</a> (1000), <a href="Uwe%20Rahn">Uwe Rahn</a> (1500), and <a href="Martin%20Dahlin">Martin Dahlin</a> (2000).
The first newcomer in the winter break was the free transfer of striker <a href="Mike%20Hanke">Mike Hanke</a> of <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a>. The defence was reinforced with <a href="H%C3%A5vard%20Nordtveit">Håvard Nordtveit</a> and <a href="Martin%20Stranzl">Martin Stranzl</a>. On 13 February 2011, Michael Frontzeck was dismissed due to continued failure as a coach. Decisive were defeats against the direct relegation competitors VfB Stuttgart and FC St. Pauli. <a href="Lucien%20Favre">Lucien Favre</a> was hired as the new head coach. After the team had been in the last place in the table until the 30th match day, they achieved three wins in a row and reached after a 1–1 draw at the last game day 16th place, which allowed one last chance to remain in the league. Borussia competed in two relegation matches against the second league team VfL Bochum and were able to prevent relegation with a 1–0 at home and a 1–1 draw in Bochum.
Under Favre, who took over in January 2011, Borussia Mönchengladbach has in recent years shown ambitions to re-establish themselves in the top regions of the Bundesliga. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a>, after a disastrous first half of the season, Borussia Mönchengladbach managed to narrowly avoid relegation through the post-season relegation play-offs.
The following season, <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Bundesliga">2011–12</a>, followed this up with a strong season in which they were for much of the year in contention for the championship and eventually finished in fourth place. They missed out on qualification to the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2012–13 UEFA Champions League</a> after losing 4–3 on aggregate to Ukrainian club <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a> in the playoff round. During the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13 Bundesliga</a> season, after losing some key players, notably <a href="Marco%20Reus">Marco Reus</a> who was voted player of the year in the Bundesliga in the previous season, Borussia Mönchengladbach still contended for the international places until the last match day, eventually finishing in eighth place.
In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bundesliga">2013–14 Bundesliga</a> season, they had another very successful year, achieving an excellent third-place after the first half of the season and finishing the season in sixth place, entering them into the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2014–15</a> Europa League competition at the play-off stage. They finished the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15 Bundesliga</a> season in third place, saving the club a place for direct qualification to the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2015–16 UEFA Champions League</a> group stage. The club found itself in a tough group, together with <a href="Juventus%20FC">Juventus</a>, <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, and <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, and, although they finished bottom of the group, they claimed a respectable points tally of five, claiming draws home and away against Juventus and defeating eventual <a href="2014%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20final">Europa League winners</a> Sevilla 4–2 at home.
After a poor start to the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16 Bundesliga</a> season, including five defeats, Favre resigned and was replaced with <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Schubert">André Schubert</a> as interim coach. The club's fortunes immediately changed, as it won six-straight Bundesliga matches and eventually finishing the season in fourth position, earning qualification to the Champions League for a second successive season.
In the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach%20season">2016–17 season</a>, Borussia drew a difficult group in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, but managed to finish in third place above <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> and qualify for the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20knockout%20phase">UEFA Europa League knockout phase</a>. However, after a promising start in the Bundesliga, the club experienced a poor run of form exacerbated by injuries, and had dropped to the 14th position by the winter break. As a result, André Schubert resigned and was replaced by ex-VfL Wolfsburg manager <a href="Dieter%20Hecking">Dieter Hecking</a>. Hecking began with three wins in four Bundesliga matches as Borussia rose to ninth place and also earned a place in the quarter-finals of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>.
2017–present: ascent to the top half of the table.
A new record transfer was made by the club for the season. For the German international and world champion <a href="Matthias%20Ginter">Matthias Ginter</a>, the club transferred 17 million euros plus bonus payments to <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>.
In the ninth edition of the <a href="Telekom%20Cup">Telekom Cup</a>, Borussia had as early as January of the same year again to be content with the fourth and last place after a defeat on penalties against <a href="Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> and against <a href="TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim">TSG 1899 Hoffenheim</a>. The first round of the DFB Cup 2017–18 was able to make Borussia victorious. The VfL won the West duel against <a href="Rot-Weiss%20Essen">Rot-Weiss Essen</a> 2–1. In the league prelude, the "Fohlenelf" kept by a goal of <a href="Nico%20Elvedi">Nico Elvedi</a> 1–0 in the <a href="German%20football%20rivalries%23North%20Rhine-Westphalia">Rheinland derby</a> against <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> the upper hand and "overwintered" after a final 3–1 home win against <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> to half-time as sixth with 28 points from eight wins, four draws and five defeats. In the DFB Cup Borussia were eliminated on 20 December 2017 in the last competitive game of the year after a 0–1 defeat in the second round against <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer 04 Leverkusen</a> in the <a href="Borussia-Park">Borussia-Park</a> at home, after the "Werkself" had already on the 9th matchday of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> at the same place won 5–1. The second round match failed; the decisive goal to 1–2 defeat at <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> fell in the fifth minute of stoppage time. By contrast, the financial data in the 2017 financial year was more positive. Despite a lack of participation in international competitions, the association posted the second-best result in its history with a turnover of 179.3 million euros and a profit after tax of 6.56 million euros after the record year 2016. The 2017–18 season ended for Borussia after a 1–2 defeat at <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> left them in ninth place and thus missed, as in the previous year, the qualification for the European competitions. The game was also the last for Hamburg in the highest German league after 55 years of uninterrupted affiliation.
In July 2018, the French striker <a href="Alassane%20Pl%C3%A9a">Alassane Pléa</a> from <a href="OGC%20Nice">OGC Nice</a> arrived for the record sum of 23 million euros. In the first round of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20DFB-Pokal">2018–19 DFB-Pokal</a> Mönchengladbach defeated <a href="BSC%20Hastedt">BSC Hastedt</a> 11–1. Thus, Borussia surpassed the previous record, which had been set by the club in an 8–0 victory in the away game at <a href="1.%20FC%20Viersen">1. FC Viersen</a> in the first round of the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20DFB-Pokal">1977–78 DFB-Pokal</a>.
In the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bundesliga">2019–20 Bundesliga</a>, Mönchengladbach started the season well, and was on top of the league in December 2019, after defeating <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 2–1. However, a shaky run of results in the second half of the season meant they ultimately finished in fourth place, 17 points behind champions Bayern. Monchengladbach thus qualified for the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, and were drawn against <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a>, Real Madrid, and <a href="Shakhtar%20Donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a>. Borussia achieved their largest win in the Champions League with a 6–0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk, with <a href="Alassane%20Pl%C3%A9a">Alassane Pléa</a> scoring a hat-trick. They advanced to the knockout stage after finishing second place in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Group%20B">Group B</a>, but were ultimately knocked out in the round of 16 by <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>.
In 2022, Borussia Mönchengladbach struck a strategic partnership with LEYU SPORT.
And LEYU became Official Regional Partner of Borussia Mönchengladbach, which made meaningful progress in Asian market.
Culture.
In addition to celebrity fans like <a href="Theo%20Zwanziger">Theo Zwanziger</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Thierse">Wolfgang Thierse</a>, <a href="Sven%20Ottke">Sven Ottke</a>, Kai Ebel, <a href="Mickie%20Krause">Mickie Krause</a>, <a href="Matthias%20Opdenh%C3%B6vel">Matthias Opdenhövel</a>, <a href="Peer%20Steinbr%C3%BCck">Peer Steinbrück</a>, and <a href="Hannelore%20Kraft">Hannelore Kraft</a>, there are fan clubs in many countries, as far as <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. A known fan group of the club were "Steinwegs Mamm", who provided the drum in the 1960s for the team, and Ethem Özenrenler, known by his nickname "Manolo", who beat the drum in the northern curve of the Bökelberg Stadium for over 25 years since 1977.
Friendships and rivalries.
Friendship with FSV Mainz 05.
After the DFB Cup match against the <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">1. FSV Mainz 05</a> on 25 October 1994, a 6–4 win for <a href="M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Mönchengladbach</a>, a fan friendship developed between Mainz and Borussia, which is now maintained by only a few supporters.
Friendship with Liverpool F.C..
On the other hand, there is a long friendship with <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, which comes from the time both teams regularly met in international games. Fans of Borussia travel to Liverpool at regular intervals to watch local Reds games. Conversely, followers from Liverpool still use a visit to Mönchengladbach to symbolise the mutual fan friendship of both clubs. The fans of Mönchengladbach collected 21,000 DM for the families of the 96 dead in the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">stadium disaster in Sheffield</a> (1989) and presented it to Liverpool FC in 1991 in Mönchengladbach. For the 110th anniversary of the club on 1 August 2010, Liverpool FC were the opponents in a friendly match. The match in front of 51,515 spectators in the Borussia Park Mönchengladbach was won by Borussia, 1–0.
Rivalry with FC Köln.
By contrast, there is a strong sporting rivalry between Mönchengladbach and the regional rival <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>. Widely considered the most severe of Mönchengladbach's rivalries, the animosities between Mönchengladbach and Cologne had their spark in 1964, when Cologne manager <a href="Hennes%20Weisweiler">Hennes Weisweiler</a> switched allegiance in favour of Mönchengladbach. Weisweiler is a central figure in both clubs' mythologies; the mascot of Cologne is named "Hennes" in his honour, whereas Mönchengladbach venerates Weisweiler as the coach of its "team of the century". Mönchengladbach's stadium, <a href="Borussia-Park">Borussia-Park</a>, is furthermore located at a road named "Hennes-Weisweiler-Allee" in Weisweiler's memory.
This initial outrage on behalf of FC Köln supporters was soon met with a serious sporting rivalry: Although Cologne initially had had the athletic edge as a founding member of the Bundesliga and the league's first champion, Mönchengladbach quickly closed the gap. Between the seasons <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Bundesliga">1969–70</a> and <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Bundesliga">1977–78</a>, Mönchengladbach won five championships, Cologne won one, and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">FC Bayern Munich</a> secured the remaining three. The 77–78 season has become remembered in both club's collective memories: Although Mönchengladbach defeated Borussia Dortmund in the <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach%2012%E2%80%930%20Borussia%20Dortmund">highest victory in Bundesliga history</a> with a crushing 12–0, Cologne carried the championship with a 5–0 win over <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a> due to their slightly better <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a> (+45 versus +42 in Cologne's favour). To add insult to injury, Cologne was back under the leadership of Hennes Weisweiler, the personified point of contention between both clubs.
Although neither club has been able to win a Bundesliga title since the 1977–78 season, the rivalry remains, with several incidents of violence between supporters of both clubs. Overall, Mönchengladbach has been more successful in matches between the two, winning 54 out of 105 duels, drawing 20 and losing 31. Notably, Mönchengladbach is more likely to win than FC Köln even in away matches (24–10–17 in Mönchengladbach's favour). The very first iteration of Borussia vs FC Köln was played on 1 January 1961 in front of a crowd of 11,000 in <a href="Oberliga%20West%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga West (1947–63)</a>. Cologne defeated Mönchengladbach 4–1.
Songs.
The official club anthem is the song "The Eleven of the Lower Rhine", which is sung before every home game. The song was recorded by the group BO, the band of the fan project. Next to them are the songs "We are Borussia" and "The soul burns" a permanent place in the fan scene. The anthem by <a href="Gerry%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Pacemakers">Gerry & the Pacemakers</a>, "<a href="You%27ll%20Never%20Walk%20Alone">You'll Never Walk Alone</a>", which is sung by numerous clubs around Europe is frequently heard.
The <a href="Goal%20celebration%23Goal%20song">goal song</a> (), which is heard after every home game, is the refrain of <a href="Scooter%20%28band%29">Scooter</a>'s "<a href="Maria%20%28I%20Like%20It%20Loud%29">Maria (I Like It Loud)</a>". It is accompanied by the sonorous announcement "Tor für die Borussia", by <a href="Rolf%20G%C3%B6ttel">Rolf Göttel</a>, who worked as honorary announcer of Borussia in Bökelbergstadion for decades.
Mascot.
A first mascot was created by manager Helmut Grasshoff and was called "Bumsi". The head was a <a href="Telstar">Telstar</a>-style ball with eyes and black, curly hair. The official <a href="mascot">mascot</a> of the club since the season opener in 1998 is the foal "Jünter", whose name refers to the Mönchengladbach native and longtime Borussia player <a href="G%C3%BCnter%20Netzer">Günter Netzer</a>.

In addition to <a href="Association%20football">football</a>, the club also operates in several other sports.
On 2 June 1900, Germania 1896 and FG Kaiserslautern merged to create FC 1900. In 1909, the club went on to join FC Palatia (founded in 1901) and FC Bavaria (founded in 1902) to form FV 1900 Kaiserslautern. In 1929, they merged with SV Phönix to become FV Phönix-Kaiserslautern, before finally taking on their current name in 1933.
As a founding member of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, FCK played from 1963 to 1996 uninterrupted in the top division. It has won four <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">German championships</a>, two <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>s, and one <a href="DFL-Supercup">DFL-Supercup</a>, and historically is among the most successful football clubs in Germany, currently occupying eleventh place in the <a href="all-time%20Bundesliga%20table">all-time Bundesliga table</a>. The club's international performances include reaching the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Quarter-finals">quarter-finals</a> in 1999, as well as two participations in the UEFA Cup semi-finals. Their first league title in the Bundesliga era was won in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Bundesliga">1991</a>. Kaiserslautern then won the German championship in the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Bundesliga">1997–98 season</a> as a newly promoted team, which is unique in German football. After a six-year spell in the second tier, in 2018 they were relegated to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> for the first time. In 2022, Kaiserslautern was promoted again to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, because they won the promotion playoff.
Since 1920, Kaiserslautern's stadium has been the <a href="Fritz-Walter-Stadion">Fritz-Walter-Stadion</a>, named in 1985 after <a href="Fritz%20Walter">Fritz Walter</a>, the captain of the West Germany national team who won the World Cup in <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954</a>. Walter spent his entire career at Kaiserslautern.
History.
Early years through World War II.
Two of the club's predecessors, Bavaria and FC 1900 Kaiserslautern, were part of the <a href="Westkreis-Liga">Westkreis-Liga</a> (I) when this league was formed in 1908, with the latter winning the first league. From 1909 through 1918, the new FV Kaiserslautern performed well, finishing runners-up in 1910 and 1912. The team reached tier one in the new <a href="Kreisliga%20Saar">Kreisliga Saar</a> in 1919, the <a href="Kreisliga%20Pfalz">Kreisliga Pfalz</a> in 1920 and the <a href="Bezirksliga%20Rhein-Saar">Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar</a> in 1931 and spent the rest of the 1930s bouncing up and down between the Bezirksliga and the upper level <a href="Gauliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Gauliga Südwest</a>, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.
The club's performance was unremarkable in the years leading up to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, but improved after 1939. They captured the Gauliga Südwest/Staffel Saarpfalz title, but lost the overall division title to Staffel Mainhessen winners <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a>. In the 1941–42 season the Gauliga Südwest was split into the <a href="Gauliga%20Hessen-Nassau">Gauliga Hessen-Nassau</a> and the <a href="Gauliga%20Westmark">Gauliga Westmark</a>, and Kaiserslautern took the Westmark title, going on to play for the first time in the national final rounds. They were decisively put out 3–9 by eventual champions <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, the dominant side in this era of German football.
The performance of the team slipped and they finished last in their division in 1944. The following year saw the collapse of league play as Nazi Germany crumbled under the advance of Allied armies.
Postwar play.
After the war, southwestern Germany was part of the occupation zone held by the French. Teams there were organized into northern and southern divisions, and played to determine which of them would join the new Oberliga being put together. French authorities were slow to loosen their control over play in their zones of occupation, and, in the <a href="Saarland">Saarland</a> in particular, teams in the French areas took longer to join the re-established Germany national league than in other parts of the country. 1. FC Kaiserslautern resumed play in the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCdwest%20%281945-63%29">Oberliga Südwest</a> in 1945, and finished the season just one point behind <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a>. The next season, they easily won the Gruppe Nord in 1947 due in large part due to the play of <a href="Fritz%20Walter%20%281920%E2%80%932002%29">Fritz Walter</a> and his brother <a href="Ottmar%20Walter">Ottmar</a> – the duo scored 46 goals between them, more than any other entire team.
Success in the 1950s and entry to the Bundesliga.
This marked the beginning of the club's dominance of the Oberliga Südwest as they went on to capture the division title eleven times over the next twelve seasons. FCK advanced to Germany's first post-war national final in 1948, but lost 1–2 to <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>.
Kaiserslautern became a presence on the national scene through the early 1950s, capturing their first German championship in 1951 with a 2–1 victory of their own, this time over <a href="SC%20Preu%C3%9Fen%20M%C3%BCnster">Preußen Münster</a>. They won a second title in 1953, followed by two losing final appearances in 1954 and 1955. The club also sent five players to the national side for the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954 FIFA World Cup</a>, which <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a> won in what became popularly known as "<a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">The Miracle of Bern</a>".
Kaiserslautern's performance fell off late in the decade and into the early 1960s, the only highlight being an advance to the 1961 <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> final, where they lost 0–2 to <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>. The side recovered its form in time to again win their division on the eve of the formation in 1963 of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional football league. This secured them one of the 16 places in the new top flight circuit. However, the club's next honours would be some time in coming: they made failed German Cup final appearances in 1972, 1976, and 1981 and were UEFA Cup semi-finalists in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20UEFA%20Cup">1982</a> (losing narrowly to eventual winners <a href="IFK%20G%C3%B6teborg">IFK Göteborg</a>). In that time from 1974 to 1984 <a href="Ronnie%20Hellstr%C3%B6m">Ronnie Hellström</a> as goalkeeper, among others has shaped the time. The club could finally win the domestic Cup in <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20DFB-Pokal">1990</a>. They followed up the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Bundesliga">next season</a> with their first Bundesliga championship. Both times the manager was <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Feldkamp">Karl-Heinz Feldkamp</a>.
Rise and fall from the top flight.
1. FCK won a second German Cup in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20DFB-Pokal">1996</a>, but that victory was soured since the team had been relegated to <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> with a 16th-place finish just one week before the Cup final. At the time, Kaiserslautern was one of only four of the original 16 teams that had played in each Bundesliga season since the inception of the league, having never been relegated. This group also included <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> (who went down in the same season), <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> (down in 1998), and "the Dinosaur", <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>, whose spell ended in 2018.
The "Red Devils" came storming back with an accomplishment unique in Bundesliga history – and very rare across the major European football leagues, by winning promotion from the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> at the first attempt in 1997, and immediately going on to win the national championship under veteran coach <a href="Otto%20Rehhagel">Otto Rehhagel</a>. They also played in the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1998–99 UEFA Champions League</a>, where they topped a group comprising <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a>, <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> and <a href="Helsingin%20Jalkapalloklubi">HJK Helsinki</a>, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by compatriots <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, who also took back the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Bundesliga">domestic title</a> (FCK finished 5th).
The club, however, found itself in serious trouble soon after. Despite coming close to a UEFA Cup final in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Cup">2001</a>, Kaiserslautern soon found itself on the brink of bankruptcy, and at the centre of a controversy being played out publicly. The club's management – <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Friedrich">Jürgen Friedrich</a>, Robert Wieschemann and Gerhard Herzog – were forced out. A new team president, Rene C. Jäggi, sold the debt-ridden Fritz-Walter-Stadion to an entity owned by the Land <a href="Rheinland-Pfalz">Rheinland-Pfalz</a> and the city of Kaiserslautern, thus saving the club from financial disaster, while a new coach, <a href="Erik%20Gerets">Erik Gerets</a>, led a run after the winter break that moved the footballers out of last place and saved them from relegation.
The club started the 2003–04 season under the burden of a three-point penalty imposed by the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> for its financial misdeeds. After a faltering start to the season, Gerets was fired and replaced by <a href="Kurt%20Jara">Kurt Jara</a>. Jara was unpopular with the FCK faithful for his defensive football philosophy, but with him at the helm, the club had a safe season. Jara, however, quit the position before the season ended, citing irreconcilable differences with club management.
2005–present.
In 2005, <a href="Michael%20Henke">Michael Henke</a>, who served as long-time assistant to Germany's most successful coach <a href="Ottmar%20Hitzfeld">Ottmar Hitzfeld</a>, became coach. FCK was initially successful, but then suffered a string of reverses and crashed to the bottom of the table. Henke was fired, and FCK alumnus <a href="Wolfgang%20Wolf">Wolfgang Wolf</a> took up the trainer's role. Wolf brought in many young, home-grown players, but, despite winning over fans and experts alike, the 2005–06 season ended in failure as FCK was once again relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after a nine-year stay in the top flight. They finished the 2006–07 season in sixth place in the 2. Bundesliga, seven points out of the promotion places.
On 20 May 2007, the club announced the Norwegian manager <a href="Kjetil%20Rekdal">Kjetil Rekdal</a>, formerly with Belgian side <a href="Lierse%20SK">Lierse</a>, as their new head coach. Rekdal took over the reins on 1 July. Due to very bad results (the club being in 16th place in the standings, with only three wins in 19 games), Rekdal was sacked and replaced by <a href="Milan%20%C5%A0a%C5%A1i%C4%87">Milan Šašić</a> in February 2008. In April 2008, the club hired <a href="Stefan%20Kuntz">Stefan Kuntz</a> as chairman, and with new leadership at the helm, managed to save themselves from relegation to the new <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> with a win over already promoted 1. FC Köln on the final day of the 2007–08 season.
Šašić lasted almost the entire <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%202.%20Bundesliga">2008–09 season</a>, but was dismissed on 4 May 2009 after a run of poor results in the second half of the season, and three days after a 1–5 defeat by <a href="F.C.%20Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a>. Alois Schwartz was named interim coach, and he managed the club to a seventh-place finish on the season. The club eventually hired <a href="Marco%20Kurz">Marco Kurz</a> as head coach.
Under Kurz, the club secured promotion to the 1. Bundesliga on 25 April 2010, after four years in the second league. At the start of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a>, newly promoted 1. FCK had a promising two-straight wins, including a 2–0 victory over the previous year's Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich. However, after a hard-fought 2–1 defeat at <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">Mainz 05</a> and a 5–0 drubbing at eventual season champions <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, the club began to struggle, and fell back to just ahead of the relegation zone. The club then had a poor start to the second half of the season – dropping into the relegation zone for several weeks – but managed to coalesce, and, eventually, earned seven victories in their last ten matches, recording only two defeats and a single draw. They ended this run with four straight victories, to finish the season at the seventh place.
The following season, <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Bundesliga">2011–12</a>, the club finished in the bottom 18th place, and after two seasons in the top flight, were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. They remained in that division until <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%202.%20Bundesliga">2018</a>, being relegated to the <a href="3.%20Liga">third tier</a> for the first time in club history.
In March 2022, a U.S. consortium consisting of Paul Conway, <a href="Chien%20Lee">Chien Lee</a>, Michael Kalt, Krishen Sud and Randy Frankel bought 10% of the club.
On 24 May 2022, four years after their first relegation into Germany's third division, Kaiserslautern were promoted back to the 2. Bundesliga.
Reserve team.
The club's reserve team, <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern%20II">1. FC Kaiserslautern II</a>, played as 1. FC Kaiserslautern Amateure until 2005. It made a first appearance in the tier three <a href="Amateurliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Amateurliga Südwest</a> in 1957. It won a league championship in 1960 and 1968 but was not entitled to promotion to professional level. In 1978, when the <a href="Oberliga%20Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar">Oberliga Südwest</a> was introduced the team qualified for this new league which it would belong to, with the exception of the 1982–83 season, until 1992. It won promotion back to the Oberliga in 1994 and became a <a href="Yo-yo%20club">yo-yo team</a> between this league and the <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a> above, a league newly introduced in 1994. The team was relegated from the latter in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2007 but each time won promotion back to the league. Between 2012 and 2017, the club played in the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga Südwest</a>.
The team has also won the <a href="Southwestern%20Cup">Southwestern Cup</a> on three occasions, in 1979, 1997 and 2008. Through this competition, 1. FC Kaiserslautern II qualified for the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> on three occasions, reaching the second round twice and being drawn against their own first team in 1997–98 where they lost 5–0.
Stadium.
FCK plays its home fixtures in the <a href="Fritz%20Walter%20Stadion">Fritz Walter Stadion</a> first built in 1920. In 1985 the stadium and the adjacent street were named for the player who brought the club to prominence after World War II. The facility is built on the Betzenberg, literally "Mount Betze", a steep sandstone hill.
The stadium has a capacity of 49,850 and was a <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a> venue, hosting four preliminary round and one group of 16-round matches. The facility underwent a major refurbishment for the tournament with addition of new grandstands and a roof.
Club culture.
Kaiserslautern's Fritz-Walter-Stadion has long been a feared away venue given the rabid ferocity of Kaiserslautern fans: the most faithful of these supporters are located in the stadium's "Westkurve" (Westside, literally "West Curve", since the stands used to be shaped in a semicircle behind the goals). Most famously, Bayern Munich once lost a match here in a charged atmosphere by a score of 7–4 after leading 4–1 at the 58th minute.
The club has friendly ties to <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a>, <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>, <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> and <a href="Kilmarnock%20F.C.">Kilmarnock F.C.</a> of Scotland and are bitter rivals of <a href="Waldhof%20Mannheim">Waldhof Mannheim</a> and Bayern Munich. They also have lesser local rivalries with <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> and, more recently, with <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">Mainz 05</a> and <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a>.

Rot-Weiss Essen

Rot-Weiss Essen is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> based in <a href="Essen">Essen</a>, North Rhine-Westphalia. The club currently plays in the 3. Liga, at the <a href="Stadion%20an%20der%20Hafenstra%C3%9Fe">Stadion an der Hafenstraße</a>.
The team won the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> in 1953, and the <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">German championship</a> in 1955. The latter success qualified them to the first season of the <a href="European%20Cup">European Cup</a>.
History.
Early years.
The club was formed as "SV Vogelheim" on 1 February 1907 out of the merger of two smaller clubs: "SC Preussen" and "Deutsche Eiche". In 1910, "Vogelheim" came to an arrangement with "Turnerbund Bergeborbeck" that allowed the two clubs to field a football side. The footballers left in 1913 to set up their own club, "Spiel- und Sportverein Emscher-Vogelheim", which changed its name to "Spiel und Sport 1912" after World War I. Finally, in 1923, this side turned again to "Turnerbund Bergeborbeck" to create "Rot-Weiss Essen".
Breakthrough to the Gauliga.
In 1938, "RWE" broke into top-flight football in the <a href="Gauliga%20Niederrhein">Gauliga Niederrhein</a>, one of sixteen premier divisions formed in the 1933 re-organization of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>, and came within a point of taking the division title in 1941. In 1943, they played with "BV Altenessen" as the combined wartime side "KSG SC Rot-Weiß Essen/BV 06 Altenessen". The next season this club was in turn joined by "BVB Essen", but played only a single match in a stillborn season as World War II overtook the country.
Rise and golden years.
The club returned to first division football in the <a href="Oberliga%20West">Oberliga West</a> in 1948, where a series of solid performances led to a divisional championship in 1952. The pinnacle of the club's success came with a 2–1 win over <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Alemannia Aachen</a> in the 1953 <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> final, followed by a national championship in 1955 when it beat <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> 4–3. The following season, Rot-Weiss became the first German side to qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>.
Their performance tailed off after this and "RWE" became just another mid-table side before they were relegated in 1961. The club then played most of the 1960s as a second division side, though made a first appearance in the top-flight <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Bundesliga">1966–67</a>. It returned to the Bundesliga for two seasons in <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Bundesliga">1969–70</a>, and again, for four seasons beginning in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Bundesliga">1973–74</a>.
Financial problems and slow decline.
Between 1978 and the end of the century, Rot-Weiss was a solid second- or third-tier club, with just one season spent in the <a href="Oberliga%20Nordrhein">Oberliga Nordrhein</a> (IV) in 1998–99. During this period, the club was plagued by financial problems that saw it denied a licence in 1984, 1991, and 1994, leading to relegation from the 2. Bundesliga each time as a result. Bright spots during this period included winning the <a href="German%20amateur%20championship">German amateur championship</a> in 1992 and an appearance in the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20DFB-Pokal">1994 DFB-Pokal</a> final, which they lost 1–3 to <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">SV Werder Bremen</a>.
"RWE" returned to the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a> (III) in 1999, but dropped to the Oberliga (IV) the next season. In 2004, they won promotion back to the 2. Bundesliga, but stumbled to a 17th-place finish and were relegated once again.
In November 2005, <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a> became an honorary club member (membership number 23101940).
The team reappeared in the 2. Bundesliga after winning the Regionalliga Nord in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Regionalliga">2006</a>, but narrowly missed staying up when they lost the critical final match of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%202.%20Bundesliga">2006–07 season</a> 3–0 to <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">Duisburg</a>.
Rot-Weiss became a fourth division side following the introduction of the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> in 2008 and a fifth division team after insolvency in 2010. They won the fifth level <a href="NRW-Liga">NRW-Liga</a> in 2010–11 and returned to <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Regionalliga">2011–12 season</a>.
Stadium.
Until 2012 Rot-Weiss used to play in the <a href="Georg-Melches-Stadion">Georg-Melches-Stadion</a> (capacity 15,000), named in honour of a former club president. In 1956, the team's home field became the first stadium in West Germany to have floodlights.
Since August 2012, RWE has played in the new <a href="Stadion%20Essen">Stadion Essen</a> (capacity 20,000). The naming rights to the stadium include <a href="RWE">RWE AG</a>.
Supporters.
Rivalries.
<a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>, <a href="Rot-Wei%C3%9F%20Oberhausen">Rot-Weiß Oberhausen</a> and <a href="Wuppertaler%20SV">Wuppertaler SV</a> are local rivals when they are playing in the same league (as took place in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Regionalliga">2007–08 season</a>). The club's fiercest rivalry is with <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">FC Schalke 04</a>, from nearby <a href="Gelsenkirchen">Gelsenkirchen</a>, with whom they contest the <a href="List%20of%20association%20football%20rivalries%20in%20Europe%23Germany">Ruhrderby</a>.
In the past, the local derbies versus <a href="Schwarz-Wei%C3%9F%20Essen">Schwarz-Weiß Essen</a> were big events, sometimes followed by more than 30,000 fans, however since their rivals decline the rivalry has waned in importance. Although often clouded in political terms, the "reds" were <a href="left-wing">left-wing</a> and the "blacks" <a href="right-wing">right-wing</a>, in reality there was no real distinction. The rivalry was more based on geography of the city, a north (RWE) versus south (SWE) city divide. While the reputation of northern Essen has been attached to the working class in the past decades, the south of the city is generally regarded as a wealthier area, inhabited by an upper-middle class.
Friendships.
The RWE followers have a strong fan friendship with <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">SV Werder Bremen</a>, while another with <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> ended.
Attendance.
Although mostly playing in lower divisions, the club enjoys solid fan support, with an average attendance of better than 6,000 per game.

SC Preußen Münster

SC Preußen Münster (English: Prussia Münster) is a German sports club based in <a href="M%C3%BCnster">Münster</a>, <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a> which is mostly recognised for its <a href="Association%20football">football</a> section. The football team currently plays in <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> which is the third tier in German football. Preußen Münster also fields teams in <a href="tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="Sport%20of%20athletics">athletics</a>, <a href="futsal">futsal</a>, <a href="handball">handball</a>, <a href="fistball">fistball</a>, <a href="darts">darts</a> and <a href="e-sports">e-sports</a>.
History.
The club was founded as FC Preußen on 30 April 1906 and has its roots in a group formed at the Johann-Conrad-Schlaun Grammar School. Historians consider patriotic reasons for naming the club after Prussia. At first the club did not have its own ground and was playing at a parade ground of the army at Loddenheide. General Baron von Bissing gave permission only if the goals would be taken down again after training. On 24 June 1907 the Eagles won their first game against FC Osnabrück with 5–0. After successfully applying for the Western German League system, the team initially competed in the second tier. In 1908 the Eagles were promoted to the first league and in 1914 they won the Westphalian Championship. Between 1916 and 1926 the club played on Münstermannplatz, which was close to the current ground, the <a href="Preu%C3%9Fenstadion">Preußenstadion</a>. In 1921 they won the Championship a second time and also took on their current name.
In 1933, Preußen advanced to the <a href="Gauliga%20Westfalen">Gauliga Westfalen</a>, one of sixteen top-flight leagues established through the re-organization of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>. They earned only mediocre results there and were relegated twice. Their second demotion in 1941 left them out of first division football until after World War II.
The team played three seasons in the Landesliga Westfalen Gr. 2 (II) before returning to the top-flight in the <a href="Oberliga%20West">Oberliga West</a> in the 1948–49 season. That arrival was accompanied by some notoriety, as Preußen Münster became the first German football club to build a team by buying players, something previously unheard of in a country committed to the ideal of amateurism. Siegfried Rachuba, Adolf Preissler, Rudolf Schulz, <a href="Felix%20Gerritzen">Felix Gerritzen</a>, and Josef Lammers formed a front five dubbed by the press as the "Hundred-Thousand-Mark Line", even though that much money never did change hands. Rachuba is still Münsters most successful first tier striker of all times with 97 goals in 238 games.
The investment paid dividends as the club appeared in the <a href="1951%20German%20football%20championship%23Final">1951 national final</a> in front of 107,000 spectators at Berlin's Olympic Stadium against <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a>. Preußen striker Gerritzen scored first but the team lost after two goals from <a href="Ottmar%20Walter">Ottmar Walter</a>.
Founding member of the Bundesliga.
Their results as a mid-table side in the tough Oberliga West in the ten years prior to the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 1963 were good enough to earn Preußen Münster the admission as one of the five teams from that league to earn a place in Germany's new sixteen-team professional circuit. The club made only a cameo appearance in the Bundesliga, being relegated after a next-to-last 15th-place finish.
Post Bundesliga play.
Preußen Münster played out the 1960s and 1970s as a second division side in the Regionalliga West and 2. Bundesliga Nord. In the 1970s the Preußen made several attempts to return to <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. Under club president Günter Wellerdieck (from 1970 to 1978) the club took a considerable financial risk to achieve the promotion to first tier. Preußen failed to do so by finishing on 5th place in the 1973–74 season and on 3rd place in the 1977–78 and 1978–79 seasons. After Wellerdieck and other staff of the club's management resigned due to financial difficulties and accusations of tax fraud in 1978, the decline of Preußen Münster continued. They slipped to the Amateur Oberliga Westfalen (III) in the 1981–82 season, and except for a short adventure in the 2. Bundesliga in the 1990 and 1991 seasons, played third tier football in the Regionalliga West/Sudwest (1993–2000) and Regionalliga Nord until 2006. During this period, they captured the German Amateur Championship in 1994 with a 1–0 win over <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a>.
In 2006, the club was relegated to the <a href="Oberliga%20Westfalen">Oberliga Westfalen</a>, now a fourth tier circuit. Management subsequently invested significant financial resources into a high-profile team of experienced second- and third-tier players in pursuit of immediate re-promotion. The attempt ended in failure and the club re-built itself with young players in place of expensive veterans and also put in place a young and relatively unknown coach, <a href="Roger%20Schmidt%20%28football%20manager%29">Roger Schmidt</a>. The re-worked side finished in first place in the 2007–08 season, and so qualified for the new <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> which replaced the Oberliga in the league system. They ended the season in fourth place in the Regionalliga in 2008–09, and in sixth in 2009–10. For season 2008–09 the club qualified for the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> the first time since season 1997–98 (where they were defeated by <a href="1.FSV%20Mainz%2005">1.FSV Mainz 05</a>). The opponent was <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a> which competed in <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> at that time. After a penalty shootout Preußen lost 5–6. In the following year the Eagles were defeated in the extra time against another first tier team, <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>. The match ended 1–3.
They were finally promoted to <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> after finishing as champions of the West Group of the Regionalliga in the 2010–11 season. The manager of that time was <a href="Marc%20Fascher">Marc Fascher</a>. Preußen were defeated by another Bundesliga team in the German cup, <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> (1–2). The first season 2011–12 in the third tier of German football after five years ended with a 12th place. In the following seasons the team finished significantly better and even had chances to get promoted again to <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. In season 2012–13 they almost succeeded and ended in fourth place. In that season the team was also able to defeat the Bundesliga team <a href="Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> in the first round of the DFB-Pokal, 4–2 after extra time. In the second round the club lost against <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a>. In season 2013–14 they ended in sixth place. Again the club managed to win against a team from a higher league in the DFB-Pokal, <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a> from 2. Bundesliga. In the next round Preußen was defeated again by FC Augsburg.
In the 2014–15 season, the club had a promising start, and was during winter even at the top of the league. Unfortunately the team was not able to keep up the good results and finished 8th. The season 2015–16 also started with good results, but again the team lost ground in the long turn and finished ninth. During the season the club switched managers, from <a href="Ralf%20Loose">Ralf Loose</a> to <a href="Horst%20Steffen">Horst Steffen</a>. The following season brought up big changes in the club administration. After changing the coach from Horst Steffen to the former SCP-player <a href="Benno%20M%C3%B6hlmann">Benno Möhlmann</a> several high ranking positions in the club were also manned with new personalities. To serve as chairman Preußen Münster could win over Christoph Strässer, a former politician of the German <a href="Bundestag">Bundestag</a>. Among others, the board of directors now contains Walther Seinsch who is well known in German football for his work with then fourth tier club <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a>. Furthermore, with Friedrich Lucas the club's board now has a fans' representative for the first time in the history of Preußen Münster. In April 2017, Malte Metzelder manned the position of director of football. He is also a former player of the Eagles.
In 2017, Preußen Münster celebrated the club's 111th anniversary. In celebration, the club used a special anniversary logo in 2017. The logo contained the text "111 Jahre" (111 years) on top and "1906–2017" on the bottom, along with the club's usual <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Prussia">Prussian eagle</a> surrounded by a wreath. The club also gave away 111 <a href="litre">litre</a>s of free <a href="beer">beer</a> to fans at the stadium.
At the end of the 2019-20 season, despite a switch of managers from <a href="Sven%20H%C3%BCbscher">Sven Hübscher</a> to <a href="Sascha%20Hildmann">Sascha Hildmann</a> in the winter break, the club was relegated to Regionalliga West again. Following the relegation Malte Metzelder resigned as director of football and was replaced by former <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> player <a href="Peter%20Niemeyer">Peter Niemeyer</a>. In the following three seasons the club rebuild itself. After a third place in season 2020-21 the Eagles came second in the 2021-22 season and were only three goals short of promotion. Finally in the following season they dominated the league and at the end of the season were promoted to return to <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>.

Stadium.
The club plays at the <a href="Preu%C3%9Fenstadion">Preußenstadion</a>, which was built in 1926. Once considered one of the most modern stadiums in Germany, the arena slowly fell into disrepair which resulted in reducing the capacity from 40,000 in the 1950s to 15,000, and, after removing one stand, to the current 12,754. Construction of a new facility was considered in the 80s, but the idea was abandoned in December 2000. In spring 2008 it was decided to renovate the Preußenstadion, to make the stadium more attractive and fitting to modern standards. The seating area was replaced by a new one including 2,931 seats and VIP lounges. Some of the terraces which were still uncovered got a roof. The works finished in May 2009.
Further plans have been brought up to continue to modernize the stadium and actions were taken in 2014 to change the development plan of the stadium area by the local administration. In December 2018 the local administration granted 40 million Euros to modernize the stadium, which was extended to 60 million in November 2022. To signalize the beginning of modernizations the western stand got torn down at the end of season 2021-22 and has been replaced by a noise barrier that shows a design with several former club legends on it. The club is currently looking for a contractor to rebuild the stands in the west, east and north. This would increase the general capacity to roundabout 20,000 spectators, all of the stands would have a roof. The club also plans to erect two new buildings to have more space for the youth teams and the neighboring basketball club <a href="Uni%20Baskets">Uni Baskets</a> and volleyball club <a href="USC%20M%C3%BCnster">USC Münster</a>. Some improvements in the training facilities have already been made. In 2023 two new training pitches have been completed.
Fans.
Due to the club's promotion from <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> to <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>, average attendance significantly increased. During its years in fourth tier of the German league system, the average crowd never exceeded 4,500 fans, with the exception of the 2010–11 season, during which the club was promoted, with an average attendance of 5,628. In the following years the average crowd grew from 7,025 people in 2011–12 season to 8,986 people in season 2012–13. In season 2013–14 there was a decrease to 7,958 people. The 2020s marked a new spike in the popularity of the club which showed in the average attendance. In the 2022-23 season, which ended in the promotion of the Eagles, the club had an average attendance of 8,752 in fourth tier which comes close to the highest number in third tier in 2012-13. 
The fans of Münster have rivalries especially with supporters of <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a> and <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a>. The close proximity between the three cities which are located within a 65-kilometer radius led the press to the name of the Bermuda Triangle of Münster, Osnabrück and Bielefeld in <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>. Another minor rival of Preußen Münster supporters is <a href="Rot%20Weiss%20Essen">Rot Weiss Essen</a>.
Preußen Münster has currently 3,893 members ("in January 2024").
Part of the club is the "Fangemeinschaft Preußen Münster e. V." which serves as a voice for supporters to club management. It also arranges bus tours to matches and events to support charity organizations in the Münster-area. Furthermore, the Fanprojekt offers a radio during matches for people not present, "Radio Mottekstrehle".

Borussia Neunkirchen

Borussia VfB Neunkirchen is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> based in <a href="Neunkirchen%2C%20Saarland">Neunkirchen, Saarland</a>. The club "SC Borussia Neunkirchen" was founded out of the 1907 merger of "FC 1905 Borussia" and "SC Neunkirchen".
History.
From 1912 through to 1963 the club had an uninterrupted record of first division play including the "<a href="Kreisliga%20Saar">Kreisliga Saar</a>", "<a href="Bezirksliga%20Rhein-Saar">Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar</a>" and selection to the "<a href="Gauliga">Gauliga</a>", formed in 1933 through the reorganization of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>. "Borussia" remained at this level, in the "<a href="Gauliga%20S%C3%BCdwest/Mainhessen">Gauliga Südwest/Mainhessen</a>", throughout the league's history, with good results but not winning a league championship. Like other organizations in the country, including sports and football associations, "Borussia" was dissolved by the Allied occupation authorities after World War II, but was quickly reformed under its current name.
The club played in the French-occupied <a href="Saarland">Saarland</a> and the French made various efforts to see the state become independent of Germany or join France. In sport this was manifested as separate 1952 Olympic and <a href="Football%20World%20Cup%201954%20%28qualification%29">1954 World Cup</a> teams for <a href="Saarland%20national%20football%20team">Saarland</a>, the establishment of a short-lived football league for the state, and the German club "<a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a>" playing in the French second division. "Neunkirchen" played in the Saarland Ehrenliga from 1949 to 1951, winning the title in the first year and finishing as runner-up the next. They were able to re-join the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">DFB</a> (Deutscher Fußball-Bund or German Football Association) after the 1950–51 season in the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCdwest%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Südwest</a>.
Despite their record of continuous play at the top flight, "Neunkirchen" was not one of the sixteen sides selected for play in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> – Germany's new professional football league – at its formation. Along with "<a href="FK%20Pirmasens">FK Pirmasens</a>" and "<a href="Wormatia%20Worms">Wormatia Worms</a>", they were bypassed in favour of "1. FC Saarbrücken", even though they all had better records than the chosen side. More than a few protests were lodged as "1. FC" appeared to have gained entry based simply on their affiliation with a member of the league selection committee. Their entry was delayed by only a year as they were able to play their way into the upper league through the promotion rounds after winning the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest%20%281963%E2%80%931974%29">Regionalliga Südwest</a>.
Their stay in the Bundesliga was short-lived. After a mid-table result in 1965, they would be relegated the following season after a 17th-place finish. They won the Regionalliga Südwest again after being sent down and returned to the Bundesliga to another 17th-place finish and relegation.
"Neunkirchen" spent another seven years playing tier II football before slipping to the <a href="Amateurliga%20Saarland">Amateurliga Saarland</a> (III). Through the mid-1970s and into the early 1980s the club bounced up and down between these levels of play, before settling in for a decade and a half at tier III. The team slipped again in 1996 to the <a href="Fu%C3%9Fball-Oberliga%20Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar">Oberliga Südwest</a> (IV). They won their division in 2005 but declined the opportunity to apply for a license and promotion to the third division because of financial problems that have plagued the club since 2003. From 2012–13 the Oberliga Südwest was renamed Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar, with "Borussia" continuing in this league.
In April 2015 the club had to declare insolvency with a debt of €280,000.

Rot-Weiß Oberhausen

Rot-Weiß Oberhausen is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> in <a href="Oberhausen">Oberhausen</a>, North Rhine-Westphalia. The club was formed as "Oberhausener SV" in December 1904 out of the merger of "Emschertaler SV" (1902) and the football enthusiasts of "Oberhausener TV 1873". The new side entered into a union with "Viktoria Styrum BV" to create "SpVgg 1904 Oberhausen-Styrum", but within six months a number of the club's members left to form "1. FC Mülheim-Styrum". The remaining club members carried on and in 1934 took on their current name.
History.
The team was unremarked through its early history, simply playing local ball. After the re-organization of German football in the early 1930s under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> "Rot Weiss" played in the <a href="Gauliga%20Niederrhein">Gauliga Niederrhein</a> but could never match the strength of division rival <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> the club played alongside <a href="Schwarz-Wei%C3%9F%20Alstaden">ASV Elmar</a> as part of the combined wartime side KSG Elmar/Viktoria Oberhausen.
The club worked its way into the upper league <a href="Oberliga%20West%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga West</a> after the war and with the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional circuit, found themselves in the second division <a href="Regionalliga%20West%20%281963%E2%80%931974%29">Regionalliga West</a>. A first-place finish there in 1969 led to promotion to the Bundesliga for the workmanlike side. The club's turn in the top flight was tainted when they were implicated in the Bundesliga bribery scandal of 1971. While it was clear they were involved, the club and its players escaped sanction. After three years in the upper league without doing any better than a 14th-place finish, the club returned to its existence as a tier II and III side.
Financial problems in 1988 were the prelude to a slide into the <a href="Verbandsliga%20Niederrhein">Verbandsliga Niederrhein</a> (IV) two years later. After nearly a decade spent bouncing up and down between the third and fourth divisions "Die Kleeblätter" returned to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in 1998, winning the <a href="Regionalliga%20West/S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga West/Südwest</a>. They remained a lower table side for the most part, but did manage to put forward their best ever performances with sixth and fifth-place finishes in 2000 and 2004. "Oberhausen" was relegated again to the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a> (III) for 2005. Relegation to the <a href="Oberliga%20%28football%29">Oberliga</a> (IV) followed a year later. They returned to <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> after two successively promotions; which were first in the <a href="Oberliga%20Nordrhein">Oberliga Nordrhein</a> in 2006–07 and second of <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a> in 2007–08 season. The club dropped out of the 2. Bundesliga in 2011, was relegated again the following year from the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> and now plays in the tier four <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a>.

Kickers Offenbach

Offenbacher Fussball-Club Kickers, commonly known as Kickers Offenbach, is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> in <a href="Offenbach%20am%20Main">Offenbach am Main</a>, <a href="Hesse">Hesse</a>. The club was founded on 27 May 1901 in the Rheinischer Hof restaurant by footballers who had left established local clubs including "Melitia", "Teutonia", "Viktoria", "Germania" and "Neptun". From 1921 to 1925 they were united with "<a href="VfB%201900%20Offenbach">VfB 1900 Offenbach</a>" as "VfR Kickers Offenbach" until resuming their status as a separate side, "Offenbacher FC Kickers". Since 2012, Kickers Offenbach's stadium has been the <a href="Sparda%20Bank%20Hessen%20Stadium">Sparda Bank Hessen Stadium</a>.
History.
The club became one of the founding members of the <a href="Nordkreis-Liga">Nordkreis-Liga</a> in 1909, where it played until the outbreak of the war. In post-First World War Germany, "Kickers" played in the <a href="Kreisliga%20S%C3%BCdmain">Kreisliga Südmain</a> (I), winning this league in 1920, 1922 and 1923.
The club played as a mid-table side in the <a href="Bezirksliga%20Main-Hessen">Bezirksliga Main-Hessen</a> through the late 1920s and early 1930s. German football was re-organized in 1933 under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> into sixteen first division Gauligen. "Kickers" joined the <a href="Gauliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Gauliga Südwest</a>, where the team immediately captured the title and entered the national playoffs for the first time. They fared poorly there, but did manage to raise their overall level of play in the following seasons, going on to win five consecutive divisional championships from 1940 to 1944.
In the early 1940s, the Gauliga Südwest had been split into the <a href="Gauliga%20Westmark">Gauliga Westmark</a> and the <a href="Gauliga%20Hessen-Nassau">Gauliga Hessen-Nassau</a>, where "Kickers" played. Their best post-season result came in 1942 when the team was able to advance as far as the semi-finals in the national championship rounds before they were decisively put out 0:6 by "<a href="Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>", who were on their way to their sixth championship as the era's most dominant side. By 1944, Allied armies were rolling through Germany and the Gauliga Hessen-Nassau did not play the 1944–45 season. In their 1953 Asian Tour, they played twelve matches.
Entry to the Bundesliga and scandal.
The club found itself in the new <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963-74%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> (II) and play in the Bundesliga would have to wait until 1968. The team was immediately relegated, but returned to the upper league for play in 1970–71. In addition to their return to the Bundesliga, the club would win one of its few honours in 1970 with a 2:1 <a href="DFB%20Pokal">German Cup</a> victory over <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>.
However, the end of the 1971 season would find Kickers Offenbach at the centre of the <a href="Bundesliga%20scandal%20%281971%29">Bundesliga scandal</a>. The club president, <a href="Horst-Gregorio%20Canellas">Horst-Gregorio Canellas</a>, went to the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (Deutsche Fussball Bund or German Football Association) after being approached by a player from another team looking for a cash bonus for that club's effort in beating one of "Offenbach"'s rivals in the fight against relegation. Receiving no help from league officials, Canellas began gathering evidence of how widespread the payoffs were. In the end more than fifty players from seven clubs, two coaches, and six game officials were found guilty of trying to influence the outcome of games through bribes, but Canellas was unable to save his club from relegation. The club central to the scandal – <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a> – would not be punished until the following season, too late to save Offenbach.
The scandal had a negative effect on the young league and contributed to plummeting attendance figures. One outcome of the whole affair was the further evolution of German football; salary restrictions were removed and the <a href="2.%20Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> also became a professional league. Kickers immediately returned to the top level. The best finish was 7th in the 1972–73 season. They were leaders for 5 rounds and beat <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 6–0 in the 1974–75 season but were relegated to the second level in the 1975–76 season.
Decline and recovery.
"Kickers" spent the next seven years in the 2. Bundesliga before making a return to the Bundesliga for just a single season in 1983–84. In 1985, financial problems led to the club being penalized points and driven into the third division amateur <a href="Oberliga%20Hessen">Oberliga Hessen</a>. They recovered, only to be denied a licence in 1989, and were sent back down again. By the mid-1990s they again slipped into the Oberliga Hessen (IV). They appeared in the final of the national amateur championship in 1994 where they lost 1–0 to <a href="Preu%C3%9Fen%20M%C3%BCnster">Preußen Münster</a>. Offenbach returned the 2. Bundesliga in 1999 and were immediately relegated after a 17th-place finish. In each of these seasons the team took part in the national amateur championship, winning the title in 1999.
The club next appeared in the 2. Bundesliga in 2005. After two lower table finishes, "Kickers" were relegated to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> on the final day of the 2007–08 season following a 3–0 defeat to fellow strugglers <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a>.
On 18 July 2012, the club's new ground, the <a href="Sparda%20Bank%20Hessen%20Stadium">Sparda Bank Hessen Stadium</a>, was opened with a <a href="Exhibition%20game%23Club%20football">pre-season friendly</a> against <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a>. The club was refused a 3. Liga licence at the end of the 2012–13 season and was relegated to the Regionalliga, with <a href="SV%20Darmstadt%2098">SV Darmstadt 98</a> taking its place. The club, €9 million in debt, could have faced insolvency and a restart at the lowest level of the German football league system.
The club won the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga Südwest</a> in 2014–15 and earned the right to take part in the promotion round to the 3. Liga, where they missed out on promotion to <a href="1.%20FC%20Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a>. The loss was overshadowed by approximately 40 Offenbach supporters storming the field in the 84th minute and forcing a twenty-minute interruption to the return leg.

Wuppertaler SV

Wuppertaler SV is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> located in <a href="Wuppertal">Wuppertal</a>, <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>. The city was founded in the year of 1880 by the union of a number of smaller towns including <a href="Elberfeld">Elberfeld</a>, Barmen, Vohwinkel, Cronenberg and Ronsdorf – each with its own football club. Wuppertal Sport Verein was formed in 1904 out of the merger of TSG Vohwinkel and SSV Wuppertal and was later joined by Borussia Wuppertal to form the present day club. In addition to the football side, today's sports club includes departments for <a href="boxing">boxing</a>, gymnastics, <a href="team%20handball">handball</a>, and track and field.
History.
Early history of predecessors TSG and SSV.
TSG was active as a gymnastics club as early as 1880 while the roots of'SSV go back to the 1904 establishment of the winter sports club Bergischer Wintersport-und SV 04 Elberfeld, which was known simply as SSV Elberfeld by 1905. This club took part in the early rounds of the national finals in 1930–31 and went on to play in the <a href="Gauliga%20Niederrhein">Gauliga Niederrhein</a>, one of sixteen top-flight divisions formed in the 1933 re-organization of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>, for two seasons in 1936–37 and 1937–38. The side was re-christened SSV 04 Wuppertal the following year and remained in the Gauliga another two seasons until relegated in 1940. They returned to first tier football in 1941 and earned a strong third-place finish, but left the division part way through the 1942–43 season because they were unable to continue to field a full side as a result of wartime manpower shortages.
Post war play and the formation of WSV.
After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, TSG Vohwinkel emerged as the stronger side and took up play in the first division <a href="Oberliga%20West%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga West</a> in 1947 where they would compete until being relegated after a 14th-place finish in 1950.
Both clubs were part of the <a href="2.%20Oberliga%20West">2. Oberliga West</a> (II) through the early 1950s, SSV under the guidance of coach <a href="Fritz%20Szepan">Fritz Szepan</a>, one-time star of <a href="Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> which had dominated German football from the mid-1930s to the mid-1940s. The union of the two associations that created "Wuppertaler SV" in 1954 paid almost immediate dividends as the combined side vaulted to the top and captured the division title in 1954–55. Wuppertal's return to the Oberliga was less successful despite the presence of players such as rising star <a href="Horst%20Szymaniak">Horst Szymaniak</a> and Austria's international <a href="Erich%20Probst">Erich Probst</a>. The club could not escape the lower half of the table and was relegated following a next-to-last place finish in 1958.
"WSV" returned to the top flight for the 1962–63 campaign, which was the last Oberliga season before the creation of the new first division <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. Although they had a poor regular season, the team enjoyed a good <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> run, advancing to the semi-finals where they lost a closely fought match (0–1) to first division side and eventual cup winners <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> before a record hometown crowd of 40,000.
Rise to the Bundesliga.
The following year, the club became part of the Regionalliga West, one of the five divisions in the newly established second-tier circuit. Wuppertal delivered a solid performance, finishing second in their division behind <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Alemannia Aachen</a>. They remained competitive throughout the remainder of the 1960s and into the early 1970s. In 1972, they achieved a breakthrough by winning the Regionalliga West title and subsequently triumphing in the Bundesliga promotion playoffs. WSV dominated their opposition, winning all eight of their promotion round matches, a remarkable feat in the 11 seasons played under this playoff format.
Bundesliga 1972–75.
"Die Löwen" played three seasons in the top flight with their debut 1972–73 season being their most successful. While they never seriously challenged eventual champions <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> for the title, newly promoted WSV spent five weeks in second place before finally settling for a fourth-place finish – a result that has only been bettered twice by teams newly promoted to the Bundesliga.
The fourth-place finish earned the club a place in the 1973–74 <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> tournament the season after. They went out in the first round 6:8 on aggregate (1–4, 5–4) to Polish side <a href="Ruch%20Chorz%C3%B3w">Ruch Chorzów</a>. In the league that season they only escaped relegation on goal difference after an 82nd minute away goal in the final match of their campaign in <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>.
Widely regarded as having too old a roster to compete, in the third top tier season the club stumbled to an ignominious last place finish on 12 points. This stands as the second-worst Bundesliga result in history, only four points better than the <a href="Tasmania%201900%20Berlin">Tasmania Berlin</a> side of 1965–66. The only bright spot of this poor campaign was a 3–1 victory over the Bayern Munich side built around <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a> that dominated European football at the time.
Post-Bundesliga (1975) to 2013.
After the 1975 relegation from the Bundesliga, Wuppertal next played five seasons in the second tier <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> until 1980. From 1980 the played a dozen seasons in the Amateur Oberliga Nordrhein (III). A series of strong finishes in the late 80s eventually led to a return to the 2. Bundesliga for the 1992–93 and 1993–94 seasons before relegation once again to third tier football in the Regionalliga West/Südwest.
The club had a close brush with bankruptcy in 1998 and the next season was sent down to the Oberliga Nordrhein (IV) for failing to pay their dues. By 2003 they had earned a return to the Regionalliga Nord (III).
In 2004, the club merged with Borussia Wuppertal to become Wuppertaler SV Borussia adopting the red and blue colours and logo of the more senior WSV. Borussia had been formed in 1976 through the union of SV Germania 1907 Wuppertal and VfL 1912 Wuppertal. Like SSV, Germania was also the successor to an Elberfeld club – Germania Elberfeld – which took part in the preliminary rounds of the national finals in the early 30s. While "Borussia" quickly developed into a competitive side, they were not financially strong enough to support their ambition and joined forces with WSV in hopes of returning the city to football prominence. From supporter's side, the additional name Borussia has been constantly rejected, due to the club's history and identification issues. This controversy and the recent merger has been frequently discussed at annual meetings for almost nine years before the era of chairman Runge ended in 2013.
In the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20DFB-Pokal">2007–08 DFB-Pokal</a> (German Cup) tournament, Wuppertaler SV reached the Round of 16 after beating <a href="Erzgebirge%20Aue">Erzgebirge Aue</a> (4–3 on penalties) and <a href="Hertha%20BSC%20Berlin">Hertha BSC Berlin</a> (2–0). They were put out by eventual cup winners <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> (2–5). Because of the small capacity of <a href="Stadion%20am%20Zoo">Stadion am Zoo</a>, the match was played at <a href="Arena%20AufSchalke">Arena AufSchalke</a> in <a href="Gelsenkirchen">Gelsenkirchen</a>.
The era after chairman Runge.
At an annual meeting on 24 May 2013 the club's name returned to Wuppertaler SV. A new administrative board was formed by the 13 members of Initiative WSV 2.0 of which Alexander Eichner was a member of. President Klaus Mathies resigned from this position to allow a smooth transition and for Eichner to take over. At a <a href="news%20conference">news conference</a> on 4 June 2013 it was announced that the club was bankrupt, which resulted in an enforced relegation. Wuppertaler SV played in the fifth division, the <a href="Oberliga%20Niederrhein">Oberliga Niederrhein</a>, until 2015–16 when a league championship took the club back up to the Regionalliga.

The club was founded on 22 May 1898 as FC Olympia Darmstadt. Early in 1919, the association was briefly known as "Rasen-Sportverein Olympia" before merging with Darmstädter Sport Club 1905 on 11 November that year to become Sportverein Darmstadt 98. Merger partner SC was the product of a 1905 union between Viktoria 1900 Darmstadt and Germania 1903 Darmstadt. The footballers are today part of a sports club which also offers its over 13,500 members <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, <a href="hiking">hiking</a>, <a href="futsal">futsal</a>, <a href="judo">judo</a>, and <a href="table%20tennis">table tennis</a>.
The football department competed in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons after a 33-year run in lower leagues. In 2023, Darmstadt 98 is part of the Bundesliga again.
History.
Early history.
 Olympia played as a lower table side in the Westkreisliga between 1909 and 1913. In the late 20s and early 30s the club played as SV Darmstadt in the <a href="Kreisliga%20Odenwald">Kreisliga Odenwald</a> and <a href="Bezirksliga%20Main-Hessen">Bezirksliga Main-Hessen</a>, Gruppe Hesse, but struggled to stay in top flight competition. In 1933, German football was reorganized under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> into sixteen premier divisions known as Gauligen. Darmstadt was not able to break into upper league play until 1941 when they joined the <a href="Gauliga%20Hessen-Nassau">Gauliga Hessen-Nassau</a>, Gruppe 2. Their stay was short-lived and they were relegated after their second season of play at that level. By 1944–45 the division had collapsed in the face of the advance of Allied armies into Germany.
Darmstadt enjoyed a long run as a second division team through the 50s and then again from the time of the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 1963 on into the 70s. However, they were never better than a lower to mid-table side until a breakthrough happened in 1973 with a <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> championship and participation in the promotion rounds for the Bundesliga, where they finished a distant second to <a href="Rot-Weiss%20Essen">Rot-Weiss Essen</a>.
From the Bundesliga to insolvency.
A side with limited resources, Darmstadt eventually managed two seasons in the Bundesliga (1978–79 and 1981–82). They narrowly missed a third turn in the top league in 1988 when they lost in a lengthy relegation-promotion play-off to <a href="SV%20Waldhof%20Mannheim">Waldhof Mannheim</a> in a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a> of the third match between the two clubs. In the following years, Darmstadt 98 escaped relegation to the Amateur <a href="Oberliga%20Hessen">Oberliga Hessen</a> (III) in 1991 when Essen was refused a <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> licence for financial reasons. However, by 1997, SV had themselves become victims of financial mismanagement, slipping to the third and fourth divisions.
The team's most recent successes include wins in the Hessen Pokal (Hessen Cup) in 1999, 2001, 2006, 2007 and 2008, as well as three consecutive Possmann-Hessen Cup wins from 2000 to 2002. In the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, Darmstadt advanced as far as the third round in 1989 and 2001, and to the quarter-finals in 1986. In 2004, the club won the Oberliga Hessen (IV) championship under manager and former player <a href="Bruno%20Labbadia">Bruno Labbadia</a>, and were promoted to the Regionalliga Süd (III).
Financial problems limited their options and they were relegated to the Oberliga Hessen (IV) at the end of the 2006–07 season. The club's stated aim was to reach the new <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> within five years. However, on 6 March 2008, Darmstadt entered <a href="insolvency">insolvency</a> proceedings, with debts of around <a href="Euro">€</a>1.1 million making the future of the club uncertain. After the 2007–08 Oberliga Hessen Championship, Darmstadt played in the Regionalliga Süd. Darmstadt took various measures to avert <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>, for example a friendly benefit match against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, donations etc. In addition, the former management of the club (e.g. former president, former tax advisor) made vital financial contributions which secured the club's future.
Rise to the Bundesliga.
After winning the 2010–11 Regionalliga Süd in dramatic fashion, Darmstadt were promoted to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>. In 2012, <a href="Dirk%20Schuster">Dirk Schuster</a> was appointed as head coach, and he signed Darmstadt's future captain, <a href="Ayta%C3%A7%20Sulu">Aytaç Sulu</a>. In the 2012–13 season, the club was initially relegated but their fiercest rivals <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a> were refused a 3. Liga licence due to going into administration and were relegated to the Regionalliga instead. Darmstadt 98 took Offenbach's place.
In 2013–14, having finished third in league and thus gaining entry into the promotion-relegation play-offs, Darmstadt defeated <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a> in the second leg through away goals after losing 1–3 in the first leg at home to secure promotion to <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> for the first time in 21 years in dramatic circumstances.
In the following <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%202.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga season</a>, Darmstadt secured the second-place position in the league and therefore promotion to the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> after a 33-year absence. In their final league match, against <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a>, the club won 1–0 at home through a 70th minute free-kick by <a href="Tobias%20Kempe">Tobias Kempe</a>. This was a second consecutive promotion for the team, led again by coach Schuster and captain Sulu.
Darmstadt reached the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20DFB-Pokal%23Round%20of%2016">Round of 16 of the 2015–16 DFB Pokal</a>. On 8 March 2016, long-term fan Jonathan Heimes died of cancer and, posthumously, Darmstadt's stadium was renamed as "Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion am Böllenfalltor" for the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Bundesliga">2016–17 season</a>. Darmstadt finished the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16 season</a> in 14th position, mainly due to a positive away record.
Coach Dirk Schuster announced his decision to join <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a>, whereas <a href="Norbert%20Meier">Norbert Meier</a> was appointed as head coach for the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Bundesliga">2016–17 season</a>. After being defeated in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20DFB-Pokal%23Round%202">second round of the 2016–17 DFB Pokal</a> and only scoring 8 points in 12 games, Maier was sacked on 5 December 2016. On 27 December 2016, former Bundesliga player and <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> assistant manager <a href="Torsten%20Frings">Torsten Frings</a> was presented as new head coach. However, the team was incapable of securing the next season in the Bundesliga after a 0–1 defeat to Bayern Munich in the 32nd matchday of the season, and was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga.
After a poor start to the 2017–18-second Bundesliga season, Torsten Frings was removed from his position, and, on 11 December 2017, the vacant manager's position was again filled by Dirk Schuster, who returned to the Darmstadt club for his second spell as manager. He finished 10th in the league.
In the 2018–19 2. Bundesliga season, <a href="Dimitrios%20Grammozis">Dimitrios Grammozis</a> replaced Schuster after 23 points out of 22 games, going on to finish 10th. In the following season, the club finished 5th. After the season, <a href="Markus%20Anfang">Markus Anfang</a> took over as head coach.
In the 2022–23 2. Bundesliga season, Darmstardt secured automatic promotion to the Bundesliga by beating 1. FC Magdeburg 1–0 at home.

FC 08 Homburg

Fußball-Club 08 Homburg or simply FC Homburg is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> based in <a href="Homburg%2C%20Saarland">Homburg, Saarland</a>, that competes in the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga Südwest</a>.
History.
The club was founded on 15 June 1908 as "Fussball Club Homburg" by a group of seventeen young men at the local Hohenburg pub.
In February 1913 they were renamed "Fussballverein Homburg" and went on to take the local championship that season. By the mid-1920s the side was playing second-division football, but folded on 27 August 1936. A new multi-sport club known as "VfL Homburg" was formed 5 March 1937 out of a group of local sides that included "Turnverein 1878 Homburg", "Schwimmverein Homburg", "Kraftsportverein Homburg", "Boxclub Homburg", "Tennis-Club Homburg", as well as the former membership of the defunct "FV". The footballers again took up play in second-tier competition and failed in two attempts (1938, 1941) to win their way through the regional promotion playoff to the first division Gauliga Südwest.
After World War II, Allied occupation authorities dissolved all types of associations in Germany, including football clubs. The club was soon re-constituted as "Sportverein Homburg" and won a division championship in the Amateurliga Saarland (III) in 1948 before resuming the name "FC Homburg" in January 1949.
The Saarland was <a href="Allied%20Occupation%20Zones%20in%20Germany">occupied by the French</a> who made various efforts to see the state become independent of Germany or join France. In sport this was manifested as separate 1952 Olympic and <a href="Football%20World%20Cup%201954%20%28qualification%29">1954 World Cup</a> teams for Saarland, the establishment of a short-lived football league for the state, and the German club "<a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a>" playing in the French second division. "Homburg" played in the Saarland Ehrenliga from 1949 to 1951 as "FC Homburg-Saar". By the time of the 1951–52 season the return of German teams to the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> had been negotiated: the Ehrenliga faded away and by 1956 the independent Saarland Fussball Bund had re-joined the DFB.
A second Amateurliga Saarland title in 1957 advanced "FC" to the 2. Liga-Südwest (II) and in December of that year they adopted the name "FC 08 Homburg/Saar". The club was relegated to the Amateurliga in 1960 which had become a fourth-tier circuit by 1963.
In the late 1970s, the team advanced to the quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal on two occasions, and, on into the early 1980s, moved frequently between third- and fourth-tier play. Then, in the second half of the decade, they enjoyed their greatest success. They played their way back to the second division and on into the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 1986. "Homburg" played two seasons there, were relegated, and returned for one final Bundesliga season in 1989–90 before beginning a gradual descent which would lead them to <a href="Fu%C3%9Fball-Oberliga%20Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar">Oberliga Südwest</a> (IV) where they play today.
The club had a moment of glory in 1991 when it beat <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">FC Bayern Munich</a> in Munich 4–2 after extra time in the first round of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20DFB-Pokal">1991–92 DFB-Pokal</a>. They were relegated from the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> after the 1994–95 season.
Along the way the club had a couple of misadventures. In 1988, the DFB prohibited the team from wearing the sponsorship logo of a condom manufacturer on ethical and moral grounds. In 1998, they entered into an agreement with <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a> to loan players to that team to help ease "Homburg"'s financial pinch. Despite this, in 1999, the club had a brush with bankruptcy that led to their being denied a license to play in the Regionalliga West/Südwest (III) and demotion to the Oberliga Südwest (IV). The club qualified for the 2006–07 German Cup, exiting in the first round 1–2 to Bundesliga side "<a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a>". "Homburg" was finally promoted to <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> after finishing atop the <a href="Fu%C3%9Fball-Oberliga%20Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar">Oberliga Südwest</a> ahead of "<a href="FK%20Pirmasens">FK Pirmasens</a>" on a goal differential of plus 2 in the 2009–10 season. Their Regionalliga cameo ended with a 17th place finish and a return to fifth tier play. "Homburg" immediately bounced back by winning the Oberliga Südwest title and qualifying for the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga Südwest</a> (IV) for 2012–13.

Stuttgarter Kickers

Stuttgarter Kickers is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> that plays in <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>, founded on 21 September 1899 as FC Stuttgarter Cickers.
History.
In its early years the club had a decent local squad that played in the <a href="S%C3%BCdkreis-Liga">Südkreis-Liga</a>, <a href="Kreisliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kreisliga Württemberg</a> and then in the <a href="Bezirksliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Bezirksliga Württemberg</a>. With the reorganization of German football during the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> in 1933, the team – now known as SV Stuttgarter Kickers – found itself in the <a href="Gauliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Gauliga Württemberg</a>, one of sixteen top tier regional leagues established in the country during that time. It continued to have good results locally, but was unable to impress beyond its own area. In the final year of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> the Kickers fielded a combined wartime squad with Sportfreunde Stuttgart.
After the war the club resumed play in the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Süd</a> and performed as a mid-table team early on. By 1950 it had slipped to the lower half of the table with a seemingly solid grip in 14th place, constantly struggling to avoid relegation throughout the decade. Kickers spent the early 60s in <a href="2.%20Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd">tier II football</a>, but after the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional league, in 1963, the club was moved to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>. In 1974, that league went professional and became the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. Between 1963 and the late 1980s the team had varying results, but finally stabilized in the upper half of the standings toward the end of that period. It has one losing appearance to its credit in the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> in 1987 and in 1988–89 it made it to the Bundesliga for the first time. It ended a run of 28 years as a second division outfit. The team was immediately relegated after a 17th-place finish, but continued to deliver some of its best performances. "Die Blauen" advanced to the semi-finals of the 2000 DFB-Pokal and then had a second turn in the Bundesliga in 1991–92, but with the same result as its earlier time up. Over the next decade the club played largely in the second division, before slipping to the Regionalliga Süd (III) in 2001, where they remained until 2008, when a tenth-place finish narrowly qualified them for the new <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>. They finished last (20th) in the 3. Liga in 2008–09 and were relegated to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>. After three seasons at Regionalliga level, the Kickers returned to the 3. Liga in 2012 where they played for four seasons until relegation at the end of 2015–16, now dropping down to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga Südwest</a>. In 2018 they were relegated once more to the <a href="Oberliga%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Oberliga Baden-Württemberg</a>.

SpVgg Greuther Fürth

Spielvereinigung Greuther Fürth (), commonly known as Greuther Fürth (), is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German football club</a> based in <a href="F%C3%BCrth">Fürth</a>, Bavaria. They play in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, the second tier of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>, following relegation from the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Bundesliga">2021–22 season</a>.
Founded in 1903, the most successful era for Greuther Fürth came in the pre-Bundesliga era in the 1910s and 1920s, when the club won three <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">German championships</a>, in <a href="1914%20German%20football%20championship">1914</a>, <a href="1926%20German%20football%20championship">1926</a>, and <a href="1929%20German%20football%20championship">1929</a> respectively, and finished as runners-up in <a href="1920%20German%20football%20championship">1920</a>. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13 season</a>, the club played in the Bundesliga for the first time, having won promotion from the 2. Bundesliga; it was relegated back to the 2. Bundesliga at the end of the season. On 23 May 2021, they were promoted back to the Bundesliga for the second time. Upon placing 18th in the Bundesliga table in the 2021–22 season, they were relegated back to 2. Bundesliga.
History.
Spielvereinigung Fürth.
The origins of "SpVgg Fürth" are in the establishment on 23 September 1903 of a football department within the gymnastics club "<a href="TV%201860%20F%C3%BCrth">Turnverein 1860 Fürth</a>". The footballers went their own way as an independent club in November 1906, after they did not get enough support from "TV Fürth". The team played in the Ostkreisliga and took divisional titles there in 1912, 1913 and 1914 before moving on to participate in the Süddeutsche (South German) regional playoffs for the national championship round. Right from the beginning, there was a great rivalry between the SpVgg Fürth and the <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>, predicated on the historical rivalry between the two neighbouring cities. The club grew rapidly, and by 1914, it had 3,000 members and was the largest sports club in Germany. When the club built their own stadium, <a href="Sportpark%20Ronhof%20Thomas%20Sommer">Sportpark Ronhof</a>, in 1910, it was the biggest stadium in Germany at the time.
National champions.
Fürth won their first national title, the <a href="1914%20German%20football%20championship">1914 German football championship</a>, under English coach <a href="William%20Townley">William Townley</a> with <a href="Midfielder%23Winger">left winger</a> <a href="Julius%20Hirsch">Julius Hirsch</a>, who had joined the team the prior season. They faced <a href="VfB%20Leipzig">VfB Leipzig</a> – the defending champions with three titles to their credit – in the final held on 31 May in <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a>. A 154-minute-long thriller, the longest completed game in German football history (the 1922 Final was abandoned after 189 minutes due to darkness), ended with Fürth scoring a <a href="golden%20goal">golden goal</a> to secure the title.
The team had a solid run of successes through the 1920s and into the early 1930s, beginning with an appearance in the national final in 1920 against 1. FC Nürnberg, which was the dominant side of the decade. The rivalry between the two clubs was such that a star player with SpVgg was forced to leave after he married a woman from the city of <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>. In 1924, for the first and only time, the Germany national side was made up exclusively of players from just two sides – Fürth and 1. FC Nürnberg – and players of the two teams slept in separate rail coaches.
SpVgg showed regularly on the national stage, advancing to the semi-finals in 1923 and 1931. They claimed two more championships – in 1926 and 1929 – with both of those victories coming at the expense of <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>. Through this period, the club played five finals in the Süddeutscher Pokal (en:South German Cup), coming away as cup winners on four occasions. On 27 August 1929, the association was joined by "FC Schneidig Fürth".
German football was re-organized in 1933 under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> into 16 top flight <a href="Gauliga">Gauligen</a>. Fürth became part of the <a href="Gauliga%20Bayern">Gauliga Bayern</a>, but their success over the next dozen seasons was limited to a division title there in 1935, alongside regular appearances in competition for the Tschammerpokal, predecessor to today's <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> (German Cup).
Postwar play.
After the war, the team struggled through three seasons in the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Süd</a> (I) before slipping to the <a href="Landesliga%20Bayern">Landesliga Bayern</a> (II). "SpVgg" quickly recovered itself and returned to Oberliga play the next season. They won the title there in 1950 and went on to the national playoffs, advancing as far as the semi-finals before being eliminated 1–4 by <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>. In 1954, two players from the "SpVgg", <a href="Karl%20Mai">Karl Mai</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Erhardt">Herbert Erhardt</a>, were members of the "<a href="Miracle%20of%20Bern">Miracle of Bern</a>" team that won Germany's first <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a>.
Fürth remained a first division side until the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963. The club did not qualify as one of the sixteen teams that made up the new unified national first division and they found themselves playing second division football in the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>, where they were generally a mid-table side whose best finish was third-place result in 1967. The club played in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> from its inception in 1974 until 1983 with their best performance a fourth-place result in 1978–79. They slipped to playing in the tier III <a href="Bayernliga">Bayernliga</a>, with a short three-year spell in the fourth division <a href="Landesliga%20Bayern-Mitte">Landesliga Bayern-Mitte</a> in the late 1980s. At this time, the club started to have large financial problems. In 1990, Fürth celebrated a 3–1 victory in the opening round of the DFB-Pokal play <a href="List%20of%20Bundesliga%20clubs%20eliminated%20from%20the%20DFB-Pokal%20by%20amateur%20sides">over first division side</a> <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> before going out 0–1 to <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a> in the second round. They returned to the Bayernliga (III) in 1991 and the Regionalliga Süd (III) in 1994. But still, the club's financial issues became bigger, and they were forced to sell their ground to the local businessman <a href="Conny%20Brandst%C3%A4tter">Conny Brandstätter</a>. As the financial problems continued to grow, the president of "SpVgg", Edgar Burkhart, arranged a deal with Helmut Hack, president of <a href="TSV%20Vestenbergsgreuth">TSV Vestenbergsgreuth</a>, to let "TSV" join the "SpVgg" and changing the name of the "Spielvereinigung" to the name "SpVgg Greuther Fürth", which is still in use. The "SpVgg" so had the chance to get back in both financial and on-pitch success, while "TSV" could grow bigger in the city of Fürth than it would have been possible in the village of <a href="Vestenbergsgreuth">Vestenbergsgreuth</a>.
TSV Vestenbergsgreuth.
Meanwhile, the small village team of "TSV Vestenbergsgreuth" was established 1 February 1974 and debuted as a fourth division side. They advanced into the Amateur Oberliga Bayern (III) in 1987, just as SpVgg Fürth was descending to play in the division the more junior club had just escaped. "TSV" took part in the national amateur playoff round in 1988 and 1995. Their best performance came in the 1995 DFB-Pokal when they upset <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 1–0, and then beat <a href="FC%2008%20Homburg">FC 08 Homburg</a> 5–1, before being eliminated in the third round of the competition by <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> on penalty kicks.
SpVgg Greuther Fürth.
At the time when Vestenbergsgreuth's football branch was incorporated in 1996, in which TSV's football players came over to Fürth, both clubs were playing at about the same level in Regionalliga Süd (III). The SpVgg was runner-up behind long-term rival 1. FC Nürnberg in the division the next year, and so earned promotion back to the 2. Bundesliga after 18 years, and played in the second tier at the first time since 1979. At this time, the "Sportpark Ronhof", now called "Playmobil Arena", faced the first major redevelopment since the post-war years and the construction of the old main stand in 1950. They built new stands on three of the four sides of the pitch, a roofed seating stand on the opposite side of the main stand, an uncovered terrace in the north end, and an uncovered mixed standing and seating area in the south of the stadium, as well as installing <a href="floodlights">floodlights</a> in the "Ronhof" the first time ever. With the modernized stadium and a clever transfer strategy, they have consistently finished in the top half of the 18-team table in the 2000s, despite having one of the lowest budgets most of the time. On 1 July 2003, the club added former workers' club "<a href="Tuspo%20F%C3%BCrth">Tuspo Fürth</a>" to its tradition through a merger. In 2008, the stadium faced another redevelopment, as the standing terrace in the north got a roof, and a VIP building was installed near to the old main stand. With this work, the main stand became the last piece of the stadium that has not been redeveloped. In that time, Fürth has come close to renewing its ancient rivalry with Nürnberg at the Bundesliga level, narrowly missing promotion in each of the first two seasons of the 2010s. On 23 April 2012, Fürth finally gained promotion to the Bundesliga in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%202.%20Bundesliga">2011–12 season</a>, eventually winning the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> under manager <a href="Mike%20B%C3%BCskens">Mike Büskens</a>. With promotion, the 1998-built south stand was demolished, and a new one was installed, gaining a capacity increase from 14,500 to 18,000, as well as providing a roof on the south for the first time.
However, Fürth had a difficult first season in the Bundesliga as the club amassed only four victories in the 34-game campaign, one of them at the ground of their rivals 1. FC Nürnberg, when the de facto relegated side won 1–0, giving the fans of the "Kleeblatt" a peaceful feeling about the relegation. The club also set an infamous record by becoming the first club in Bundesliga history to not win a single home game during the regular season. The club finished last in the league with 21 points and was relegated back to the 2. Bundesliga.
The following season, despite not aiming for promotion, the club was a strong contender for a direct return to the Bundesliga. A third place in the final standings qualified the team for the promotion play-offs, where it faced <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>. After a 0–0 draw in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, the club missed out on promotion on the away goal rule when the return leg ended 1–1. In the following seasons, they struggled to be as strong as they were before the Bundesliga promotion. They nearly got relegated to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%202.%20Bundesliga">2014–15 season</a>, when only a narrow win against later promoted club <a href="SV%20Darmstadt%2098">SV Darmstadt 98</a> on matchday 33, and other teams not winning on matchday 34, kept them in the league. In the same season, on early matchday 2, they gained a historic 5–1 home victory in the <a href="Frankenderby">Frankenderby</a>, their highest-ever home win in a derby. In the following two years, the "Spielvereinigung" finished mid-table, with not having either fear of getting relegated or gaining promotion. This period of their newer history is characterized by the relegation of "FCN" in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bundesliga">2014</a>, and both rivals playing each year since then. In the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%202.%20Bundesliga">2016–17 season</a>, the "Kleeblatt" won both derbies of the regular season for the first time since the 1970s, and finished above Nuremberg for the first time since the 1950s. In early 2016, the 1950-built main stand was demolished, and the construction of a new main stand started. Before the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%202.%20Bundesliga">2017–18 season</a>, the construction of the new main stand was finished. With a 3–1 victory over <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a> on 17 September 2017, the club became leader of the all-time league table of the 2. Bundesliga.
By finishing second in the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%202.%20Bundesliga">2020–21 season</a>, Greuther Fürth gained promotion to the Bundesliga for the second time in the club's history. Under manager <a href="Stefan%20Leitl">Stefan Leitl</a>, the team secured promotion on the last matchday of the season with a 3–2 victory over Fortuna Düsseldorf.
SpVgg Greuther Fürth II.
Fürth also fields a strong reserve side which has played in the Oberliga Bayern (IV) since the 2001–02 season and finished second there in 2006–07. A second place in 2007–08 meant the team was qualified to play in the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> in 2008–09.
Rivals.
1. FC Nürnberg is by far the SpVgg's biggest rival, going back to the early days of German football when, at times, those two clubs dominated the national championship. Matches between both teams also called as "Frankenderby". Minor rivals include <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. Both competed against each other again in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13 Bundesliga season</a> and the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%202.%20Bundesliga">2014–15 2.

He had promised to attend a game at the Ronhof stadium if the team were promoted to the top-flight Bundesliga. As a child, Kissinger had tried to watch games there, despite it being against his parents' wishes.

FC Ingolstadt 04

Fußball-Club Ingolstadt 2004 e.V., commonly known as FC Ingolstadt 04 or FC Ingolstadt, is a German <a href="Association%20football">football</a> <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Germany">club</a> based in <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a>, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. The club was founded in 2004 out of the merger of the football sides of two other clubs: <a href="ESV%20Ingolstadt">ESV Ingolstadt-Ringsee 1919</a> and <a href="MTV%20Ingolstadt">MTV Ingolstadt 1881</a>.
History.
ESV Ingolstadt.
ESV Ingolstadt (Eisenbahner-Sportverein Ingolstadt-Ringsee e.V.) was founded in 1919 as FC Viktoria. Two years later the football players of Turnverein 1861 Ingolstadt joined the club to form VfR Ingolstadt. A number of other clubs from the Ringsee district fused with this club, but to little effect. The club's achievement amounted to not more than a couple of seasons spent in the <a href="Gauliga%20Bayern">Gauliga Bayern</a> in 1936–38. After World War II, the club was re-constituted as VfR Ingolstadt, changed its name to Erster Sportverein Ingolstadt (First Sports Club Ingolstadt) in 1951 and then changed it again to its current form in 1953 when "E" came to stand for Eisenbahner to reflect its affiliation with the railway.
ESV Ingolstadt joined the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> (II) in 1963 when the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> – Germany's professional football league – was formed. After bouncing between tiers II and III, capped with two seasons spent in <a href="2.%20Bundesliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281974%E2%80%931981%29">2. Bundesliga Süd</a> from 1979 to 1981, the club began a descent through tier III to <a href="Landesliga%20Bayern-S%C3%BCd">Landesliga Bayern-Süd</a> (IV), last playing in 1993–94. The sports club itself carried on until it went bankrupt in the summer of 2004 and those football players there were left to join FC Ingolstadt 04. ESV continues to operate today offering a number of other sports activities while acknowledging FC 04 on its website.
MTV Ingolstadt.
MTV Ingolstadt (Männer-Turn-Verein von 1881 Ingolstadt) is the city's largest sportsclub with 3,400 members and has an on-and-off relationship with its football side. The club was founded in 1881 and took up football in 1905. The footballers set up a separate club in 1924, but returned to the fold in 1933 at the direction of sports authorities in the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>. After World War II occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations in Germany, including sporting associations. The club was re-founded as Städtischer SV Ingolstadt 1881. Their original name was restored in 1948.
MTV spent two seasons in 2. Bundesliga Süd after <a href="Oberliga%20Bayern">Amateurliga Bayern</a> champion <a href="1.%20FC%20Ha%C3%9Ffurt">1. FC Haßfurt</a> declined promotion in 1978. When ESV faced bankruptcy in 2004, MTV allowed its footballers to leave to help form FC Ingolstadt.
Current.
Newly formed FC Ingolstadt began play in the Oberliga Bayern (IV) and managed to finish second in their first season In 2004–05. Their success continued in 2005–06 when they captured the divisional title and won promotion. They finished their debut Regionalliga Süd (III) campaign 2006–07 with a fifth-place result. League restructuring was planned for the 2008–09 season with the introduction of a national third division and FC would have to finish their 2007–08 Regionalliga season in the top 10 to qualify. They exceeded that goal by finishing second and advancing to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>.
Ingolstadt won its debut second division match, but the following months proved less successful for the club and by the mid-winter break they had dropped to 12th place. The latter half of the season proved even worse with the club only realizing 1 win in 18 matches. They finished the season in 17th place and were subsequently relegated to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>.
FC delivered a steady performance in third division play and ended their campaign in third place. A new promotion/relegation format accompanied the introduction of the 3. Liga and the club's finish earned them a play-off versus <a href="F.C.%20Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a> which had finished in 16th (third last) place in the 2. Bundesliga. Ingolstadt won both legs of the two match play-off and returned to the second division alongside the top two third tier teams which advanced automatically by virtue of their finishes.
On 17 May 2015, they clinched the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%202.%20Bundesliga">2014–15 2. Bundesliga</a> title and won promotion for the first time in their history to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. Ingolstadt finished 11th in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16 Bundesliga</a>, but the following year they fell to 17th and were relegated back to the 2. Bundesliga.
In the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%202.%20Bundesliga">2018–19 2. Bundesliga</a>, Ingolstadt finished 16th and lost the relegation playoff against <a href="SV%20Wehen%20Wiesbaden">SV Wehen Wiesbaden</a> on away goals.
In the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%203.%20Liga">2019–20 3. Liga</a> qualified for the promotion playoffs, but suffered more heartbreak, as a last second goal from <a href="Fabian%20Schleusener">Fabian Schleusener</a> saw Ingolstadt lose to <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">FC Nürnberg</a> on away goals.
In the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%203.%20Liga">2020–21 3. Liga</a>, Ingolstadt were once again part of the relegation playoffs, and a 3–0 win over <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a> in the first leg gave them the advantage heading into the second leg. Despite a 3–1 loss in the second leg, Ingolstadt won 4–3 on aggregate, and won promotion to the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%202.%20Bundesliga">2021–22 2. Bundesliga</a>. The club were relegated back to the 3. Liga on the 31st matchday after a 2–2 draw against Karlsruhe.

They have also received plaudits for generally adhering to an attacking footballing philosophy.
History.
Foundation and early years.
The club was founded on 19 December 1909 by a group of young men unhappy with the Catholic church-sponsored "Trinity Youth", where they played football under the stern and unsympathetic eye of the local parish priest. The priest, Father Dewald was blocked at the door when he tried to break up the organising meeting being held in a room of the local pub, "Zum Wildschütz". The founders were Franz and Paul Braun, Henry Cleve, Hans Debest, Paul Dziendzielle, Franz, Julius and Wilhelm Jacobi, Hans Kahn, Gustav Müller, Franz Risse, Fritz Schulte, Hans Siebold, August Tönnesmann, Heinrich and Robert Unger, Fritz Weber and Franz Wendt. The name "Borussia" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> but was taken from Borussia beer from the nearby Borussia brewery in Dortmund. The team began playing in blue and white striped shirts with a red sash, and black shorts. In 1913, they donned the black and yellow stripes for the first time.
Over the next decades the club had only modest success playing in local leagues. They had a brush with bankruptcy in 1929 when an attempt to boost the club's fortunes by signing some paid professional footballers failed miserably and left the team deep in debt. They survived only through the generosity of a local supporter who covered the team's shortfall out of his own pocket.
The 1930s saw the rise of the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>, which restructured sports and football organisations throughout the nation to suit the regime's goals. "Borussia"'s president was replaced when he refused to join the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>, and a couple of members who surreptitiously used the club's offices to produce anti-Nazi pamphlets were executed in the last days of the war. The club did have greater success in the newly established <a href="Gauliga%20Westfalen">Gauliga Westfalen</a>, but would have to wait until after the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> to make a breakthrough. It was during this time that Borussia developed its intense rivalry with <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> of suburban <a href="Gelsenkirchen">Gelsenkirchen</a>, the most successful side of the era (see "<a href="Revierderby">Revierderby</a>"). Like every other organisation in Germany, Borussia was dissolved by the Allied occupation authorities after the war in an attempt to distance the country's institutions from its recent Nazi past. There was a short-lived attempt to merge the club with two others – "Werksportgemeinschaft Hoesch" and "Freier Sportverein 98" – as "Sportgemeinschaft Borussia von 1898", but it was as "Ballspiel-Verein Borussia" ("BVB") that they made their first appearance in the national league final in 1949, where they lost 2–3 to <a href="VfR%20Mannheim">VfR Mannheim</a>.
First national titles.
Between 1946 and 1963, Borussia featured in the <a href="Oberliga%20West%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga West</a>, a first division league which dominated German football through the late 1950s. In <a href="1949%20German%20football%20championship">1949</a>, Borussia reached the <a href="1949%20German%20football%20championship%23Final">final</a> in <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> against <a href="VfR%20Mannheim">VfR Mannheim</a>, which they lost 2–3 after extra time. The club claimed its first national title in <a href="1956%20German%20football%20championship">1956</a> with a 4–2 win against <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a>. One year later, Borussia defeated <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> 4–1 to win their <a href="1957%20German%20football%20championship">second national title</a>. After this coup, the three Alfredos (<a href="Alfred%20Prei%C3%9Fler">Alfred Preißler</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Kelbassa">Alfred Kelbassa</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Niepieklo">Alfred Niepieklo</a>) were legends in Dortmund. In <a href="1963%20German%20football%20championship">1963</a>, Borussia won the last edition of the <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions%23German%20football%20championships%20Postwar%20to%20the%20Bundesliga%20%281946%E2%80%9363%29">German Football Championship</a> (before the introduction of the new <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>) to secure their third national title.
Bundesliga debut.
In 1962, the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">DFB</a> met in Dortmund and voted to establish a professional football league in Germany, to begin play in August 1963 as the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. Borussia Dortmund earned its place among the first sixteen clubs to play in the league by winning the last pre-Bundesliga national championship. Runners-up <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> also earned an automatic berth. Dortmund's <a href="Friedhelm%20Konietzka">Friedhelm Konietzka</a> scored the first-ever Bundesliga goal a minute into the match, which they would eventually lose 2–3 to <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>.
In <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20DFB-Pokal">1965</a>, Dortmund won its first <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. In 1966, Dortmund won the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> 2–1 against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in extra time, with the goals coming from <a href="Sigfried%20Held">Sigfried Held</a> and <a href="Reinhard%20Libuda">Reinhard Libuda</a>. In the same year, however, the team surrendered a commanding position atop the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> by losing four of their last five league games and finishing second, three points behind champions <a href="TSV%201860%20M%C3%BCnchen">1860 München</a>. Ironically, much of 1860 München's success came on the strength of the play of Konietzka, recently transferred from Dortmund.
The 1970s were characterised by financial problems, relegation from the Bundesliga in 1972, and the opening of the <a href="Westfalenstadion">Westfalenstadion</a>, named after its home region <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a> in 1974. The club returned to the Bundesliga in 1976.
Dortmund continued to have financial problems through the 1980s. "BVB" avoided being relegated in 1986 by winning a third decisive playoff game against <a href="SC%20Fortuna%20K%C3%B6ln">Fortuna Köln</a> after finishing the regular season in 16th place. Dortmund did not enjoy any significant success again until a 4–1 DFB-Pokal win in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20DFB-Pokal">1989</a> against Werder Bremen. It was <a href="Horst%20K%C3%B6ppel">Horst Köppel</a>'s first trophy as a manager. Dortmund then won the <a href="1989%20DFB-Supercup">1989 DFL-Supercup</a> 4–3 against rivals <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>.
Golden age – the 1990s.
After a tenth-place finish in the Bundesliga in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Bundesliga">1991</a>, manager <a href="Horst%20K%C3%B6ppel">Horst Köppel</a> was sacked and manager <a href="Ottmar%20Hitzfeld">Ottmar Hitzfeld</a> was hired.
In <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Bundesliga">1992</a>, Hitzfeld led Borussia Dortmund to a second-place finish in the Bundesliga, and would have won the title had <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> not won their last game to become champions instead.
Along with a fourth-place finish in the Bundesliga, Dortmund made it to the 1993 <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> <a href="1993%20UEFA%20Cup%20final">final</a>, which they lost 6–1 on aggregate to <a href="Juventus%20FC">Juventus</a>. In spite of this result, Borussia walked away with <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">DM</a>25 million under the prize money pool system in place at the time for German sides participating in the Cup. Cash flush, Dortmund was able to sign players who later brought them numerous honours in the 1990s.
Under the <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captaincy</a> of 1996 <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or">European Footballer of the Year</a> <a href="Matthias%20Sammer">Matthias Sammer</a>, Borussia Dortmund won back-to-back Bundesliga titles in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Bundesliga">1995</a> and <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Bundesliga">1996</a>. Dortmund also won the <a href="DFL-Supercup">DFL-Supercup</a> against <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Mönchengladbach</a> in <a href="1995%20DFB-Supercup">1995</a> and <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> in <a href="1996%20DFB-Supercup">1996</a>.
In <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1996–97</a> the team reached its first <a href="List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals">European Cup final</a>. In a memorable <a href="1997%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">match</a> at the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Munich%29">Olympiastadion</a> in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, Dortmund faced the holders Juventus. <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Riedle">Karl-Heinz Riedle</a> put Dortmund ahead, shooting under goalkeeper <a href="Angelo%20Peruzzi">Angelo Peruzzi</a> from a cross by <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a>. Riedle then made it two with a bullet header from a corner kick. In the second half, <a href="Alessandro%20Del%20Piero">Alessandro Del Piero</a> pulled one back for Juventus with a back heel. Then 20-year-old substitute and Dortmund-born <a href="Lars%20Ricken">Lars Ricken</a> latched onto a through pass by <a href="Andreas%20M%C3%B6ller">Andreas Möller</a>. Only 16 seconds after coming on to the pitch, Ricken chipped Peruzzi in the Juventus goal from over 20 yards out with his first touch of the ball. With <a href="Zinedine%20Zidane">Zinedine Zidane</a> unable to make an impression for Juventus against the close marking of Lambert, Dortmund lifted the trophy with a 3–1 victory.
Dortmund then beat Brazilian club <a href="Cruzeiro%20Esporte%20Clube">Cruzeiro</a> 2–0 in the <a href="1997%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1997 Intercontinental Cup</a> final to become world club champions. Borussia Dortmund were the second German club to win the Intercontinental Cup, after Bayern Munich in <a href="1976%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1976</a>.
As defending champions, Dortmund reached the Champions League semi-final in 1998. The team was missing key players from the start of the season when they played <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> in the 1998 semi-final. Sammer's career was shortened by injury and only played three first team games after the 1997 Champions League win. Lambert had left in November to return to play in Scotland. Möller missed the first leg as did Kohler who missed both games in the tie. Real won the first leg 2–0 at home. Dortmund played better in the second leg, but did not take their chances. The club exited 2–0 on aggregate.
21st century and Borussia "goes public".
In October 2000, Borussia Dortmund became the first publicly traded club on the German stock market.
In <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Bundesliga">2002</a>, Borussia Dortmund won their third Bundesliga title. Dortmund had a remarkable run at the end of the season to overtake <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a>, securing the title on the final day. Manager <a href="Matthias%20Sammer">Matthias Sammer</a> became the first person in Borussia Dortmund history to win the Bundesliga as both a player and manager. In the same season, Borussia lost the <a href="2002%20UEFA%20Cup%20final">final</a> of the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Cup">2001–02 UEFA Cup</a> to the Dutch club <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a>.
Dortmund's fortunes then steadily declined for several years. Poor financial management led to a heavy debt load and the sale of their Westfalenstadion grounds. The situation was compounded by failure to advance in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2003–04 UEFA Champions League</a>, when the team was eliminated on penalties in the qualifying rounds by <a href="Club%20Brugge%20KV">Club Brugge</a>. In 2003, Bayern Munich loaned €2 million to Dortmund for several months to pay their payroll. Borussia was again driven to the brink of <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> in 2005, the original €11 value of its shares having plummeted by over 80% on the <a href="Frankfurt%20Stock%20Exchange">Frankfurt Stock Exchange</a>.
At this time <a href="Hans-Joachim%20Watzke">Hans-Joachim Watzke</a> was appointed CEO and streamlined the club. The response to the crisis included a 20% pay cut for all players. In 2006, in order to reduce debt, the <a href="Westfalenstadion">Westfalenstadion</a> was renamed "Signal Iduna Park" after a local insurance company. The naming rights agreement runs until 2021.
Dortmund suffered a miserable start to the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06</a> season, but rallied to finish seventh. The club was unable gain a place in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> via the Fair Play draw. The club's management indicated that the club again showed a profit; this was largely related to the sale of <a href="David%20Odonkor">David Odonkor</a> to <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> and <a href="Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Rosick%C3%BD">Tomáš Rosický</a> to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>.
In the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07</a> season, Dortmund unexpectedly faced serious <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a> trouble for the first time in years. Dortmund went through three coaches, and appointed <a href="Thomas%20Doll">Thomas Doll</a> on 13 March 2007, after dropping to just one point above the relegation zone. <a href="Christoph%20Metzelder">Christoph Metzelder</a> also left Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer.
In the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Bundesliga">2007–08</a> season, Dortmund finished 13th in the Bundesliga table, but reached the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> final against Bayern Munich, where they lost 2–1 in extra time. The final appearance qualified Dortmund for the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, because Bayern had already qualified for the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>. Thomas Doll resigned on 19 May 2008 and was replaced by <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a>.
Klopp era and return to prominence.
In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Bundesliga">2009–10</a> season, Klopp's Dortmund improved on the season before, finishing fifth in the Bundesliga to qualify for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>. The team missed an opportunity to qualify for the Champions League when they did not beat eighth-place <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> and 14th-place <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a> in the final two matches of the campaign.
Entering the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11</a> season, Dortmund fielded a young and vibrant roster. On 4 December 2010, Borussia became "<a href="Herbstmeister">Herbstmeister</a>" ("Autumn Champion"), an unofficial accolade going to the league leader at the winter break. They did this three matches before the break, sharing the record for having achieved this earliest with <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> (1993–94) and 1. FC Kaiserslautern (1997–98). On 30 April 2011, the club beat <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> 2–0 at home, while second-place Bayer Leverkusen lost, leaving Dortmund eight points clear with two games to play. This championship equalled the seven national titles held by rivals Schalke 04, and guaranteed a spot in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2011–12 Champions League</a> group stages.
One year later, Dortmund successfully defended of its Bundesliga title with a win over <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, again on the 32nd match day. By the 34th and final match day, Dortmund had set a new record with the most points—81—gained by a club in one Bundesliga season. This was surpassed the following season by Bayern Munich's 91 points. The club's fifth Bundesliga title and eighth German championship overall placed it third in <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions%23Total%20German%20football%20championships%20won">total national titles</a>, allowing the club to wear <a href="Verdiente%20Meistervereine">two stars</a> above its crest in recognition of the team's five Bundesliga titles. The club capped its successful 2011–12 season by winning the <a href="double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> for the first time, beating Bayern 5–2 in the <a href="2012%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">final</a> of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. Borussia Dortmund are one of four German clubs to win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a>, along with Bayern Munich, <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1.

Borussia Dortmund ended the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Borussia%20Dortmund%20season">2012–13 season</a> in second place in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. Dortmund played in their second <a href="2013%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">UEFA Champions League final</a> against Bayern Munich in the first ever all-German club final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> on 25 May 2013, which they lost 2–1.
In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Borussia%20Dortmund%20season">2013–14 season</a>, Borussia Dortmund won the <a href="2013%20DFL-Supercup">2013 DFL-Supercup</a> 4–2 against rivals Bayern Munich. The 2013–14 season started with a five-game winning streak for Dortmund, their best start to a season. Despite a promising start, however, their season was hampered by injuries to several key players, seeing them stoop as low as fourth place in the table, and with a depleted squad could go only as far as the quarter-finals of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, losing 3–2 on aggregate to Real Madrid. Nevertheless, Dortmund ended their season on a high note by finishing second in the Bundesliga and reaching the <a href="2014%20DFB-Pokal%20final">2014 DFB-Pokal final</a>, losing 0–2 to Bayern in extra time. They then began their <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15 season</a> by defeating Bayern in the <a href="2014%20DFL-Supercup">2014 DFL-Supercup</a> 2–0. However, this victory did not affect the squad's solidity in performance at the start of the ensuing season, with Dortmund recording various results such as a 0–1 loss to <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> and two 2–2 draws against <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> and Bundesliga newcomers <a href="SC%20Paderborn%2007">Paderborn 07</a>. During the winter, Dortmund fell to the bottom of the table on multiple occasions, but escaped the relegation zone after four consecutive wins in February. On 15 April 2015, Jürgen Klopp announced that after seven years, he would be leaving Dortmund. Four days later, Dortmund announced that <a href="Thomas%20Tuchel">Thomas Tuchel</a> would replace Klopp at the end of the season. Klopp's final season, however, ended on high note, rising and finishing seventh after facing relegation, gaining a DFB-Pokal final with VfL Wolfsburg and qualifying for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2015–16 Europa League</a>.
Post-Klopp era.
In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Borussia%20Dortmund%20season%23Results%20summary">2015–16 season</a>, Dortmund started off on a high, winning 4–0 against <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> on the opening day, followed by five-straight wins which took them to the top of the Bundesliga. After the eighth matchday, they were surpassed by Bayern Munich following an unlucky draw with <a href="TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim">1899 Hoffenheim</a>. Dortmund kept their performances up, winning 24 out of 34 league games and becoming the best Bundesliga runner-up team of all time. In the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>, they advanced to the quarter-finals, getting knocked out by a Jürgen Klopp-led <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in a dramatic comeback at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>, where defender <a href="Dejan%20Lovren">Dejan Lovren</a> scored a late goal to make it 4–3 to Liverpool and 5–4 on aggregate. In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20DFB-Pokal">2015–16 DFB-Pokal</a>, for the third-straight year, Dortmund made it to the competition <a href="2016%20DFB-Pokal%20final">final</a>, but lost to Bayern Munich on penalties.
On 11 April 2017, <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund%20team%20bus%20bombing">three explosions occurred near the team's bus</a> on its way to a <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> match against <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">AS Monaco</a> at the <a href="Westfalenstadion">Signal Iduna Park</a>. Defender <a href="Marc%20Bartra">Marc Bartra</a> was injured, and taken to hospital. Dortmund lost the game 2–3 to AS Monaco. Dortmund manager Tuchel blamed the loss on the ignorant decision by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>. UEFA said that the team made no objection to playing, and that the decision was made in compliance with the club and local law enforcement. In the second leg, Dortmund lost 1–3, leaving the aggregate score at 3–6, causing them to be eliminated from that year's UEFA Champions League. On 26 April, Dortmund defeated <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 3–2 in Munich to advance to the <a href="2017%20DFB-Pokal%20final">2017 DFB-Pokal final</a>, Dortmund's fourth consecutive final and fifth in six seasons. On 27 May, Dortmund won the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20DFB-Pokal">2016–17 DFB-Pokal</a> 2–1 over <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> with the winner coming from a penalty converted by <a href="Pierre-Emerick%20Aubameyang">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a>.
Ahead of the 2017–18 season, Thomas Tuchel stepped down as manager. The Dortmund board made a decision to hire <a href="Peter%20Bosz">Peter Bosz</a> as the new manager and head coach. Although Bosz got off to a record-breaking start in the team's first 7 games, what followed was 20 games without a win, after which he was relieved of his staff role. <a href="Peter%20St%C3%B6ger">Peter Stöger</a> was announced as the interim coach. During the January window of the same season, Aubameyang and Bartra both left the club. Stöger bought <a href="Manuel%20Akanji">Manuel Akanji</a> of <a href="FC%20Basel">FC Basel</a> for a fee of €21.5 million and <a href="Michy%20Batshuayi">Michy Batshuayi</a> on a six-month loan from <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. Stöger coached Dortmund for the rest of the season, granting them a fourth-place finish in the Bundesliga before stepping down at the end of the season.
In the summer of 2018, Dortmund appointed former <a href="OGC%20Nice">OGC Nice</a> coach, <a href="Lucien%20Favre">Lucien Favre</a> as their manager/head coach. After a very busy transfer window for the team, seeing eight new players arrive at the club for the first team squad, Dortmund performed strongly, chasing <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> for the title race down to the last matchday, narrowly missing out on the league title by two points and earning Lucien Favre a contract extension. A four-part <a href="Amazon%20Prime%20Video">Amazon Prime Video</a> documentary series was created, about the same season, named "Inside Borussia Dortmund".
The next season, Dortmund pulled off a few big-name signings with the intent of winning the Bundesliga title. Although they won the DFL Supercup, this was their only silverware of the season. After a scrappy first half of the season, they changed their tactics and made a few more transfers in the January Window. They were eliminated in both the DFB-Pokal and the UEFA Champions League as well. Due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Germany">COVID-19 pandemic in Germany</a>, the season stopped abruptly. Once the season restarted, Dortmund looked better, but their performances were not enough to stop a dominant Bayern Munich side from grasping the Bundesliga title. They finished the 2019–20 season in second place after beating <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> in matchweek 33 due to a brace from <a href="Erling%20Haaland">Erling Haaland</a>.
Dortmund got off to a rather shaky start in the 2020–21 season. They lost the DFL-Supercup and had an inconsistent set of results in the Champions League and the Bundesliga. After a humiliating 5–1 defeat to Stuttgart in Matchday 11, Lucien Favre was relieved of his managerial duties. Assistant manager <a href="Edin%20Terzi%C4%87%20%28footballer%29">Edin Terzić</a> was placed as the caretaker for the rest of the season. Under Terzić, Dortmund finished third on the final matchday of the Bundesliga and was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in a clash against Manchester City. The team then won the DFB-Pokal, <a href="2021%20DFB-Pokal%20final">defeating RB Leipzig 4–1 in the final</a>. Marco Rose was appointed manager for the 2021–22 season, with Terzić being appointed as the club's new technical director. Terzić was later reappointed as manager ahead of the 2022–23 season. Before the final matchday of that season, Dortmund were top of the league table, though they later lost the Bundesliga title on goal difference to Bayern Munich after a disappointing 2–2 home draw against Mainz.
Grounds.
Stadiums.
The Westfalenstadion is the home stadium of Borussia Dortmund, Germany's largest stadium and the seventh-largest in Europe. The stadium was named "Signal Iduna Park" after insurance company <a href="Signal%20Iduna">Signal Iduna</a> purchased the rights to name the stadium until 2021. This name, however, could not be used when hosting <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> and <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners. During the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a>, the stadium was referred to as "FIFA World Cup Stadium, Dortmund", while in UEFA club matches, it is known as "BVB Stadion Dortmund". The stadium currently hosts up to 81,359 spectators (standing and seated) for league matches and 65,829 seated spectators for international matches. For these, the characteristic southern grandstand is re-equipped with seats to conform to FIFA regulations.
In 1974, the Westfalenstadion replaced the <a href="Stadion%20Rote%20Erde">Stadion Rote Erde</a>, which is located next door and serves now as the stadium of <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund%20II">Borussia Dortmund II</a>. After the increasing popularity of Borussia Dortmund in the 1960s, it became obvious that the traditional ground was too small for the increasing number of Borussia Dortmund supporters. The city of Dortmund, however, was not able to finance a new stadium and federal institutions were unwilling to help. But in 1971, Dortmund was selected to replace the city of <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, which was forced to withdraw its plans to host games in the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 World Cup</a>. The funds originally set aside for the projected stadium in Cologne were thus re-allocated to Dortmund, and a new stadium became reality.
The Westfalenstadion has undergone several renovations throughout the years to increase the size of the stadium, including an expansion of the stadium for the 2006 World Cup. In 2008, the "Borusseum", a museum about Borussia Dortmund, opened in the stadium. In 2011, Borussia Dortmund agreed to a partnership with <a href="Q-Cells">Q-Cells</a>. The company installed 8,768 <a href="solar%20cell">solar cell</a>s on the roof of the Westfalenstadion to generate up to 860,000 <a href="Kilowatt%20hour">kWh</a> per year.
Borussia Dortmund has the highest average attendance of any <a href="Football%20club%20%28association%20football%29">football club</a> worldwide. In 2014, it was estimated that each of the club's home games was attended by around 1,000 British spectators, drawn to the team by its low ticket prices compared to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>.

KFC Uerdingen 05

KFC Uerdingen 05 is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German football club</a> in the <a href="Uerdingen">Uerdingen</a> district of the city of <a href="Krefeld">Krefeld</a>, <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>. The former <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> side enjoyed its greatest successes in the 1980s but now plays in the fifth-level <a href="Oberliga%20%28football%29">Oberliga</a>.
History.
The club was founded on 17 November 1905 as Fußball-Club Uerdingen 05. On 1 August 1919, following World War I, FC was joined by Sportvereinigung des Realgymnasiums Uerdingen. During World War II from 1941 to 1945 the club played as part of the combined wartime side Kriegspiel-Gemeinschaft KSG Uerdingen alongside VfB 1910 Uerdingen (which was known from 1910 to 1919 as Sport-Club Preussen Uerdingen). That partnership continued after the war with the two clubs playing as Spielvereinigung Uerdingen 05. On 20 February 1948, VfB became independent again and in 1950 SpVgg resumed their original identity as FC Uerdingen 05.
In 1953, the club merged with the Werkssportgruppen Bayer AG Uerdingen, the local worker's sports club of the chemical giant <a href="Bayer">Bayer AG</a>, becoming FC Bayer 05 Uerdingen. Bayer withdrew its sponsorship of the football team in 1995 at which time the club took on the name Krefelder Fußball-Club Uerdingen 05. Bayer continues to support the non-footballing departments of the club as Sport-Club Bayer 05 Uerdingen.
Uerdingen played in the amateur local leagues throughout their early history. By the early 1960s they had advanced as far as the <a href="Amateurliga%20Niederrhein">Amateurliga Niederrhein</a> (III) where they would play until 1971 when they stepped up into the <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> (II). The club then enjoyed a succession of strong finishes: a second-place result in 1974–75 earned them promotion to the top flight <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, where they finished dead last. After three seasons in the second tier <a href="2.%20Bundesliga%20Nord%20%281974%E2%80%9381%29">2. Bundesliga Nord</a>, another second-place finish returned Uerdingen to the Bundesliga in 1979, this time for a two-year stay. The club would go on to enjoy its most successful years through the 1980s. They returned to the Bundesliga in 1983 and earned a best-ever third-place result there in 1986. Uerdingen also captured the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> (German Cup) in 1985 with a 2–1 victory over Bundesliga champions <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>'s <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a>.
Legendary in the club's history from this time is their victory over <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden">Dynamo Dresden</a> in the quarter-finals of the 1986 <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%20Cup">European Cup Winners Cup</a>. Down 2–0 after the first leg away and behind 3–1 by half-time at home in the return leg, Uerdingen came storming back with six unanswered goals to win 7–3.
In 1987, Uerdingen also became the first club to win both the German <a href="Under%2019%20Bundesliga">under 19's</a> and <a href="Under%2017%20Bundesliga">under 17's</a> championship in the same season.
The team spent the first half of the 1990s as an "elevator crew" bouncing up and down between the Bundesliga and <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. After the 1995 season Bayer withdrew its sponsorship of the football team which has suffered chronic financial difficulties ever since. Uerdingen took up their final year of play in the Bundesliga in the 1995–96 season as Krefelder Fußball-Club Uerdingen 05. By the turn of the millennium they had slipped through the second division and into third division play. The club's persistent financial problems led the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">DFB</a> to deny them a license for play in the Regionalliga Nord (III) in 2003 despite a mid-table finish and they were relegated to the <a href="Oberliga%20Nordrhein">Oberliga Nordrhein</a> (IV).
Veteran manager and <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a> legend <a href="Aleksandar%20Risti%C4%87">Aleksandar Ristić</a> was put in charge of the team as German football was reorganised with the introduction the new <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> in 2008–09. KFC attempted to qualify for the restructured Regionalliga (IV), but failed in its attempt and was instead relegated to the Verbandsliga (VI) after finishing 13th.
In 2009, KFC has struggled with financial difficulties and its efforts to raise money included auctioning on eBay the right to coach the squad for one match and inviting childhood fan <a href="Pete%20Doherty">Pete Doherty</a> to a league match.
In 2010–11, the club won the Verbandsliga and thus gained promotion to the <a href="NRW-Liga">NRW-Liga</a> (V). It was the first promotion in 17 years. KFC finished 8th NRW-Liga and missed second consecutive promotion to <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> due to finishing behind <a href="VfB%20H%C3%BCls">VfB Hüls</a>. After the disbanding of the NRW-Liga, KFC qualified for the <a href="Oberliga%20Niederrhein">Oberliga Niederrhein</a>. It won a league championship at this level in 2013 and was promoted to the <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> but relegated back to the Oberliga again in 2015.
In 2017, Uerdingen won promotion to <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> and in 2018 after winning the playoff against <a href="Waldhof%20Mannheim">Waldhof Mannheim</a> won promotion to <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>.
In January 2021, outgoing president <a href="Mikhail%20Ponomarev">Mikhail Ponomarev</a> and his deputy Nicolas Weinhardt announced their departure from the club and shortly after, stated that due to financial losses caused mainly by the <a href="impact%20of%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic%20on%20association%20football">impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on association football</a> and an unclear situation regarding the stadium in <a href="Krefeld">Krefeld</a>, it had filed for <a href="insolvency">insolvency</a>. On 10 February 2021 the club was bought by Armenian business man and owner of the Noah Company, <a href="Roman%20Gevorkyan">Roman Gevorkyan</a>, who was also the owner of Armenian <a href="FC%20Noah">FC Noah</a>, Latvian <a href="FC%20Noah%20J%C5%ABrmala">FC Noah Jūrmala</a> and Italian <a href="A.C.N.%20Siena%201904">A.C.N. Siena 1904</a>.
In June 2021, due to financial insolvency, and the inability to meet the licensing requirements of the 3. Liga, KFC Uerdingen was relegated to the Regionalliga West. This led to Gevorkyan and the Noah Company withdrawing their engagements in the club, and all players were released by the club. In the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Regionalliga">2021–22 season</a>, Uerdingen suffered a second consecutive relegation, and were relegated to the <a href="Oberliga%20%28football%29">Oberliga</a>.

SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin

SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin was a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German football club</a> based in the Berlin district of <a href="Neuk%C3%B6lln">Neukölln</a>.
History.
The club was founded as "Rixdorfer TuFC Tasmania 1900" on 2 June 1900. It is believed the founders of the club were about to migrate to <a href="Australia">Australia</a> at the end of the 19th century, so they named their club after their shared desired destination <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>.
In 1965, Berlin's only <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> side, <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>, had its license revoked and was <a href="relegated">relegated</a> for breaking the league's player salary rules. The <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> wanted to keep a club in the city of Berlin for political reasons and this led to one of the strangest episodes in the Bundesliga's history.
Both <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a> and <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">FC Schalke 04</a> tried to avoid being demoted by laying claim to Hertha's place. It was decided to suspend relegation for one season and increase the number of teams in the league from 16 to 18 to accommodate the two teams which would normally be promoted from the Regionalligen, the Regional Leagues being the leagues below the Bundesliga at the time. <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> politics led to a space being held for a team from the former capital city to replace Hertha.
The winner of <a href="Regionalliga%20Berlin">Regionalliga Berlin</a>, <a href="Tennis%20Borussia%20Berlin">Tennis Borussia Berlin</a>, had failed to advance to the Bundesliga through the regular promotion round that saw <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> move up. After the Regionalliga second-place finisher, <a href="Spandauer%20SV">Spandauer SV</a>, refused an offer of promotion, the way was clear for third-place club "Tasmania 1900" to take up the opportunity to represent Berlin in the Bundesliga — just two weeks before the start of the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Bundesliga">1965–66 season</a>.
A top performer in the relatively weak Regionalliga Berlin, "Tasmania" would find themselves seriously overmatched in the Bundesliga. Despite a season-opening 2–0 win over "Karlsruher SC" at the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a>, they would go on to become the worst team in league history — in a 34-game season they won only twice. They scored only 15 goals while conceding 108 and finished the season in last place earning just 8 of a possible 68 points. The only team not to beat "Tasmania" was <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> which managed only two draws (0–0 and 1–1) against them. The 0–0 result at Betzenberg was the only point earned by "Tasmania" away from their home stadium.
"Tasmania" were relegated at the end of the season and returned to the Regionalliga Berlin. Although the team made it to the promotion round twice between 1966 and 1973, they never managed a return to the Bundesliga. In 1973, the Neukölln sports association declared bankruptcy.
SV Tasmania Berlin.
A successor team, "SC Tasmania 73 Neukölln" was created, becoming "SV Tasmania-Gropiusstadt 1973" in 2000. While the new club's first team had to restart in the lowest division in 1973 and quickly rose through the ranks again, their youth teams were permitted to remain in the leagues they played in under the old name. Since 2011, the club has been known as <a href="SV%20Tasmania%20Berlin">SV Tasmania Berlin</a>.

SV Waldhof Mannheim is a <a href="multi-sports%20club">multi-sports club</a>, located in <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a>, <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>. It is most known for its <a href="association%20football">association football</a> team; however, there are also professional <a href="team%20handball">handball</a> and <a href="table-tennis">table-tennis</a> sides. The club today has a membership of over 2,400.
History.
The club was founded 1907 and played in the second division of the "<a href="Westkreis-Liga">Westkreis-Liga</a>" before the First World War. "Waldhof" became part of the <a href="Kreisliga%20Odenwald">Kreisliga Odenwald</a> in 1919 and won this league in 1920 and 1921. In each of those seasons, the club failed to advance in the <a href="Southern%20German%20championship">Southern German championship</a> because it was grouped with all-powerful <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> at the time. The club took a <a href="Bezirksliga%20Rhein">Bezirksliga Rhein</a> championship in 1924 before joining the <a href="Bezirksliga%20Rhein-Saar">Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar</a> in 1927, where it won five out of the next six division titles without ever performing particularly well in the Southern championship.
Its enjoyed its best performances in the <a href="Gauliga%20Baden">Gauliga Baden</a>, one of sixteen top-flight divisions established through the 1933 re-organization of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>. "Waldhof" dominated the division through the 1930s and into the early 1940s, capturing the title five times. They were unable, however, to translate that into success at the national level. Their best result came in 1940 when they went out in a semi-final against "<a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">FC Schalke 04</a>", the dominant side of the era, before settling for fourth place after losing a consolation round match to "<a href="SK%20Rapid%20Wien">Rapid Vienna</a>".
After World War II, "Waldhof" competed in the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Süd</a>, where they earned mid-table results until being relegated to the <a href="2nd%20Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd">2nd Oberliga Süd</a> in 1954. They bounced up and down between first and second division play until the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional football league, in 1963. The next season saw them in the tier II <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> alongside local rivals "<a href="VfR%20Mannheim">VfR Mannheim</a>". A string of unimpressive results finally led to relegation to the <a href="Amateurliga%20Nordbaden">Amateurliga Nordbaden</a> (III) in 1970.
Support from a new sponsor, the snack chip maker <a href="Chio">Chio</a>, revived the team and helped their return to the second division where they played as "SV Chio Waldhof Mannheim" from 1972 to 1978. They continued to play as a middling side there until they broke through to the Bundesliga in 1983. "Waldhof" spent seven seasons in the top flight until a 17th-place finish saw the club relegated at the end of the 1989–90 season. They played for seven seasons as a <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> club until slipping to the Regionalliga Süd for two seasons in 1997–99. A merger with "<a href="VfR%20Mannheim">VfR Mannheim</a>" was considered in 1998 but the club walked away from a deal at the last minute. Their return to the 2. Bundesliga in 1999 after a season-long struggle with "<a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a>" was cut short in 2003 when financial irregularities saw the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> deny the team a licence, dropping them to the <a href="Oberliga%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Oberliga Baden-Württemberg</a> (IV). Another attempt at a merger with "VfR" failed that same year. The club played in the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg until 2007–08, when a third-place finish allowed them to qualify for the <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a>.
After coming fourth in the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> in 2008–09, the club moved to the <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> in 2009–10 to balance out the three Regionalligas.
Waldhof again had their licence withdrawn in 2010 and were demoted back to the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg, now the fifth level of German football, despite having finished clear of the relegation zone with the league's smallest budget. Waldhof spent only one year in the Oberliga, winning the league in 2010–11 and advancing directly back to the Regionalliga. On 11 June 2011 they defeated <a href="FV%20Illertissen">FV Illertissen</a> 6–0 in their final league match to clinch promotion and also set a new fifth division attendance record of 18,312. It surpassed the previous record, the 2009 Leipzig derby, by more than 3,000 spectators.
At the end of the 2011–12, season the club was grouped into the new <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga Südwest</a>, which replaced the Regionalliga Süd in the region. Waldhof won the league in 2015–16 but lost to <a href="Sportfreunde%20Lotte">Sportfreunde Lotte</a> in the promotion round. They also lost promotion play-offs in the following two seasons after finishing second in the Regionalliga Südwest, to <a href="SV%20Meppen">Meppen</a> on penalties in 2017 and to <a href="KFC%20Uerdingen%2005">KFC Uerdingen</a> in 2018 after crowd disturbances caused the second leg to be abandoned while Waldhof were losing 3–1 on aggregate. In the 2018–19 season, the team secured the Regionalliga Südwest championship and direct promotion to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> on the 30th matchday with a 1–0 home win over <a href="Wormatia%20Worms">Wormatia Worms</a>.
Reserve team.
The "SV Waldhof II", historically also referred to as "SV Waldhof Amateure", rose to the tier-IV league <a href="Verbandsliga%20Nordbaden">Verbandsliga Nordbaden</a> in 1986 and remained there until gaining promotion to the Oberliga Baden-Württemberg in 2001. After two seasons in the Oberliga with good results, the team had to be withdrawn due to the forced relegation of the first team. In the 2007–08 season, the team narrowly missed out on Verbandsliga promotion when it finished second on equal points to the <a href="SV%20Sandhausen%20II">SV Sandhausen II</a>.

FC Augsburg

Fußball-Club Augsburg 1907 e. V., commonly known as FC Augsburg () or Augsburg, is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German professional football club</a> based in <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. FC Augsburg play in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, the top tier of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>. The team was founded as Fußball-Klub Alemania Augsburg in 1907 and played as <a href="BC%20Augsburg">BC Augsburg</a> from 1921 to 1969. With over 18,800 members, it is the largest <a href="Football%20team">football club</a> in <a href="Swabia%20%28Bavaria%29">Swabian Bavaria</a>.
The club has spent most of its history fluctuating between the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">second</a> and <a href="3.%20Liga">third divisions</a>, with disappointment striking in the early 2000s when Augsburg were relegated to the fourth division for two seasons. However, the club experienced a surge following this setback, and was eventually promoted to the Bundesliga for the first time in 2011, where it has remained ever since. Augsburg have consolidated their Bundesliga status in the 2010s, finishing a record high fifth in the 2014–15 season before several mid-table finishes, and made their European debut in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2015–16 UEFA Europa League</a>, with the club reaching the Round of 32 before being knocked out by <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> 1–0 on aggregate.
Since 2009, FC Augsburg's stadium has been the 30,660 capacity <a href="Augsburg%20Arena">WWK ARENA</a>, located south of Augsburg city centre and easily accessible via tram. The club, known as the Fuggerstädter or simply as FCA, receive strong home support with an average attendance of 28,709 in the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bundesliga">2019–20 Bundesliga</a> season (93.6% of stadium capacity). It is a single tier stadium with a standing terrace behind one of the goals, known as the Ulrich-Biesinger-Tribüne, and three seated stands with a standing section in the opposite corner to the Ulrich-Biesinger-Tribüne for away fans.
Augsburg maintains fierce local rivalries with <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">Ingolstadt</a> and <a href="FC%20Augsburg%E2%80%93TSV%201860%20Munich%20rivalry">TSV 1860 Munich</a>. Matches between these clubs typically attract large crowds, and a match in 1973 at 1860 Munich set the all-time spectator record for the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Munich%29">Olympic Stadium</a>. FCA regularly sell out their local Bavarian derby against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>.
The club's colours are red, green and white which can be found across the club's kits while the club badge is similar to the Augsburg city emblem. The club's training facilities are situated next to the stadium while a club shop is located near <a href="Augsburg%20Hauptbahnhof">Augsburg Hauptbahnhof</a> in the city centre.
History.
Formation.
A merger of Augsburg's two most successful clubs, <a href="TSV%20Schwaben%20Augsburg">TSV Schwaben</a> and <a href="BC%20Augsburg">BC Augsburg</a>, was discussed as early as the late 1940s, but distrust between the two sides and a fear that the other club would dominate the merger caused each side to hesitate, despite the financial trouble both clubs were in. A first serious meeting between the two sides was held in 1964, both clubs having dropped out of <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">tier-one football</a> by then. The leadership of the multi-sports club Schwaben was completely behind a merger, but the club's football department was not, and once more the process of forming FCA was stalled. Traditionally, BCA saw itself as a working-class club, based in the north of Augsburg, while Schwaben was the club of the more affluent and based south of the city, with the river <a href="Wertach%20%28river%29">Wertach</a> forming something of a boundary between the two clubs territories.
In 1968, with BCA struggling in the third division after relegation from professional football the year before and Schwaben soon to follow, another effort was made. In April 1969, a high-level meeting between the two club bosses brought the decision to merge the clubs and name the new side FC Augsburg. FCA was to be a football club only, with no other sports department. The then-mayor of Augsburg, Hans Breuer, was one of the driving forces behind the move.
The merger came at a time of on-the-field decline for both sides, Schwaben had just been relegated from the tier-two <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> and decided that an attempt to regain their status was financially impossible, while BCA narrowly missed out on promotion to the league that season. In June, 256 of 265 of BCA's members present voted for the merger while, shortly after, 75 percent of Schwaben's members also approved the motion.
Schwaben, however, opted for the "small solution"—the club was to remain independent with only its football department merging into the new club. But even this move was not universally popular within the club, with some former members forming a new football club, Eintracht Augsburg, and restarting from the lowest level of the pyramid. For this reason, FCA is generally not considered to carry on the traditions of TSV Schwaben, only those of BC Augsburg. A year later, the footballers of Eintracht rejoined Schwaben but, since then, have always remained an amateur club. It took the new football department until 1981 to regain its third-division status, where they were to meet FCA for the first time in league football and renewed the Augsburg derby.
The new FCA played its first game on 30 July 1969, when it met <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> in Augsburg in front of 13,000, losing 0–3 in extra time.
Early years: 1969 to 1974.
After the formation of the club in 1969, the side was to spend most of its time in tier-two and three leagues, the <a href="Bayernliga">Bayernliga</a>, Regionalliga Süd and the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. The new side, despite now concentrating Augsburg's football forces, was no instant success. A fourth-place finish in the league and dwindling supporter numbers proved that the new merger side had not yet been accepted in the city. The following season, FCA finished one place better in the league but, with an average support of 300 spectators per game, the club found it difficult to retain its top players. The 1971–72 season saw further decline, an eighth-place finish, but from there the team improved, winning the league the following year and returning professional football to the town. By then, the club had found acceptance in the town and, in the final game of the season, 15,000 spectators had turned up to celebrate the Bayernliga championship.
The 1973–74 season saw the return of one of Augsburg's greatest football talents to the city, and the FCA—former German international <a href="Helmut%20Haller">Helmut Haller</a> had returned to the club after 11 years in Italy playing for <a href="Bologna%20F.C.%201909">Bologna</a> and <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>. FCA paid DM 44,000 for the transfer of Haller.
FCA became an instant success in the Regionalliga, drawing an average crowd of over 22,000 for its home matches. When the club traveled to Munich to meet <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">1860 Munich</a> in the then-new <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Munich%29">Olympic Stadium</a>, 80,000 flocked to the game, starting what remains today as a <a href="FC%20Augsburg%20and%20TSV%201860%20M%C3%BCnchen%20rivalry">fierce rivalry</a> between the two clubs. FCA dominated the season, eventually winning the league title as a freshly promoted team. The mood in Augsburg was one of excitement, and the newspapers spoke of the atmosphere in the stadium as of "Augsburg, the <a href="Naples">Napoli</a> of Germany."
Augsburg qualified for the promotion round for the Bundesliga through its league title, where it met four other teams to determine the one available spot in the first division. FCA gave away easy points at home, drawing three times in four games. Away, the team lost only once, against <a href="Rot-Wei%C3%9F%20Oberhausen">Rot-Weiß Oberhausen</a>, but nevertheless came only second, one point behind <a href="Tennis%20Borussia%20Berlin">Tennis Borussia Berlin</a>, who earned promotion. Nevertheless, FCA had qualified for the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga%20South%20%281974%E2%80%9381%29">southern division</a> of the new <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> through its league title.
Stagnation: 1974 to 1983.
The success of 1973–74 was quickly replaced with relegation trouble in the new 2. Bundesliga. The next five seasons saw lower table finishes, the temporary departure of Helmut Haller and frequent replacements of managers. By 1978–79, the club was unable to avoid relegation, despite Haller, at the age of 40, once more taking to the field for FCA for a last time. The club, after six seasons in the second division, returned to the Bayernliga.
FCA was able to break the fall and win the Bavarian league title to gain promotion back to the 2. Bundesliga straight away in 1979–80. On top of this, the team qualified for the <a href="German%20amateur%20football%20championship">German amateur football championship</a>, where it advanced to the final before losing to <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>'s reserve side. But the club's promotion back to the second level faced a major obstacle. The 2. Bundesliga, after 1981, was to operate in a single division and with half as many clubs as before, meaning the club had to fulfill the qualifying norm, not an easy task for a freshly promoted side. FCA finished 18th in 1980–81, not enough to hold the league in a normal season and definitely not enough in 1981.
The club once more won the Bavarian league on its first attempt, defeating Schwaben in the first two Augsburg league derbies since 1968, but now had to enter a promotion round to determine the two teams that would go up out of the four Southern German league champions. FCA came second behind <a href="FSV%20Frankfurt">FSV Frankfurt</a> and returned to the 2. Bundesliga once more, despite some of the gate receipts already being processed during the game against <a href="FC%2008%20Homburg">FC 08 Homburg</a> by the tax department due to outstanding debts. However, the side was again not strong enough for this level and was relegated on a slightly worse goal average then 16th-placed <a href="Union%20Solingen">Union Solingen</a>, lacking three goals to salvation. It was to be Augsburg's last season in the second tier for almost a quarter of a century.
Bayernliga: 1983 to 1994.
FCA was to spend the next 11 seasons once more in Bavaria's highest league, the Bayernliga, at the time still the third tier of league football in the state. With the gradual reduction of the number of second divisions from five in 1974 to one in 1981, a number of Bavarian clubs that had once played at higher level had now dropped down to this level, and competition in the league was much stronger than in the past: 1860 Munich, <a href="SpVgg%20Bayreuth">SpVgg Bayreuth</a>, <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">SpVgg Fürth</a>, <a href="SSV%20Jahn%20Regensburg">Jahn Regensburg</a>, <a href="MTV%20Ingolstadt">MTV Ingolstadt</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20Schweinfurt%2005">FC Schweinfurt 05</a> and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Hof">Bayern Hof</a> had all played with Augsburg in the 2. Bundesliga in recent years.
While the club was one of the top sides in the league, another title did not seem to materialise; a second-place finish in 1985 being the best result, one point behind champions SpVgg Bayreuth. Again, the club changed managers frequently but had settled into the Bayernliga for good, it seemed. It was only when <a href="Armin%20Veh">Armin Veh</a> took over the team in 1991 that fortunes for the team seemed to improve, not harmed by the fact 1860 Munich made its "escape" from the league and returned to professional football that year.
In 1993, the club won its one and only national championship to date, when <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> was defeated in the German <a href="Under%2019%20Bundesliga">Under-19 championship final</a>.
In 1994, the club had another try at promotion in the last year of promotion play-offs to the 2. Bundesliga. However, this time the Bavarian champion was not grouped with the other Southern German clubs as in previous years, and thus had to face stronger clubs in the northern group that included <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a> and <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>. Despite being overmatched and unable to advance, they still received strong support in the region with crowds of over 20,000 turning up at the games. While the performance was not enough to gain entry to the 2. Bundesliga, FCA did qualify for the new <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>, which was slotted between the second division and the Bayernliga as the new third tier.
Regionalliga: 1994 to 2000.
Augsburg spent the first four years in the new league as a mid-table side, never getting anywhere near the promotion ranks. The fifth season then saw a decline, with the team only finishing 14th and only two points clear of a relegation spot.
The following year was once more a qualifying season, with the number of Regionalligas being reduced in numbers from four to two. FCA fulfilled the on-the-field requirement, finishing eighth, its best Regionalliga result to that date. Financially, however, the club was in dire straits, with a real possibility of the club folding. While the latter threat was averted, FCA was refused a Regionalliga licence when a potential investor backed out and the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB) relegated it to the Bayernliga, now the fourth tier. Main sponsor Infomatec, which had promised to provide a DM 3 million security for the club with the DFB, was unable to do so and, faced with debts of DM 1.8 million, the club was not in the financial position to obtain a Regionalliga licence.
Recovery: 2000 to 2011.
Financial rescue came in the form of Walther Seinsch, a local entrepreneur, who took over as chairman and introduced sound financial management to the club. The club was able to field a competitive team in the Bayernliga once more and achieved promotion back to the Regionalliga in its second season, in 2002.
The club returned as a force in the third division, earning top-four finishes in all of the next four seasons there. FCA came achingly close to advancing to 2. Bundesliga in 2005, but missed their opportunity after giving up two goals to Jahn Regensburg in the last four minutes of their final game of the season. The club dominated the Regionalliga Süd the next year, winning the league and clinching a berth in the 2. Bundesliga for the 2006–07 season.
This marked their first appearance in the 2. Bundesliga in 23 years. They finished the campaign in seventh place on 52 points, only eight points away from promotion to the top-flight. Once again, the game at 1860 Munich was the highlight, with a 3–0 victory for Augsburg in front of 69,000 in the Allianz Arena. <a href="Ralf%20Loose">Ralf Loose</a> replaced Rainer Hörgl as head coach in October 2007 when the club found itself in the relegation zone. Loose's contract was terminated on 16 April 2008 after a string of bad results. He was replaced with <a href="Holger%20Fach">Holger Fach</a> two days later. The club avoided relegation on goal average, being on equal points with relegated side <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a> at the end of the season.
The longtime home ground of the FCA, Rosenaustadion, built from World War II rubble, finally came to its well-deserved rest in 2009 when a new stadium was completed. The new <a href="Augsburg%20Arena">Augsburg Arena</a> also hosted games of the <a href="2011%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2011 FIFA Women's World Cup</a>.
Under Dutch manager <a href="Jos%20Luhukay">Jos Luhukay</a>, Augsburg enjoyed a successful season in 2009–10, when the club reached the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal as well as finishing third in the 2. Bundesliga, which allowed it to play 1. FC Nürnberg for Bundesliga promotion. In two games there, the "Franconians" kept the upper hand and FCA was condemned to wait another year. However, at the end of the 2010–11 season, FC Augsburg finished second in the league and was promoted to the Bundesliga for the first time in its history.
Bundesliga and Europa League Qualification: 2011 to present.
On 15 October 2011, FCA won its first-ever game in the first division, defeating <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">Mainz 05</a> 1–0. On 28 April 2012, FCA retained their status as a Bundesliga club for a second year with a game to spare. Only a week later, Luhukay resigned from the FCA job, citing doubts with regards to the club's prospects as the reason. On 17 May 2012, the club appointed <a href="Markus%20Weinzierl">Markus Weinzierl</a> as its new manager.
In its second Bundesliga season, FCA struggled even more than in its first year, accumulating only nine points in the first half of the season. However, FCA secured its top-flight survival in the last match of the season against Greuther Fürth with a 3–1 victory.
In <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20FC%20Augsburg%20season">2013–14</a>, FCA finished eighth in the league and competed, unsuccessfully, for an <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> place, rather than struggling against relegation.
FCA began the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20FC%20Augsburg%20season">2014–15 season</a> with a first round DFB-Pokal <a href="List%20of%20Bundesliga%20clubs%20eliminated%20from%20the%20DFB-Pokal%20by%20amateur%20sides">defeat against amateur fourth division side</a> <a href="1.%20FC%20Magdeburg">1. FC Magdeburg</a>.
FCA qualified for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2015–16 Europa League</a> after finishing fifth in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15 Bundesliga</a>, their best ever finish. After a last-gasp 3–1 away win in the last group match at <a href="FK%20Partizan">Partizan</a>, FCA advanced to the knockout stage of the competition for the first time, being drawn against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the round of 32. After a goalless first leg at the <a href="WWK%20ARENA">WWK ARENA</a>, Augsburg fell to a narrow 1–0 defeat to the eventual Europa League runners-up at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>.
On 2 June 2016, Markus Weinzierl left FC Augsburg to become manager at <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, followed by the immediate signing of <a href="Dirk%20Schuster">Dirk Schuster</a> (then-outgoing manager at <a href="SV%20Darmstadt%2098">Darmstadt 98</a>) as his successor. He was subsequently followed by <a href="Manuel%20Baum">Manuel Baum</a> on 14 December 2016. In <a href="2017-18%20Bundesliga">2017–18</a>, he led FCA to the most successful start in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> history of Augsburg. In 2021, American investor <a href="David%20Blitzer">David Blitzer</a> purchased a 45% stake in the club from Klaus Hofmann.

Youth and amateur sides.
Youth.
The historically indifferent performance of the senior side was offset by the success of the club's youth team, which captured a national championship in the Under 18's in 1993, being the last non-Bundesliga club to do so. They also took four Cup titles in the early 1990s, all under the guidance of coach <a href="Heiner%20Schuhmann">Heiner Schuhmann</a>. With Schuhmann's departure for Bayern Munich, the golden age of FCA youth football ended and the club could not quite achieve so highly again. With the formation of the <a href="Under%2019%20Bundesliga">Under 19 Bundesliga</a> (2004) and <a href="Under%2017%20Bundesliga">Under 17 Bundesliga</a> (2007), the club's youth teams slipped to second division status but recovered and, in 2013–14, the youth teams played in the Under 19 Bundesliga and Under 17 Bundesliga, the first tier of youth football in Germany at their respective age levels.
Reserve team.
The club's reserve side had its greatest success before the merger, playing, as BC Augsburg Amateure, for a season in the southern division of the <a href="Bayernliga">Amateurliga Bayern</a> in 1962–63. A sixth place there allowed the side to qualify for the unified Bavarian league the following year, but, along with the decline of the senior team, the reserve side got relegated too, finishing 17th.
The team disappeared into the lower amateur leagues after that, but returned to the <a href="Landesliga%20Bayern-S%C3%BCd">Landesliga Bayern-Süd</a> in 1976, finishing runners-up in the league in its first season, now as FC Augsburg Amateure. By 1978 however, the side was relegated again, not to return to this level for a quarter of a decade. It did, however, take out the <a href="Schwaben%20Cup">Schwaben Cup</a> in 1977, and qualified for the first round of the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20DFB-Pokal">1977–78</a> <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. After away victories over second division side <a href="SV%20Arminia%20Hannover">Arminia Hannover</a> and fellow amateur side <a href="1.%20FC%20Normannia%20Gm%C3%BCnd">1. FC Normannia Gmünd</a> in the first two rounds, the team reached the third round, where it lost 0–4 to <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>.
After becoming a founding member of the <a href="Bezirksoberliga%20Schwaben">Bezirksoberliga Schwaben</a> in 1988, the team was withdrawn at the end of the season, disbanded altogether and not reformed for more than a decade.
Since 2004, the side once more played in the Landesliga Bayern-Süd, generally achieving good results and eventually being promoted to <a href="Regionalliga%20Bayern">Regionalliga Bayern</a> at the end of the 2011–12 season.

Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin

Sp.Vg. Blau-Weiß 1890 Berlin, generally referred to as Blau-Weiß 90, was a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> based in the <a href="Mariendorf">Mariendorf</a> district of Berlin. The club was formed on 27 July 1927 out of the merger of "Berliner FC Vorwärts 1890" (November 1890), German championship runner-up of 1921, and "Berliner Thor- und Fussball Club Union 1892" ("BTuFC Union", June 1892), German champions of 1905. Blau-Weiß 90 spent <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Bundesliga">one season</a> in the German first division, the Bundesliga.
History.
Predecessors.
Predecessor sides "Vorwärts" and "Union" were both <a href="Founding%20Clubs%20of%20the%20DFB">founding members</a> of the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> at <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> in 1900. "Vorwärts" enjoyed early success with local championships in 1902, 1903 and 1921. In that last championship year, they also sent four players to the national side and played in the German final, which they lost 0–5 to <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>. "Union" took the national title in 1905 with a 2–0 win over <a href="Karlsruher%20FV">Karlsruher FV</a>.
Immediately after the 1927 merger of these two sides the club was relegated from top-flight football in the city. The following season a third side, "Arminia 1906 Berlin", joined the newly created club which started to slowly improve returning to the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg (I) in 1931. Within a couple of years German football was re-organised under the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Third Reich</a> into sixteen top-flight divisions with "Blau-Weiss" joining the <a href="Gauliga%20Berlin-Brandenburg">Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg</a>.
World War II and postwar period.
The club was sent down after a last place finish in 1937 but came storming back to win the division title in 1938–39. "Blau-Weiß" captured a second division title in 1942 and finished third overall nationally. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations in the country, including sports and football associations. The club was later re-formed as "SG Mariendorf" which eventually broke up into three separate sides: "SpVgg Blau-Weiß 90 Berlin" (re-established in 1949), "<a href="SV%20Mariendorf">SC Krampe Berlin</a>", and "<a href="SV%20Mariendorf">SC Mariendorf</a>".
SG Mariendorf played first division football from 1946 until being relegated in 1948. Blau-Weiß re-joined the top tier Oberliga Berlin in 1950 where they played as a lower to mid-table side until finally being relegated in 1960. After three seasons in the Amateurliga Berlin (II), which included a division title win in 1963, the club secured a place in the newly formed Regionalliga Berlin (II).
Once again a lower to mid-table side the club's performance improved in the early 1970s leading to a Regionalliga title in 1973 and a failed participation in the promotion rounds for the top-flight <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. League re-organisation at the end of the 1973–74 season led to the breakup of the existing Regionalliga: first placed <a href="Tennis%20Borussia%20Berlin">Tennis Borussia Berlin</a> was promoted to the Bundesliga, runner-up <a href="Berliner%20FC%20Alemannia%201890">Wacker 04 Berlin</a> joined the newly formed second tier <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, while third place Blau-Weiss landed in the Amateurliga Berlin (III).
From Bundesliga to bankruptcy.
A poor finish in 1978 led to the club's relegation and they spent the next handful of seasons bouncing between the third and fourth divisions. "Blau-Weiß"'s return to what was now the <a href="Amateur-Oberliga%20Berlin">Oberliga Berlin</a> (III) in 1984 was accompanied by a division title and their second participation in the promotion rounds for the 2. Bundesliga. This time the club was successful and two seasons later surprised with a second place finish that led to advancement to the top-flight Bundesliga in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%202.%20Bundesliga">1985–86 season</a>. "Blau-Weiß" found itself outmatched in the senior professional circuit and was relegated as the last-placed club at the end of just one season. <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Bundesliga">1986-87 season</a> was first and only Bundesliga season in club history. They spent another five seasons in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> before declaring bankruptcy in 1992.

The financial collapse of the parent club and a 16th-place result in 1992 led to the disappearance of the side from upper-level football.

SC Fortuna Köln

SC Fortuna Köln is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> based in the city of <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>.
History.
The club was formed as on 21 February 1948 through the merger of three local sides: Victoria Köln 1911 (one of two clubs to bear the name), Bayenthaler SV 1920, and Sparkassen-Verein Köln 1927. Of these clubs, Victoria had the best results, winning its way to the first division of the <a href="Gauliga%20K%C3%B6ln-Aachen">Gauliga Köln-Aachen</a> in 1941 and capturing the division title there the following season. Bayenthaler SV 1920 side also spent a season in the <a href="Gauliga">Gauliga</a> in 1943–44 before the division collapsed as war overtook the region. In 1976, SC Fortuna Köln was joined by FC Alter Markt Köln.
Through most of the last four decades Fortuna has played as a second division side. Highlights of the club's history include promotion to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> for the 1974 season and an impressive run through the 1983 <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. The team took out <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a> in the first round and eked out a win on penalties over <a href="SSV%20Ulm%201846">SSV Ulm 1846</a> in their next match. They then eliminated three first division sides in a row: first <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a> and <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, before crushing <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> 5–0 in their semi-final match. This put them into the final against hometown rivals <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>, the first time the Cup final had come down to a local derby. Although they outplayed their opposition, Fortuna's magic had run out and they lost 0–1 on a late goal by <a href="Pierre%20Littbarski">Pierre Littbarski</a>.
In 1986, the side came close to a return to the Bundesliga, but was beaten by Borussia Dortmund in the promotion round. Each team had won their home match in a two-game series, which forced a third contest under the rules in effect at the time. Instead of advancing on the strength of away goals, Fortuna was crushed 0–8 by Borussia Dortmund. A handful of seasons later the club avoided relegation to third tier football at the end of the 1991–92 schedule only when division rivals <a href="Blau-Wei%C3%9F%2090%20Berlin">Blau-Weiß 90 Berlin</a> were denied a licence.
One of the key features of Fortuna's history was the presidency of deep-pocketed <a href="Jean%20L%C3%B6ring">Jean Löring</a>. Beginning in 1967, the millionaire's support of the club helped them to continue to field competitive sides for much longer than they might otherwise have. In 1982, he even helped out in another way: trained as an electrician, he personally fixed the floodlights when they failed during a match against <a href="SV%20Darmstadt%2098">SV Darmstadt 98</a> so the game could go on. Löring, who had been an <a href="Oberliga%20West%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga</a> player himself with <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Alemannia Aachen</a> in his younger years, was ousted as president in 2000 and the club soon deteriorated. In 2005 the club failed financially and was forced to withdraw from league play.
Since 2008, the club has been owned (like <a href="Ebbsfleet%20United%20F.C.">Ebbsfleet United F.C.</a>) partially by the web-based venture <a href="deinfussballclub.de">deinfussballclub.de</a>. Until 2008, the SCF played in the fifth division Verbandsliga Mittelrhein, gaining promotion with a second place finish to the new <a href="Oberliga%20Nordrhein-Westfalen">Oberliga Nordrhein-Westfalen</a>. Fortuna Köln finished Oberliga as ninth in 2008–09, as 15th in 2009–10 season and as third in 2010–2011 saison. From the 2011–12 season the club played in the <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> until in 2014 they won that league and beat the <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich%20II">second team of Bayern Munich</a> to get promoted to the <a href="3.%20Liga">German third league</a>.
Despite insolvency, the club was able to salvage its youth department, one of the largest in Germany with over 500 players on 25 teams, through a fundraising campaign organized by the former chairman Egbert Bischoff that included a benefit game against 1. FC Köln.
Recent chairman <a href="Klaus%20Ulonska">Klaus Ulonska</a> once competed in the <a href="1962%20European%20Championships%20in%20Athletics">1962 European Championships in Athletics</a>, co-winning the 4 × 100 m Relay.

The club claimed an official founding date of 18 September 1909 as Ballspiel-Verein Wattenscheid out of the merger of two earlier sides known as BV Sodalität der Wattenscheid and BV Teutonia Wattenscheid.
On 23 October 2019, the club filed for <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> and retired from the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Regionalliga%23Regionalliga%20West">2019–20 Regionalliga West season</a>, so it was relegated to the <a href="Oberliga%20Westfalen">Oberliga Westfalen</a>.
History.
The club played quietly as a local side until briefly coming to notice in the <a href="World%20War%20II">war-ravaged</a> Gauliga Westfalen, then a division of top flight German football, in the abbreviated 1944–45 season.
In 1958, Wattenscheid joined the Verbandsliga Westfalen (III) and a title there in 1969 saw the club promoted to the Regionalliga West (II). Despite a Regionalliga title in 1974 they did not move up due to the restructuring of the German competition, but instead continued to play second-division football in the newly formed <a href="2.%20Bundesliga%20Nord%20%281974%E2%80%9381%29">2. Bundesliga Nord</a>. Through a period from the late 70s on to the late 80s the team struggled somewhat, earning uneven results and having several close brushes with relegation. They played well enough to earn a 10th-place finish in 1981 and stay up when the 2. Bundesliga Nord and 2. Bundesliga Süd were combined into a single division, but the next year they escaped being sent down in the bottom four only because <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">TSV 1860 Munich</a> was denied a license and was instead forced down to tier III play.
From that point the club slowly turned itself around and in 1990 earned promotion to the top-flight by way of a second-place result in their division. However, their <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> stay was a brief four years with their best result being an 11th-place finish in their debut season. The most memorable matches in this period are the victory in the derby against <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a> in 1992 (2–0) and the two victories against German record champion <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in 1991 (3–2) and 1993 (2–0). After relegation in 1994, Wattenscheid spent two campaigns in the 2. Bundesliga, before slipping to <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a> in 1996 for one season and returned for two campaigns back in the 2. Bundesliga. In 1999, Wattenscheid was slipping to <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a> and <a href="Oberliga%20%28football%29">Oberliga</a> in 2004. The next season, in 2005, they could advance to the Regionalliga again. Two consecutive relegations brought them to the <a href="Verbandsliga">Verbandsliga</a> Westfalen in 2007, where they played for one season before qualifying for the new <a href="Oberliga%20Nordrhein-Westfalen">Oberliga Nordrhein-Westfalen</a>. Wattenscheid played Oberliga for 2 seasons and relegated again to Verbandsliga after finishing 18th in 2009–10 season.
After winning the regional Westfalenpokal in 1996, Wattenscheid qualified for the first round of <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> in 1996–97 where they faced <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, at that time the reigning German champions. They won the match 4–3 (after extra time) but were eliminated by <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a> II in the following round, losing 4–2 in a penalty shootout.

TSG 1899 Hoffenheim

Turn- und Sportgemeinschaft 1899 Hoffenheim e.V., or simply TSG Hoffenheim, or just Hoffenheim (), is a German professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Hoffenheim">Hoffenheim</a>, a village of <a href="Sinsheim">Sinsheim</a>, <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>.
Originally founded in 1899 as a gymnastics club, Hoffenheim came into being in its modern form in 1945. A fifth division side in 2000, the club rapidly advanced through the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a> with the financial backing of alumnus and software mogul <a href="Dietmar%20Hopp">Dietmar Hopp</a>, and in 2008 Hoffenheim was promoted to the top tier <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. In the 2017–18 season, Hoffenheim finished third in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> (its best to date), qualifying for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> group stage for the first time.
Since 2009, Hoffenheim has played its home games at the <a href="Rhein-Neckar-Arena">Rhein-Neckar-Arena</a> (currently known as PreZero Arena), having previously played at the <a href="Dietmar-Hopp-Stadion">Dietmar-Hopp-Stadion</a> from 1999.
History.
The modern-day club was formed in 1945, when gymnastics club Turnverein Hoffenheim (founded 1 July 1899) and football club Fußballverein Hoffenheim (founded 1921) merged. At the beginning of the 1990s, the club was an obscure local amateur side playing in the eighth division Baden-Württemberg A-Liga. They steadily improved and by 1996 were competing in the <a href="Verbandsliga%20Nordbaden">Verbandsliga Nordbaden</a> (V).
Around 2000, alumnus <a href="Dietmar%20Hopp">Dietmar Hopp</a> returned to the club of his youth as a financial backer. Hopp was the co-founder of software firm <a href="SAP%20AG">SAP</a> and he put some of his money into the club. His contributions generated almost immediate results: in 2000 Hoffenheim finished first in the Verbandsliga and was promoted to the fourth-tier <a href="Oberliga%20Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Oberliga Baden-Württemberg</a>. Another first-place finish moved the club up to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a> (III) for the 2001–02 season. They finished 13th in their first season in the Regionalliga, but improved significantly the next year, earning a fifth-place result.
Hoffenheim earned fifth and seventh-place finishes in the next two seasons, before improving to fourth in 2005–06 to earn their best result to date. The club made its first <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> appearance in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20DFB-Pokal">2003–04</a> competition and performed well, advancing to the quarter-finals by eliminating <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> sides <a href="Eintracht%20Trier">Eintracht Trier</a> and <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a> and <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> club <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> before being put out themselves by another 2. Bundesliga side, <a href="VfB%20L%C3%BCbeck">VfB Lübeck</a>.
Negotiations to merge TSG Hoffenheim, <a href="FC%20Astoria%20Walldorf">Astoria Walldorf</a>, and <a href="SV%20Sandhausen">SV Sandhausen</a> to create "FC Heidelberg 06" in 2005 were abandoned due to the resistance of the latter two clubs, and the failure to agree on whether the new side's stadium should be located in <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> or <a href="Eppelheim">Eppelheim</a>. Team owner Hopp clearly preferred Heidelberg, but could not overcome the resistance of local firm <a href="Wild%20%28company%29">Wild</a>, which had already reserved the site of the planned stadium for its new production facilities.
2006–2008: Major investments, promotion to the Bundesliga.
In 2006, the club sought to improve its squad and technical staff by bringing in players with several years of Bundesliga experience, most notably <a href="Jochen%20Seitz">Jochen Seitz</a> and <a href="Tomislav%20Mari%C4%87">Tomislav Marić</a>, and young talents like <a href="Sejad%20Salihovi%C4%87">Sejad Salihović</a>, while signing manager <a href="Ralf%20Rangnick">Ralf Rangnick</a>, who managed Bundesliga teams such as <a href="SSV%20Ulm%201846">SSV Ulm 1846</a>, <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>, <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a> and <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, to a five-year contract. The investment paid off in the 2006–07 season with the club's promotion to the 2. Bundesliga after finishing second in <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>.
The <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%202.%20Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a> was Hoffenheim's first season in professional football. After a weak start with three losses and only one draw in the first four games, the team's performance improved remarkably and Hoffenheim climbed from 16th place on matchday four to second place on matchday 23. The team defended their place until the end of the season, having scored 60 points after matchday 34. As a result of their second-place finish, they received automatic promotion to the Bundesliga, the highest tier in German football, after playing in the 2. Bundesliga for just one season.
2008–present: Growth of the club and Champions League football.
Hoffenheim recorded a 7th place finish in their debut <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim%20season">season</a> in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's top division. The club's best players of the season were <a href="Vedad%20Ibi%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Vedad Ibišević</a> and <a href="Demba%20Ba">Demba Ba</a>, who scored 18 and 14 goals respectively. In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Bundesliga">2009–10 Bundesliga</a>, the club had a less successful season, recording a finish outside of the top 10, finishing 11th. The club finished in consceutive 11th places for the next two seasons. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13 Bundesliga</a>, the club came very close to suffering relegation, after a 16th place finish, meaning they would have to play in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga%23Relegation%20play-offs">relegation play-offs</a> to survive; the club went on to beat their opponents <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a> by a scoreline of 5–2 on aggregate over <a href="Two-legged%20tie">two legs</a>, with <a href="Roberto%20Firmino">Roberto Firmino</a> scoring two goals in the first leg. In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bundesliga">2013–14 Bundesliga</a>, the club had strange statistics; being the third best goalscoring team in the league, but also the worst defensive team, scoring 72 goals and conceding 70. The club's best goalscorer of the season, also their best assist provider, was Roberto Firmino, scoring 16 goals and providing 12 assists, with the player winning the <a href="Roberto%20Firmino%23Honours">Bundesliga Breakthrough Player of the Season</a> award. In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15 Bundesliga</a>, the club came very close to qualifying for the Europa League, with just two points separating them from <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, who were in 7th place. Despite the 8th place finish, Hoffenheim still had a <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a> of −6 in the 2014–15 season. In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16 Bundesliga</a>, the club once again came close to suffering relegation, with just one point separating them from the relegation play-offs.
In the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim%20season">2016–17 season</a>, new coach <a href="Julian%20Nagelsmann">Julian Nagelsmann</a> took over, beginning to recruit several new players, including <a href="Andrej%20Kramari%C4%87">Andrej Kramarić</a>, <a href="Kerem%20Demirbay">Kerem Demirbay</a> and <a href="Sandro%20Wagner">Sandro Wagner</a>. Initially, the club struggled for form, with four draws in the first four games of the season, before a rise in form rose the club to 3rd place in the league by the end of October. On 4 April 2017, the club beat <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> by a scoreline of 1–0, one of the most significant wins in the club's history. On 21 April 2017, the club confirmed that they would play European football next season following a 1–1 draw with <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">Köln</a>. Following a 4th place finish in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Bundesliga">2016–17 Bundesliga</a>, Hoffenheim confirmed <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> football for the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim%20season">2017–18 season</a>. The club were eventually drawn to play <a href="List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals">six-time</a> European champions <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20qualifying%20phase%20and%20play-off%20round%23Play-off%20round">play-off round</a>. The club lost the first leg by a scoreline of 1–2, before a 4–2 loss in the second leg confirmed Hoffenheim's elimination from the tournament, as the club lost 3–6 on aggregate. Due to their elimination from the play-off stages, the club would continue playing European football in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> group stages; however, the club would suffer elimination from the tournament as they would finish bottom of their group.
In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Bundesliga">2017–18 Bundesliga season</a>, Hoffenheim had a successful season, finishing third, automatically qualifying for the next year's Champions League.
The <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Bundesliga">2018–19 season</a> was more disappointing for Hoffenheim, as they finished bottom of their Champions League group with only 3 draws and 3 losses whilst playing against the likes of <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a> and <a href="FC%20Shakhtar%20Donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a>. This meant that they did not make it out of the group stages of a European competition again. In the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Hoffenheim didn't fare much better, finishing a disappointing 9th place, 6 places below their ranking of 3rd during the 2017–18 campaign with 51 points. This was just two places and 3 points away from the Europa League qualifying rounds. In the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, Hoffenheim were eliminated by <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> in a 2–0 loss with two goals from <a href="Timo%20Werner">Timo Werner</a>. The season's top scorer was <a href="Andrej%20Kramari%C4%87">Andre Kramarić</a>, with the Croatian finding the goal 22 times in 37 appearances. The German <a href="Kerem%20Demirbay">Kerem Demirbay</a> had the most assists with 11 assists during the 2018–19 season. Head coach Julian Nagelsmann left the club to join RB Leipzig at the end of the season. <a href="Alfred%20Schreuder">Alfred Schreuder</a>, former assistant coach under Huub Stevens and Julian Nagelsmann was appointed as the new head coach.

Before being promoted to the Bundesliga in 2008, the club played in the <a href="Dietmar-Hopp-Stadion">Dietmar-Hopp-Stadion</a>, which was built in 1999 with a capacity of 5,000 (1,620 seats).
"TSG 1899 Hoffenheim" made their lofty ambitions clear in 2006, when the club's management decided to begin building the new 30,150 seat <a href="Rhein-Neckar-Arena">Rhein-Neckar-Arena</a> suitable for hosting Bundesliga matches. The stadium was originally to be built in <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> before the selection of a site in <a href="Sinsheim">Sinsheim</a>.
They opened their first season in the Bundesliga at the 26,022 capacity <a href="Carl-Benz-Stadion">Carl-Benz-Stadion</a> in <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a>, and played their first match in their new stadium on 31 January 2009.

Controversy.
Criticism of the club.
Dietmar Hopp's financial support, which transformed Hoffenheim from a local amateur club into a competitive Bundesliga club, has been strongly criticized by other clubs, fans and some in the German press. The main points of criticism are the club's purported lack of tradition and a historically large fanbase, as the club is a historically insignificant side from a village of just 3,300 inhabitants. This situation is similar to that of now-defunct Scottish side <a href="Gretna%20FC">Gretna</a> and German clubs <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a>, <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> and <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a>, as those teams also received large financial support; Wolfsburg is wholly owned and supported by automobile manufacturer <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a>, Bayer Leverkusen by pharmaceutical company <a href="Bayer">Bayer</a> and RB Leipzig by <a href="Red%20Bull">Red Bull</a>.
On 16 August 2011, the club released a statement regarding complaints of a loudspeaker that was strategically placed under away fans during a home game against Dortmund. The loudspeaker was designed to drown out the noise of the away fans cheers and chants during the game. It was reported that the speaker was placed by the groundskeeper, although the club denied any involvement, saying he acted alone. It was also reported that the loudspeaker was used during other games, not just the home game against Dortmund.
In a later statement, the club admitted that the disruptive sound assembly has been used at least five times, although club officials claim to have no knowledge of these measures.
On 29 February 2020, <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> supporters unfurled an offensive banner aimed at Hoffenheim owner <a href="Dietmar%20Hopp">Dietmar Hopp</a>, resulting in the match being suspended with less than 15 minutes left to play. After concerns that the game could be abandoned, both teams returned to finish the match, but had decided to just run down the clock to end the game in solidarity with Hopp. Rather than play on, the two teams began passing the ball between each other and chatting as if they were all teammates.
The very next day, the Bundesliga match between <a href="Vfl%20Wolfsburg">Vfl Wolfsburg</a> and <a href="Union%20Berlin">1. FC Union Berlin</a> was stopped at the 44th minute of play due to derogatory banners once again being unfurled, one of which showed Hopp under <a href="crosshairs">crosshairs</a>. The two teams left the field and returned 10 minutes later to play out the remainder of the 1st half and subsequently the game.

History.
1904–1927: Schalke's early years.
The club was founded on 4 May 1904 as Westfalia Schalke by a group of high school students and first wore the colours red and yellow. The team was unable to gain admittance to the "<a href="Western%20German%20Football%20Association">Westdeutscher Spielverband</a> (Western German Football Association)" and played in one of the "wild associations" of early German football. In 1912, after years of failed attempts to join the official league, they merged with the gymnastic club Schalker Turnverein 1877 in order to facilitate their entry. This arrangement held up until 1915, when SV Westfalia Schalke was re-established as an independent club. The separation proved short-lived and the two came together again in 1919 as Turn- und Sportverein Schalke 1877. The new club won its first honours in 1923 as champions of the "Schalke Kreisliga". It was around this time that Schalke picked up the nickname "Die Knappen", from an old German word for "miners" because the team drew so many of its players and supporters from the coal miners of Gelsenkirchen.
In 1924, the football team parted ways with the gymnasts again, this time taking the club chairman along with them. They took the name FC Schalke 04 and adopted the now familiar blue and white <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a> from which their second nickname would derive, "Die Königsblauen" (). The following year, the club became the dominant local side, based on a style of play that used short, sharp, man-to-man passing to move the ball. This system would later become famous as the "Schalker Kreisel" (). In 1927, it carried them into the top-flight "Gauliga Ruhr", onto the league championship, and then into the opening rounds of the national finals. 
1928–1933: Rise to dominance.
The popular club built a new stadium, the Glückauf-Kampfbahn, in 1928, and acknowledged the city's support by renaming themselves FC Gelsenkirchen-Schalke 04. They won their first West German championship in 1929, but the following year were sanctioned for exceeding salary levels set by the league and, in an era that considered professionalism in sport to be anathema, found themselves banned from play for nearly half a year.
However, the ban had little impact on the team's popularity: in their first match after the ban against <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>, in June 1931, the team drew 70,000 spectators to its home ground. The club's fortunes begun to rise from 1931 and they made a semi-final appearance in the <a href="1932%20German%20football%20championship">1932 German championship</a>, losing 1–2 to <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>. <a href="1933%20German%20football%20championship">The year after</a>, the club reached the final, where Fortuna Düsseldorf proved the better side, winning 3–0.
1933–1945: The championship years.
With the re-organisation of German football in 1933 under <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, Schalke were placed in the <a href="Gauliga%20Westfalen">Gauliga Westfalen</a>, 1 of 16 top-flight divisions established to replace the innumerable regional and local leagues, all claiming top status. This league saw Schalke's most successful decade in their history: from 1933 to 1942, the club would appear in 14 of 18 national finals (ten in the German championship and eight in the <a href="Tschammerpokal%23Tschammer-Pokal">Tschammerpokal</a>, the predecessor of today's <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>) and win their league in every one of its eleven seasons.
The club never lost a home match in the Gauliga Westfalen in all these 11 seasons and only lost six away matches, while remaining unbeaten in the 1935–36, 1936–37, 1937–38, 1938–39, 1940–41 and 1942–43 seasons, a sign of the club's dominance.
Schalke's first <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions%23German%20football%20championships%20in%20Nazi%20Germany%20%281933%E2%80%9345%29">national title</a> came in <a href="1934%20German%20football%20championship">1934</a> with a 2–1 victory over favourites <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>. <a href="1935%20German%20football%20championship">The next year</a>, they successfully defended their title against <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> with a 6–4 win. The club missed the <a href="1936%20German%20football%20championship">1936</a> final, but would make appearances in the championship match in each of the next six years, coming away victorious in <a href="1937%20German%20football%20championship">1937</a>, <a href="1939%20German%20football%20championship">1939</a>, <a href="1940%20German%20football%20championship">1940</a> and <a href="1942%20German%20football%20championship">1942</a>. Three of those national finals were against Austrian teams – <a href="VfB%20Admira%20Wacker%20M%C3%B6dling">Admira Wien</a>, <a href="SK%20Rapid%20Wien">Rapid Wien</a> and <a href="First%20Vienna%20FC">First Vienna</a> – which played in Germany's Gauliga Ostmark after Austria's incorporation into the Reich through the 1938 "<a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>".
"Die Königsblauen" also made frequent appearances in the final of the Tschammerpokal, but enjoyed much less success there. They lost the <a href="1935%20Tschammerpokal">inaugural Tschammerpokal</a> 0–2 to 1. FC Nürnberg in 1935. They also made failed appearances in the <a href="1936%20Tschammerpokal">1936</a>, <a href="1941%20Tschammerpokal">1941</a>, and <a href="1942%20Tschammerpokal">1942</a> finals with their only victory coming in <a href="1937%20Tschammerpokal">1937</a> against Fortuna Düsseldorf.
Over a dozen seasons, from 1933 to 1945, Schalke won 162 of 189 Gauliga matches, drawing 21 and losing only 6. Within this period, they scored 924 goals and conceded just 145. From 1935 to 1939, they did not lose a single league match. The club's dominance throughout this period led them to be held up for propaganda purposes by the <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> regime as an example of "new Germany".
1945–1959: Football after World War II.
With Germany in chaos towards the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Schalke played just two matches in 1945. They resumed regular play following the war and, for a time, continued to compete as a strong side. They set a record in a national championship round match with a 20–0 win against <a href="2.%20Oberliga%20West%23Overview">SpVgg Herten</a>, but that spoke more to the weakened condition of German football than to the ability of the team. Schalke's play fell off and the best they could manage in the new Oberliga West in 1947 was a sixth-place finish. Within two years, they slipped to 12th place.
It would take Schalke until the mid-1950s to recover their form. They finished third in a tight three-way race for the 1954 Oberliga West title, decided on the last day of the season. The following year, they appeared in the <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> final, where they lost 2–3 to <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a>. The club's next, and to date last, German championship came in <a href="German%20football%20championship%201958">1958</a> with a 3–0 victory over <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>. The strong fanbase of the club is as well documented in a local church, St. Joseph, in Gelsenkirchen. It was renovated shortly after the 1958 victory, where one of the glass windows shows <a href="Aloysius%20Gonzaga">Aloysius Gonzaga</a> with a football and the dress and colours of Schalke.
1960–2000: Entry to the Bundesliga and the "Euro Fighters".
Schalke continued to play well, having several top four finishes in the years leading up to the 1963 formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, West Germany's new federal, professional league. Those results earned them selection as 1 of 16 clubs admitted to the top-flight league.
Their first years in the Bundesliga were difficult. In <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20Bundesliga">1964–65</a>, they escaped relegation only through the expansion of the league to 18 teams. A number of finishes at the lower end of the league table followed, before a marked improvement in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Bundesliga">1971–72</a>, culminating in a second-place finish to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> and after having led the league for much of the season. In the same season, Schalke won the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> for the second time in its history.
Despite their improved results, the seeds of a major reversal had already been sown. A number of the team's players and officials were accused of accepting <a href="Bribes%23Sport%20corruption">bribes</a> as part of the widespread <a href="Bundesliga%20scandal%20%281971%29">Bundesliga scandal of 1971</a>. Investigation showed that Schalke had deliberately played to lose their 17 May, 28th-round match against <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a>, 0–1. As a result, several Schalke players were banned for life, including three – <a href="Klaus%20Fischer">Klaus Fischer</a>, <a href="Reinhard%20Libuda">"Stan" Libuda</a> and <a href="Klaus%20Fichtel">Klaus Fichtel</a> – who regularly played for the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany national team</a> at the time.
Even though the penalties were later commuted to bans ranging from six months to two years, the scandal had a profound effect on what might have possibly become one of the dominant German teams of the 1970s. In 1973, the club moved to the <a href="Parkstadion">Parkstadion</a>, newly built for the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 FIFA World Cup</a> and having a capacity of 70,000 spectators. In the wake of the scandal, the club's performance was uneven. They managed another second-place result in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Bundesliga">1976–77</a>, finishing just one point behind champions <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>.
In the early 1980s, "Die Knappen" ran into trouble and were relegated to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">second division of the Bundesliga</a> for the 1981–82 season and, after promotion, again in 1983–84. They returned to the top flight in <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Bundesliga">1984</a> but slipped once more to the second tier in 1988. They returned to the Bundesliga in the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Bundesliga">1991–92</a> season and stayed in the top flight until 2021.
The club earned their first honours since the DFB-Pokal win of 1972 with a victory in the final of the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20UEFA%20Cup">1996–97 UEFA Cup</a> over <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> on penalties. Coached by the Dutch coach <a href="Huub%20Stevens">Huub Stevens</a>, the 1997 Schalke squad earned the nickname "Euro Fighters", which is still in use among fans. Stevens, who was widely unknown in Germany at the time, quickly earned himself a cult following among the Schalke supporters.
Stevens successfully implemented a system of rigid discipline, especially in the defence. His motto "Die Null muß stehen" (in <a href="English%20language">English</a>, "It has to read nil"), which emphasized his importance on his side not conceding any goals, has found its way into everyday language in Germany.
2000–2019: Top-table mainstay, European semi-final.
During the 1990s and early 2000, the club underwent a transformation into a modern, commercial sports organization and established itself as one of the dominant teams of the Bundesliga. Schalke won consecutive DFB-Pokals in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20DFB-Pokal">2000–01</a> and <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20DFB-Pokal">2001–02</a>, and earned second-place finishes in the Bundesliga in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Bundesliga">2000–01</a>, <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Bundesliga">2004–05</a> and <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07</a>. The <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20FC%20Schalke%2004%20season">2000–01</a> season finish was heartbreaking for Schalke's supporters as it took a goal in the fourth minute of injury time by Bayern Munich away to Hamburger SV to snatch the title from "Die Königsblauen".
 Schalke finished in second place in 2005, a result that led to Schalke making its second appearance in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>. There, Schalke finished in third place during the group stage and continuing into the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, where they were eliminated by the eventual winners <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> in the semi-finals. In <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06</a>, Schalke finished in fourth place in the Bundesliga and a year later they again finished as runners-up for the third time in seven seasons.
In the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2007–08 season</a>, Schalke progressed past the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> group stage for the first time and advanced to the quarter-finals after defeating <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a> on penalties in the round of 16. They were eliminated by <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the quarter-finals, losing both home and away matches 0–1.
On 9 October 2006, Russian oil company <a href="Gazprom">Gazprom</a> became the club's new sponsor. The company stated it expected to invest as much as €125 million in the club over a five-and-a-half-year period. Gazprom's sponsorship has been seen by some analysts as a politically motivated attempt to buy friendship in Germany. Within this sponsorship, Schalke 04 and <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">Zenit Saint Petersburg</a> signed a "partnership agreement"; both clubs intended to work closely on improving football-related issues.
On 13 April 2008, the club announced the dismissal of manager <a href="Mirko%20Slomka">Mirko Slomka</a> after a heavy defeat at the hands of <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> and elimination from the Champions League. Former players <a href="Mike%20B%C3%BCskens">Mike Büskens</a> and <a href="Youri%20Mulder">Youri Mulder</a> were put in charge of the first team on an interim basis. For the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Bundesliga">2008–09 Bundesliga season</a>, Schalke signed a new head coach, <a href="Fred%20Rutten">Fred Rutten</a>, previously of <a href="FC%20Twente">Twente</a>. Rutten signed a contract running until June 2010. In March 2009, Rutten was sacked, and, once more, Mike Büskens, Youri Mulder and Oliver Reck took over the helm.
On 1 July 2009, <a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a>, who had led <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> to the top of the table in the Bundesliga, became head coach and general manager of the "Königsblauen". The appointment of Magath as manager coincided with a multimillion-euro spending spree, allowing Schalke to acquire internationally known forwards <a href="Klaas-Jan%20Huntelaar">Klaas-Jan Huntelaar</a> and <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20%28footballer%29">Raúl</a>. Magath's tenure at the club was initially successful, seeing the side score a glut of goals in the first few months of the season, though defensive frailties and Magath's questionable squad selection had made him unpopular with Schalke supporters by December 2010.
On 16 March 2011, Magath was sacked, and replaced with <a href="Ralf%20Rangnick">Ralf Rangnick</a>, who previously, between 2004 and 2005, had a brief spell being in charge of the team. Within just weeks of his appointment, Rangnick masterminded a 5–2 victory over Inter Milan at the <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a> during the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase">quarter-finals</a> of the Champions League. Schalke advanced to the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%23Semi-finals">semi-final</a> where they lost 2–0 to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the first leg and 4–1 in the second leg. However, Schalke 04 managed to win the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20DFB-Pokal">2010–11 DFB-Pokal</a> after thrashing <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a> 5-0. On 1 June 2011, Schalke's captain, <a href="Manuel%20Neuer">Manuel Neuer</a>, made his move to Bayern Munich.
On 22 September 2011, Ralf Rangnick announced his immediate resignation as head coach of Schalke 04 due to <a href="Burnout%20%28psychology%29">long-term exhaustion</a>. Assistant coach Seppo Eichkorn coached the team as interim manager until the appointment of Huub Stevens on 27 September 2011. Stevens' contract was to run until 30 June 2013.
Despite having legendary status among Schalke supporters, Stevens's return to Schalke was met with some scepticism, as fans feared that Stevens, who coached Schalke to the 1997 UEFA Cup win with a rigidly defensive system, could abandon Rangnick's system of attacking play in favour of returning to his 1997 defensive antics. The doubts of the supporters proved unfounded. Although Schalke played a somewhat inconsistent season, they reached third place in the Bundesliga and therefore direct qualification for the UEFA Champions League.
Schalke had an excellent start to the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13 Bundesliga season</a>, and worked their way to second place in the league by November, just behind Bayern Munich. On 20 October, Schalke traveled to <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> for matchday 8, and were able to defeat the home side 2–1 to secure their first league "<a href="Revierderby">Revierderby</a>" win since February 2010 while securing a Champions League place by finishing in fourth place. In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage">2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage</a>, Schalke's opponents were <a href="FCSB">FCSB</a>, <a href="FC%20Basel">FC Basel</a> and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. Schalke ultimately finished the group stage in second place, behind Chelsea, and was eliminated in the round of 16 by <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid CF</a>.
The most prominent Schalke addition was the arrival of <a href="Kevin-Prince%20Boateng">Kevin-Prince Boateng</a> from <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a>. After a disappointing first round of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Bundesliga">2013–14 Bundesliga</a> that saw Schalke in seventh place in the Bundesliga table, as well as an early exit from the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20DFB-Pokal">2013–14 DFB-Pokal</a> in the first knockout round, the club played their most successful second half of the season in club history. The season was marked by a glut of injuries to key squad players, including <a href="Jefferson%20Farf%C3%A1n">Jefferson Farfán</a> and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, for almost the entire season. It also led to performance related discussions about head coach Jens Keller. Partially, Schalke fielded up to ten young players with potential who played in the Schalke youth system throughout the season. Among the brightest young player discoveries of the 2013–14 season were <a href="Max%20Meyer%20%28footballer%29">Max Meyer</a> and <a href="Leon%20Goretzka">Leon Goretzka</a>. The young Schalke squad won 11 out of 17 matches, totalling 36 points. At the end of the 2013–14 season, the club finished in third place in the Bundesliga table to qualify for their third-straight UEFA Champions League appearance, a feat Schalke had never before achieved.
On 7 October 2014, after a 1–2 defeat to <a href="TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim">1899 Hoffenheim</a> and after amassing just eight points from seven matches, Keller was sacked and succeeded by <a href="Roberto%20Di%20Matteo">Roberto Di Matteo</a>.
In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2014–15 UEFA Champions League</a>, Schalke 04 finished second in a group with <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, <a href="Sporting%20CP">Sporting CP</a> and <a href="NK%20Maribor">Maribor</a>. Later on, they played against the reigning champion Real Madrid again in the round of 16, where they lost the first leg at home 0–2, but they won 4–3 at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a>. After finishing sixth in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15 season</a>, the club announced the resignation of head coach Roberto Di Matteo on 26 May 2015. Schalke 04 then played in the Europa League, in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2015–16</a> and <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2016–17</a> seasons, and were eliminated by <a href="FC%20Shakhtar%20Donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a> and <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> respectively.
Starting with the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Bundesliga">2017–18 season</a>, <a href="Domenico%20Tedesco">Domenico Tedesco</a> took over the managerial spot for Schalke 04. At the end of the season, he led the team to finish as runners-up to Bayern Munich. On 29 July 2018, the team's captain, <a href="Benedikt%20H%C3%B6wedes">Benedikt Höwedes</a>, decided to leave after more than ten years at the club.
2019–2020: Financial crisis.
In the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2018–19 UEFA Champions League</a>, Schalke 04 lost 2–10 in aggregate to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in the round of 16. Two days later, on 14 March 2019, Tedesco was relieved of his duties. <a href="Huub%20Stevens">Huub Stevens</a> and <a href="Mike%20B%C3%BCskens">Mike Büskens</a> took over as <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker managers</a>. On 9 May 2019, <a href="David%20Wagner%20%28soccer%29">David Wagner</a> was appointed as head coach of Schalke 04 on a three-year contract until 30 June 2022.
Schalke was hit particularly hard by the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and in April 2020 the club said that it was threatened by bankruptcy. Against the backdrop of a worsened financial situation caused by a high level of debt and a decrease in revenue related to <a href="Impact%20of%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic%20on%20association%20football%23Europe">restrictions put in place to combat the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the club decided to introduce a player salary cap of €2.5 million per year.
In the second half of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bundesliga">2019–20 season</a>, Schalke set a new club record of 16 league games without a win between 25 January and 27 June 2020. Despite this losing streak, Wagner remained as manager, with <a href="Clemens%20T%C3%B6nnies">Clemens Tönnies</a> stepping down from his role as the chairman of Schalke's supervisory board after 19 years in service instead.
2020–present: Relegation and Promotion.
Schalke started with significant difficulties into the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Bundesliga">2020–21 season</a>. After 8–0 and 4–0 thrashings away at the hands of Bayern Munich and <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> and a 1–3 loss at home against Werder Bremen, Schalke was last in the league table after three games, with one goal scored and fifteen conceded. After only two match days, Schalke dismissed David Wagner as head coach on 27 September in the aftermath of the loss against Bremen. At 1.08 average points per game, Wagner was then the lowest-scoring head coach in Schalke's recent history.
Three days later, <a href="Manuel%20Baum">Manuel Baum</a> was nominated as Wagner's successor, with <a href="Naldo%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201982%29">Naldo</a>, a former Schalke player, as assistant coach. Baum, who had taken over from Wagner at a winless streak of 18 games, was unable to win a single Bundesliga game between the 3rd and 12th match days, and was dismissed ahead of the 13th match day against Arminia Bielefeld. Huub Stevens once again returned as head coach, beginning his fourth tenure. Baum's tenure had brought the winless streak up from 18 to 28 Bundesliga games, bringing Schalke to the brink of breaking the all-time record of 31 winless games, set by <a href="SC%20Tasmania%201900%20Berlin">SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin</a> in the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20Bundesliga">1965–66 season</a>. Stevens did not change Schalke's fortunes in his first game, losing the home game against Arminia Bielefeld, themselves in 16th place and thus threatened by relegation, with a 0–1 scoreline.
On 27 December 2020, Schalke 04 announced that they signed a contract with Swiss manager <a href="Christian%20Gross">Christian Gross</a> to be the head coach of the club until the end of the season, making him the fourth head coach for Schalke 04 during the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20FC%20Schalke%2004%20season">2020–21 season</a>. Under Gross, Schalke's negative streak continued with a 3–0 loss to <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a>, marking the 30th consecutive winless game, a losing streak of 358 days. On 9 January 2021 Schalke finally recorded a victory over <a href="TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim">1899 Hoffenheim</a>, which meant they avoided matching Tasmania Berlin's record. It remained Schalke's only victory under Gross, who was sacked as head coach after just eleven matches on 28 February 2021, following losses against rival Borussia Dortmund (0–4) and <a href="VFB%20Stuttgart">VFB Stuttgart</a> (1–5). Alongside Gross, sporting director Jochen Schneider, team coordinator Sascha Riether, assistant coach Rainer Widmayer and fitness coach Werner Leuthard were also relieved of their duties. At 0.45 average points per game, Gross was the least successful head coach at Schalke since <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Marotzke">Karl-Heinz Marotzke</a> in 1967.
On 2 March 2021, <a href="Dimitrios%20Grammozis">Dimitrios Grammozis</a> was announced as new head coach for Schalke 04. Grammozis started with a scoreless draw against <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">Mainz 05</a>, but his team was unable to collect any points in the two following matches, which were lost 5–0 against <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a> and 3–0 against <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>. Schalke did not score a goal in the first three matches under Grammozis, a joined negative record for the club (Helmut Schulte in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Bundesliga">1992–93</a> and Markus Weinzierl in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Bundesliga">2016–17</a> also waited for the first goal until their fourth match as head coach for Schalke). Against Borussia Mönchengladbach, Schalke conceded its fifth <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> of the season, yet another negative record.
Relegation to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> was confirmed on 20 April 2021, as Schalke 04 lost 1–0 to <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a>, which led to riots by Schalke supporters.
On 28 February 2022, following <a href="2022%20Russian%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>, Schalke cancelled their contract with main sponsor <a href="Gazprom">Gazprom</a>, further straining the club's financial situation. Grammozis was sacked as head coach on 6 March 2022, as promotion back to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> appeared uncertain. He was replaced by <a href="Mike%20B%C3%BCskens">Mike Büskens</a> as caretaker manager until the end of the season. Schalke recovered under Büskens, winning eight of the remaining nine matches. The club secured promotion on 7 May 2022, following a 3–2 victory over <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a> that guaranteed a top-two finish in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. Fans invaded the pitch in celebration. One week later Schalke won the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in dramatic fashion after a 88th minute winner by <a href="Simon%20Terodde">Simon Terodde</a> defeating <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> 2–1.
At the end of the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%202.%20Bundesliga">2021–22 season</a>, Büskens moved back to the position of <a href="assistant%20coach">assistant coach</a>. On 7 June 2022, Schalke appointed <a href="Frank%20Kramer%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201972%29">Frank Kramer</a> as head coach. As a result of the club's financial problems, most of the players who were essential for the success in the previous season, like <a href="Ko%20Itakura">Ko Itakura</a>, could not be kept, and Schalke struggled to be competitive at the beginning of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Bundesliga">2022–23 season</a>. Following a series of humiliating losses, including a 1–5 against <a href="TSG%201899%20Hoffenheim">Hoffenheim</a>, Kramer was relieved of his duties on 19 October 2022. At the time, Schalke was 17th in the Bundesliga after ten matchdays. <a href="Matthias%20Kreutzer">Matthias Kreutzer</a> took over as caretaker manager. A week after Kramer's dismissal, on 26 October 2022, sporting director <a href="Rouven%20Schr%C3%B6der">Rouven Schröder</a> also announced his instant resignation.
On 27 October 2022, <a href="Thomas%20Reis">Thomas Reis</a> was named as Schalke's new head coach. The first match under Reis, against <a href="SC%20Freiburg">SC Freiburg</a>, was lost 0–2, marking Schalke's seventh consecutive loss. After the game, commentators like <a href="Huub%20Stevens">Huub Stevens</a> praised the team for its better organization, compared to previous matches. Schalke finished the first half of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Bundesliga">2022–23 Bundesliga season</a> in 18th and last position in the table, with just nine points to their name. Following a humiliating 1–6 against RB Leipzig on match day 17, the club noticeably improved, especially in the defense. Between match days 18 and 21, Schalke played 0–0 four times in a row, a new Bundesliga record. The following two matches were won, and on 4 March 2023, Schalke left the last place in the table for the first time since October 2022.
On 19 February 2023, four people were seriously injured when a group of about 100 people, assumed to be supporters of Schalke's rivals <a href="Rot-Weiss%20Essen">Rot-Weiss Essen</a> and <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, attacked a group of Schalke supporters with baseball bats and screwdrivers. The incident sparked fears over the upcoming derby against Dortmund. This came less than three weeks after the police had uncovered a possible plot by radical Dortmund supporters, who had tried to hide razor blades behind stickers in the stadium ahead of Dortmund's match against <a href="Mainz%2005">Mainz</a>. In 2014, the police had warned of a similar danger ahead of the derby, after razor blades were found in the stadium hidden behind anti-Schalke stickers. On 11 March 2023, in the 100th derby between the two clubs, Schalke played 2–2 against Borussia Dortmund, who were in second place at the time. This ended Dortmund's streak of eight wins in a row. The police called the match "extremely peaceful" and drew a positive balance. On the final matchday of the 2022–23 season, Schalke relegated to the second division after a 4–2 loss against RB Leipzig, in which they finished 17th in the league table.
Sponsors and finances.

In the year 2000, the supporters voted for "Schalker Jahrhundertelf", the "Team of the Century":
Stadium.
Schalke's stadium, known as the <a href="Arena%20AufSchalke">Veltins-Arena</a> under a sponsorship agreement with <a href="Veltins">Veltins</a> brewery, was built in the summer of 2001 and has a capacity of 62,271 spectators. Schalke regularly draws sell-out crowds to what is widely regarded as one of the most modern and best multi-use facilities in Europe. The facility was previously known as the Arena AufSchalke and replaced the <a href="Parkstadion">Parkstadion</a> (capacity of 62,000) built in 1973. Prior to this, the club played its matches in the <a href="Gl%C3%BCckauf-Kampfbahn">Glückauf-Kampfbahn</a>, constructed in 1928 with a capacity of 35,000. The facility was used for amateur matches during its later years with a reduced capacity of 5,000.
Fan culture.
The number of members of Schalke 04 grew from 10,000 in 1991 to 160,000 in 2022. This figure makes Schalke 04 the second-biggest sports club in Germany and fourth-biggest sports club in the world, behind Bayern Munich, <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>, and <a href="Boca%20Juniors">CA Boca Juniors</a>. As of 2022, Schalke is ranked as the 94th-best football club in Europe and in Continental Europe by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>'s <a href="UEFA%20coefficient%23UEFA%20Team%20Ranking">UEFA club rankings</a>. A representation of the Schalke 04 membership structure in 2014 showed, among other things, a female share of 20 per cent and a share of the age group up to ten years of 14 per cent. Around 30 per cent of the members were not from North Rhine-Westphalia. Apart from Gelsenkirchen (10,197 members) and its immediate neighbouring towns, the members of Schalke 04 also come from more distant cities such as <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> (1,117) and <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> (932). This high growth in Schalke 04 membership is also promoted by promotions of Schalke 04, as from 2013 to further "advertise Schalke 04 brand".
On 21 August 2013, Schalke 04 played their first home match of the 2013–14 season, a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> qualifier at the Veltins-Arena against the Greek runners-up <a href="PAOK%20FC">PAOK</a> (led by former head coach Huub Stevens), drawing 1–1. The match and result was more than overshadowed by a controversial police operation in the "S04 Ultras Gelsenkirchen" block of the Veltins-Arena against the fans of the home team with nearly 80 of the home team's fans injured. The return match was won 3–2 by Schalke without any of their supporters allowed to attend the match.
Fan Club Association.
Schalke 04 Fan Club Association (SFCV) is an umbrella organization which, according to their own statement, has an estimated 1,500 fan clubs. Of those listed by the SFCV, 860 Schalke 04 fan clubs in October 2012 were divided geographically as follows: an estimated 200 were in Ruhr, 360 in the rest of North Rhine-Westphalia and 300 in the other federal states. A member of the board of SFCV has a permanent seat on the board of FC Schalke 04 and in 2013 SFCV merged with the "Ultras Gelsenkirchen" and later the supporters' club, Schalke Fan-Initiative eV with several members of strong fan groups from the SFCV, as is clear from the merger of the SFCV with the fan section of S04 has not adequately represented the fan interests.
Friendships.
The fan-base of Schalke is connected, in a friendly way, with the supporters of <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>, Dutch club <a href="FC%20Twente">Twente</a> and Scottish club <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Heart of Midlothian</a>. The friendship with Nürnberg is the oldest connection between two fan-bases in Germany. Before a match between both clubs, the official club songs are played.
Club songs.
Popular unofficial <a href="football%20chants">chants</a> are
Revierderby.
The Revierderby is the rivalry between local clubs Schalke 04 and <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, both situated in the densely populated <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr region</a>. Because of the small geographical distances between the clubs (roughly 30 kilometers), fans of opposing clubs often meet in everyday life. The term may be used in any match between two football clubs of the Ruhr region (such as <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a>, <a href="Rot-Weiss%20Essen">Rot-Weiss Essen</a> or <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a>), but the term is most commonly associated with the rivalry between Schalke and Dortmund due to the derby's popularity and prestige. To some fans, the win of the derby itself is more important than the actual performance in the Bundesliga.
In popular culture.
Schalke has been subject of a feature-length film called "<a href="Fu%C3%9Fball%20ist%20unser%20Leben">Fußball ist unser Leben</a>" ("Football is our life"). Actors <a href="Uwe%20Ochsenknecht">Uwe Ochsenknecht</a> and <a href="Ralf%20Richter%20%28actor%29">Ralf Richter</a>, both of whom were in the award-winning film "<a href="Das%20Boot">Das Boot</a>", played the main roles, while many persons associated with Schalke had cameo roles, such as manager <a href="Rudi%20Assauer">Rudi Assauer</a>, coaches Huub Stevens and Helmut Schulte, and player Yves Eigenrauch. Also featured were prominent fans like Manfred Breuckmann, Ulrich Potofski or DJ Hooligan. The film is a comedy about "Hans", a Schalke fanatic, and his three pals who somehow get involved in kidnapping and trying to bring back to form the team's new star player "Di Ospeo" and in the process bet Hans' house that their idol will score in the final match.
"Schalke" is mentioned in the film "Das Boot" when the <a href="Boatswain">bosun</a> tells the crew in their ward room, "I got bad news for you men. Schalke lost 5–0, looks like we won't be in the final this year."

1. FC Köln

1. Fußball-Club Köln 01/07 e. V., commonly known as simply FC Köln () or FC Cologne in English, is a German professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, in <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>. It was formed in 1948 as a merger of the clubs "Kölner Ballspiel-Club 1901" and "<a href="SpVgg%20S%C3%BClz%2007">SpVgg Sülz 07</a>". Köln competes in the Bundesliga after promotion in <a href="2018-19%202.%20Bundesliga">2018–19</a> following relegation to <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> <a href="2017-18%20Bundesliga">the previous season</a>. The team are three-time national champions, winning the <a href="1962%20German%20football%20championship">1962 German football championship</a>, as well as the Bundesliga twice, first in its inaugural season of <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Bundesliga">1963–64</a> and then again in <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Bundesliga">1977–78</a>. The team plays its home matches at <a href="RheinEnergieStadion">RheinEnergieStadion</a>.
The club's nickname "Die Geißböcke" (The <a href="Goat">Billy Goats</a>) refers to the club's <a href="mascot">mascot</a>, a male goat named "Hennes" after the veteran FC player and later manager <a href="Hennes%20Weisweiler">Hennes Weisweiler</a>. The first "Hennes" was donated by a circus entrepreneur as a <a href="Cologne%20carnival">Cologne carnival</a> joke. The current mascot is "Hennes" IX as of 1 August 2019 after Hennes VIII was retired by the club due to old age. Another nickname for the club, more common locally due to its ambiguity, is "FC" (often written as "Effzeh"), a common German abbreviation for football clubs. Characteristic for the <a href="Colognian%20language">dialect spoken around Cologne</a>, this is pronounced "EF-tsay", in contrast to the Standard German pronunciation of the abbreviation where the second syllable is emphasized (). Köln play at home in white and red, both colours having been used as the main shirt colour throughout its history. The club has long-standing rivalries with nearby clubs <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>, and <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a>.
Like many of Germany's other professional football clubs, 1. FC Köln is part of a larger sports club with teams in other sports like <a href="handball">handball</a>, <a href="table%20tennis">table tennis</a> and <a href="gymnastics">gymnastics</a>. 1. FC Köln has over 100,000 members, making it the fourth largest club in Germany.
History.
Predecessor sides.
Kölner BC was formed on 6 June 1901 by a group of young men who were unhappy as part of the <a href="gymnastics">gymnastics</a> club FC Borussia Köln and far more interested in football. BC was a competitive side in the Zehnerliga West in the years before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> who took the <a href="Western%20German%20football%20championship">Westdeutsche championship</a> in 1912 and advanced to the preliminary rounds of the <a href="1912%20German%20football%20championship">national finals</a>. Their next best result was a losing appearance in the 1920 league final, where they lost 1–3 to <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>.
Spielvereinigung 1907 Köln-Sülz was established in 1907 as Sülzer Sportverein and on 1 January 1919 merged with Fußball Club 1908 Hertha Sülz to form SpVgg. They won the Westdeutscher title in 1928 and they too went out in the early rounds of the <a href="1928%20German%20football%20championship">national finals</a> in their turn on that stage. They went on to play as a top flight club in the <a href="Gauliga%20Mittelrhein">Gauliga Mittelrhein</a>, one of sixteen premier level divisions established in 1933 in the reorganization of German football under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>. The side earned generally good results through the 1930s – including a divisional championship in 1939 – but then faltered in the early 1940s. After the 1941 season, the Gauliga Mittlerhein was split into two new divisions: the <a href="Gauliga%20K%C3%B6ln-Aachen">Gauliga Köln-Aachen</a> and the <a href="Gauliga%20Moselland">Gauliga Moselland</a>, which included clubs from occupied Luxembourg. Sülz struggled until they were united with <a href="VfL%20K%C3%B6ln%201899">VfL Köln 1899</a> for the 1943–44 season, to form the combined wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft VfL 99/Sülz 07, which promptly won the Gauliga Köln-Aachen title by a single point over SG Düren 99 in a close race. The club did not play the next campaign as war overtook the region.
A successful new club.
After the union of these two predecessor sides (1948), 1. FC Köln began play in the tough <a href="Oberliga%20West%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga West</a> in the 1949–50 season, and, by 1954, had won their first divisional championship. That same year they lost the <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> final 1–0 to <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>. "Die Geißböcke" won their second divisional championship in 1960, and appeared in the <a href="1960%20German%20football%20championship">national final</a> against <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>, where they lost 2–3. In the 1962 and 1963 they went on to finish first in the Oberliga West in each of the next three seasons, and again played their way to the national final. They won the 1962 match 4–0 over <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>, resulting in entry to the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20European%20Cup">1962–63 European Cup</a>, where they were one of the favourites to win the trophy. In the first round, Köln visited <a href="Dundee%20F.C.">Dundee F.C.</a> of Scotland and lost 1–8, and despite winning the second leg back in Germany by 4–0, they were out of the tournament. In the following year's national final, they lost 1–3 to <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>.
Continuing success.
In 1963, FC Köln was selected as one of the original 16 teams to play in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional football league. Köln continued their winning ways by becoming the first <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">Bundesliga champion</a>, in the league's inaugural <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Bundesliga">1963–64 season</a>. As German champions, Köln entered the <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20European%20Cup">1964–65 European Cup</a>, where it met England's <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> at the quarter-final stage. After two 0–0 draws, a third game was played which was also a stalemate, this time 2–2. As the <a href="kicks%20from%20the%20penalty%20mark">penalty shootout</a> had not yet been introduced as the means of deciding a tie, Köln went out of the competition on the <a href="Coin%20toss">toss of a coin</a>. Ironically enough, there was the need for a second coin toss because the first time the coin stuck vertically in the ground. The club also became the first Bundesliga side to field a Brazilian player, when it signed <a href="Z%C3%A9z%C3%A9%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201942%29">Zézé</a> for a then club record fee of <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">DM</a> 150,000. Domestically, Köln recorded a second-place finish in the <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20Bundesliga">1964–65 Bundesliga</a> season and won its first <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20DFB-Pokal">1967–68</a>.
At the start of the 1970s, Köln reached three DFB-Pokal finals in four seasons, losing all three; to <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a> in <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20DFB-Pokal">1970</a>, <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20DFB-Pokal">1971</a> and <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20DFB-Pokal">1973</a>. The team also achieved another second place Bundesliga finish in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Bundesliga">1973</a>, before reaching another DFB-Pokal final in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20DFB-Pokal">1977</a>, beating <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> over two legs to win the trophy for the second time.
In 1977–78, FC Köln enjoyed its most successful season, winning the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> title, its third national title overall, and retaining the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. This makes Köln one of only four clubs to have won <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23Germany">the double</a> in <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23Bundesliga%20era">the Bundesliga era</a>.
Köln had another losing DFB-Pokal final appearance in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20DFB-Pokal">1980</a>, before winning the competition for a fourth time in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20DFB-Pokal">1983</a>. In 1986, the club appeared in its first European final, losing 5–3 on aggregate to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> in the <a href="1986%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">UEFA Cup Final</a>. Two second place Bundesliga finishes, in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Bundesliga">1988–89</a> and <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Bundesliga">1989–90</a>, and another DFB-Pokal final loss in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20DFB-Pokal">1991</a>, marked the end of a glorious thirty-year period for FC Köln.
21st century: ups and downs.
In recent years, the club's performance has been mixed. The FC holds the dubious distinction of the worst goal drought in Bundesliga history: in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Bundesliga">2002</a>, the supporters had to wait 1034 excruciating minutes (equivalent to 11-and-a-half games) until <a href="Thomas%20Cichon">Thomas Cichon</a> found the back of the net again.
In the early years of the Bundesliga, 1. FC Köln was the most successful club in West Germany in terms of total points won. Beginning in the early 1990s, however, the club's performance declined, and in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Bundesliga">1998</a> it was relegated for the first time. Since about 2000, the side has been a "<a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo team</a>", moving between the first and second divisions. It returned to the Bundesliga at the end of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%202.%20Bundesliga">2004–05 season</a>, as <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> champions, after having been relegated the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Bundesliga">season before</a>. There was little optimism about their return to the top flight, as they were picked by German football magazine "kicker" as one of the clubs most likely to be relegated.
This prediction came true when Köln lost to <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> 1–0 in the third-to-last match of <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">the season</a>. The club finished the season in second-last place and was relegated after conceding a league-worst 71 goals. The team's most prolific goal scorer was <a href="Lukas%20Podolski">Lukas Podolski</a> with a total of 12 goals, who transferred to Bayern Munich after the end of the season. He also appeared with the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany national team</a> at the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>.
In late 2006, former coach <a href="Christoph%20Daum">Christoph Daum</a> was convinced to once again take the helm of the 2. Bundesliga club, and succeeded in leading the club back to the Bundesliga in 2008. After a successful Bundesliga campaign in 2008–09, Daum left Köln for his former club <a href="Fenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K.%20%28football%29">Fenerbahçe</a>. Köln's former star-striker Lukas Podolski returned for the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Bundesliga">2009–10 season</a>.
After a poor run of form in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a>, recording only one win from its opening nine Bundesliga fixtures, Köln replaced coach <a href="Zvonimir%20Soldo">Zvonimir Soldo</a> with <a href="Frank%20Schaefer%20%28football%20manager%29">Frank Schaefer</a>. Schaefer, who was originally in charge of the under-23 team of Köln, decided after the season that he would rather spend more time with his family than be a coach in the Bundesliga. Former <a href="Norway%20national%20football%20team">Norwegian international</a> and recent <a href="F.C.%20Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> coach <a href="St%C3%A5le%20Solbakken">Ståle Solbakken</a> replaced him. After earning just eight points in the first 13 matches of the second half of the season, Schaefer and former Köln player <a href="Dirk%20Lottner">Dirk Lottner</a> replaced Solbakken. The club, however, was relegated at the end of the season, finishing in 17th place, having accumulated €33m debt, and €11m <a href="equity%20%28finance%29">negative equity</a>.
Turnaround (2012–2017).
In April 2012, the club members elected a new board of directors, Werner Spinner as president, Markus Ritterbach for marketing, and <a href="Harald%20Schumacher">Toni Schumacher</a> for sport. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%202.%20Bundesliga">2012–13 season</a>, under new trainer <a href="Holger%20Stanislawski">Holger Stanislawski</a>, Köln finished in fifth place in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, missing out on promotion back to the top division.
In 2012 the board hired Jörg Jakobs as director of football, who then got promoted in 2014 to sporting director, chief scout and director of the academy. In January 2013, <a href="Alexander%20Wehrle">Alexander Wehrle</a> joined as managing director of FC Köln ltd. Wehrle was working as assistant for <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> president Erwin Staudt, especially for rebuilding the stadium. In summer 2013, <a href="Peter%20St%C3%B6ger">Peter Stöger</a> and Manfred Schmid were hired as coaching team, and Jörg Schmadtke as general manager. <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%202.%20Bundesliga">2013–14</a> Köln finished first in the 2. Bundesliga and earned promotion to the top division. It was followed by a 12th place <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15</a>, ninth in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16</a>, and fifth place in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Bundesliga">2016–17</a>. 25 years after the club's last appearance in international football to date they qualified for the Europa League. After restructuring and repaying debt, equity turned from €11m negative to €20m positive. The turnover increased from €56m in 2012/13 to more than €120m in 2016/17.
Decline and changes (2018–).
After the club's return the European stage, fortunes quickly changed. The team experienced an unsuccessful start to the <a href="2017-18%20Bundesliga">2017–18 Bundesliga season</a> gaining only three points from its first sixteen matches. At the same time, the club's Europa League campaign ended after the group stage. This downtrend led to the resignation of <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Schmadtke">Jörg Schmadtke</a> and Stöger's dismissal in December 2017; he was replaced by <a href="Stefan%20Ruthenbeck">Stefan Ruthenbeck</a>, who was appointed as caretaker manager. In spite of an improved record in the second half of the season, the team finished last and were relegated to <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> at the end of the year.
Ahead of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%202.%20Bundesliga">2018–19 season</a>, <a href="Markus%20Anfang">Markus Anfang</a> was appointed manager with a mandate to achieve an immediate return to the top flight. While the club occupied the league's top spot for much of the season, Anfang was let go after a winless streak in April 2019. Just a week later, with André Pawlak at the helm, the team achieved promotion with a 0–4 victory over <a href="Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">Greuther Fürth</a>. On 13 May 2019, the club announced that <a href="Jahn%20Regensburg">Jahn Regensburg</a> manager <a href="Achim%20Beierlorzer">Achim Beierlorzer</a> would assume its vacant head coaching position from the <a href="2019-20%20Bundesliga">upcoming season</a>. He was signed to a contract until 2021. Following an unsuccessful start to the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bundesliga">2019–20 season</a>, which included a 3–2 cup defeat against <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a>, the club decided to terminate Beierlorzer's contract on 9 November 2019. Sporting director <a href="Armin%20Veh">Armin Veh</a>, who weeks earlier had announced that he would not extend his contract with the club, was also dismissed from his position. On 18 November, former <a href="Hamburger%20SV">HSV</a> manager <a href="Markus%20Gisdol">Markus Gisdol</a> was appointed to the club's head coaching position, while <a href="Horst%20Heldt">Horst Heldt</a> was made sporting director. Both signed contracts until 2021. After avoiding relegation at the end of the season, Gisdol's contract was extended until 2023. 
The club found itself in a renewed relegation during the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Bundesliga">2020–21 season</a>. On 11 April 2021, after losing to relegation rival <a href="Mainz%2005">Mainz 05</a>, Gisdol was dismissed from his position as head coach. The next day, it was announced that <a href="Friedhelm%20Funkel">Friedhelm Funkel</a> would take over head coaching duties until the end of the season. On 11 May, it was reported that SC Paderborn manager <a href="Steffen%20Baumgart">Steffen Baumgart</a> would succeed Funkel as head coach at the beginning of the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Bundesliga">2021–22 season</a>. Funkel's side faced <a href="Holstein%20Kiel">Holstein Kiel</a> in the relegation playoffs. After losing 0–1 at home, his team recorded a 1–5 away win, enabling the club to retain its position in the Bundesliga. On 1 April 2022, the club appointed <a href="Christian%20Keller%20%28sports%20administrator%29">Christian Keller</a> as its new managing director, a position that had been vacant since the dismissal of Heldt in May 2021.
In March 2023, during the second half of the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Bundesliga">2022–23 campaign</a>, Köln were put under a two-window transfer embargo by <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>'s Dispute Resolution Chamber, having been found guilty of inducing a breach of contract without <a href="Just%20cause%20%28employment%20law%29">just cause</a> while signing <a href="Jaka%20%C4%8Cuber%20Poto%C4%8Dnik">Jaka Čuber Potočnik</a> from <a href="NK%20Olimpija%20Ljubljana">Olimpija Ljubljana</a> in January 2022. As part of the same verdict, the club was also sentenced to pay Ljubljana a <a href="Euro">€</a>51,750 compensation, in addition to training costs. Köln ultimately appealed the decision at the <a href="Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport">Court of Arbitration for Sport</a> in <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>.
Stadium.
The team plays its home matches in the <a href="M%C3%BCngersdorfer%20Stadion">Müngersdorfer Stadion</a>, also known as the RheinEnergie Stadion for sponsorship purposes. It has a seating capacity of 50,000 and the average attendance in the 2015–16 season was 48,676. The stadium sponsorship comes from a contract with the local power supplier RheinEnergie AG. However, most fans still call the stadium "Müngersdorfer Stadion", named after the suburb of Müngersdorf, where it is located.
The club owns the "Geißbockheim" training centre, currently known as "RheinEnergieSportpark" for sponsorship, located in <a href="S%C3%BClz">Sülz</a>, which is a municipal part of Köln in the southwest of the city. The centre is home to the "Franz-Kremer-Stadion" the home of <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln%20II">1. FC Köln II</a>.
Kits.
Köln's kits are made by <a href="Hummel%20International">Hummel International</a>, who pay the club €20m over a five-year span.
Rivals.
The club's main rivals are <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a>, and <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a> – all clubs from the same <a href="Rhine-Ruhr">Rhine-Ruhr</a> region, near the river <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>.
Women's section.
The women's team was promoted to the <a href="Frauen-Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 2015. They were directly relegated back to the <a href="2.%20Frauen-Bundesliga">2. Frauen-Bundesliga</a> after the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Frauen-Bundesliga">2016–17</a> season ended, but managed to regain promotion in May 2017 to the Bundesliga.

Bayer 04 Leverkusen

Bayer 04 Leverkusen (), officially known as Bayer 04 Leverkusen Fußball GmbH and also known as Bayer Leverkusen or simply Leverkusen, is a professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Leverkusen">Leverkusen</a>, <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>, Germany. The club competes in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, the top tier of <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football</a>, and plays its home matches at the <a href="BayArena">BayArena</a>.
The club was founded in 1904 by employees of the German pharmaceutical company <a href="Bayer">Bayer AG</a>, whose headquarters are in Leverkusen and from which the club draws its name. It was formerly the best-known department of TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen, a <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> whose members also participate in athletics, gymnastics, <a href="Bayer%20Giants%20Leverkusen">basketball</a>, field handball and other sports including the <a href="RTHC%20Bayer%20Leverkusen">RTHC Bayer Leverkusen</a> (rowing, tennis and hockey). In 1999, the football department was separated from the sports club and is now a separate entity formally called Bayer 04 Leverkusen Fußball GmbH. Bayer were first promoted to the Bundesliga in 1979, and have remained in the top division ever since. The club's main colours are red and black, both having been used as the main shirt colour and with red and black stripes also having been used as home colours.
Bayer Leverkusen have finished as runner-up in the Bundesliga five times without winning the competition, a record in German football. The club has won one <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> and one <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>. Bayer also finished runner-up in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2001–02 UEFA Champions League</a>, losing 2–1 to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> in the <a href="2002%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">final</a>. Their local rivals are <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>, <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> and <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>.
History.
Origins and early years.
On 27 November 1903, Wilhelm Hauschild wrote a letter – signed by 170 of his fellow workers – to his employer, the <a href="Bayer">Friedrich Bayer and Co.</a>, seeking the company's support in starting a sports club. The company agreed to support the initiative, and on 1 July 1904 "Turn- und Spielverein Bayer 04 Leverkusen" was founded. On 31 May 1907, a separate football department was formed within the club. In the culture of sports in Germany at the time, there was significant animosity between gymnasts and other types of athletes. Eventually this contributed to a split within the club: on 8 June 1928, the footballers formed a separate association – "Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen" – that also included the handball and fistball players, athletics, and boxing, while the gymnasts carried on as "TuS Bayer 04 Leverkusen". "SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen" took with them the club's traditional colours of red and black, with the gymnasts adopting blue and yellow.
Through this period, and into the 1930s, SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen played third and fourth division football. In 1936, they earned promotion to the second highest class of play of the period. That was also the year that the club wore the familiar "Bayer" cross for the first time. They made their first appearance in upper league play in 1951, in the <a href="Oberliga%20West%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga West</a> and played there until 1956, after which they were relegated.
"SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen" would not return to the upper leagues until 1962, just one season before the formation of Germany's new professional league, the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. The next year saw the club in the <a href="Regionalliga%20West%20%281963%E2%80%9374%29">Regionalliga West</a>, tier II, where their performances over the next few seasons left them well down the league table.
2. Bundesliga to Bundesliga, UEFA Cup, and DFB-Pokal.
SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen made something of a breakthrough in 1968 by winning the division title, but was unable to advance through the playoff round to the first division. The club was relegated again in 1973, but made a quick return to what was now called the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> after just one season spent in the third division. Four years later, the club handily secured a place in the Bundesliga to start to play there in the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Bundesliga">1979–80 season.</a>
By the mid-1980s, SV Bayer 04 Leverkusen had played its way into the upper half of the league table and was well-established there by the end of the decade. It was during this time, in 1984, that the two halves of the club that had parted ways over a half century earlier were re-united as TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen e.V. The new club took red and white as its colours.
In addition to becoming an established Bundesliga side, the club earned its first honours with a dramatic win in the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20UEFA%20Cup">1988 UEFA Cup</a>. Down 0–3 to <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">Espanyol</a> after the first leg of the final, Bayer Leverkusen drew even in the return match and then captured the title on penalty kicks, 3–2.
That same year, long-time Bayer Leverkusen executive Reiner Calmund became the general manager of the club. This is regarded as one of the most important moves in the club's history, as Calmund ushered in a decade and a half of the club's greatest successes through shrewd, far-sighted player acquisitions.
After the <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a> in 1990, Reiner Calmund was quick to sign <a href="East%20Germany">East German</a> stars <a href="Ulf%20Kirsten">Ulf Kirsten</a>, <a href="Andreas%20Thom">Andreas Thom</a> and <a href="Jens%20Melzig">Jens Melzig</a>. The three players would become instant crowd favourites, and make significant contributions to the team. Calmund also established groundbreaking contacts in <a href="Football%20in%20Brazil">Brazilian football</a>, befriending Juan Figer, one of Brazil's most powerful <a href="Sports%20agent%23Association%20football">player agents</a>. Over the next few years, budding superstars, such as <a href="Jorginho%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201964%29">Jorginho</a> and <a href="Paulo%20S%C3%A9rgio%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201969%29">Paulo Sérgio</a>, joined the team, as did Czech star <a href="Pavel%20Hapal">Pavel Hapal</a>. The club also signed charismatic players, such as <a href="Bernd%20Schuster">Bernd Schuster</a>, and <a href="Rudi%20V%C3%B6ller">Rudi Völler</a>, helping to ensure the team's popularity and growing success.
The club captured its next honour in 1993 with a 1–0 win in the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> over a surprising <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> amateur squad on 12 June 1993. In the following season, in a game also known for its 45 m "German Goal of the Year" by Schuster (a goal which was later also named "Goal of the Decade"), Bayer played <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> early in the season, and, as both a "tip of the hat" to its own history as well as an attempt to perhaps upset the Frankfurt team, Bayer played in its new third colours, which were old-fashioned red and black stripes, similar jerseys to those Frankfurt generally wore at the time. This proved so popular with the fans that, very shortly thereafter, the team reverted to its "retro" colours of red and black, colours used on all home jerseys ever since.
After a near disaster in 1996 when the club faced a relegation battle, Bayer Leverkusen established itself as a powerful side, offering a technically pleasing offensive style of play under new coach <a href="Christoph%20Daum">Christoph Daum</a>, who was also helped by the signing of players such as <a href="L%C3%BAcio">Lúcio</a>, <a href="Emerson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201976%29">Emerson</a>, <a href="Z%C3%A9%20Roberto">Zé Roberto</a> and <a href="Michael%20Ballack">Michael Ballack</a>. Daum was later to be famously fired for a <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> scandal that also cost him his ascent to the role of the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany national team</a> coach.
The Nearly Men.
The team earned a series of four-second-place finishes from 1997 to 2002. The finishes of 2000 and 2002 were heart-breaking for supporters, as on both occasions the team had the Bundesliga title within its grasp. In 2000, Bayer Leverkusen needed only a draw against <a href="SpVgg%20Unterhaching">SpVgg Unterhaching</a> to win the title, but an own goal by Michael Ballack helped send the team to a crushing 2–0 defeat, while <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> won the title with a 3–1 victory over <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>. Two years later, the club surrendered a five-point lead atop the league table by losing two of its last three matches, while <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> swept ahead with three consecutive victories in its final matches. The 2002 season has been dubbed the "Treble Horror", as Bayer Leverkusen were also beaten 4–2 in the <a href="2002%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">DFB-Pokal final</a> by <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> and lost the <a href="2002%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">UEFA Champions League final</a> 2–1 to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>, which also led to some of the English-language media dubbing them "<a href="Neverkusen">Neverkusen</a>". Leverkusen was the first team to reach the final of the Champions League without ever having won a national championship. In addition, five members of the Bayer Leverkusen team were also members of the Germany national team which lost the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20final">final of the World Cup of 2002</a>.
Recent years.
The club went through startling reversals of fortune in the next two seasons. In the 2002 off-season, the team lost influential midfield stars Michael Ballack and Zé Roberto to archrivals Bayern Munich. The team then flirted with <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a> through most of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Bundesliga">2002–03 season</a>, leading to the firing of <a href="Klaus%20Toppm%C3%B6ller">Klaus Toppmöller</a>, who had coached the team during its most successful year, and he was replaced by the inexperenced Thomas Hörster. Charismatic coach <a href="Klaus%20Augenthaler">Klaus Augenthaler</a> took up the reins in the last two games of the season and helped avoid disaster with a win over his previous club, <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>. He then led Bayer Leverkusen to a third-place finish and a Champions League place the following year.
That following season's run in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> saw the club get some measure of revenge on Real Madrid, opening its group stage campaign with a 3–0 rout of the Spanish giants, a result which helped Leverkusen to win the group. Leverkusen, however, was defeated in the first knockout round by eventual champions <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. The club finished sixth during the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Bundesliga">2004–05 season</a> to qualify for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">next season's UEFA Cup</a>.
Early in 2005, Augenthaler was fired as manager after the club got off to its worst Bundesliga start in over 20 years, with only one win in its first four league matches and a 0–1 home loss to <a href="PFC%20CSKA%20Sofia">CSKA Sofia</a> in the first leg of its UEFA Cup match-up. Former Germany national team manager Rudi Völler, who had been named sporting director prior to the season, took charge of five matches as <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker manager</a>. <a href="Michael%20Skibbe">Michael Skibbe</a>, who was Völler's assistant coach with the national team, was named as his successor in October 2005. Skibbe turned Leverkusen's season around, and guided the club to a sixth-place finish in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2006</a>, earning another <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> place, and then repeated that feat with a fifth place <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> finish in 2007.
The <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a> was not a successful one for Leverkusen despite a good start to the season; five out of the last ten league matches were lost to clubs in the lower half of the table. Michael Skibbe was heavily criticised towards the end of the season after he continuously changed his starting line up. Bayer Leverkusen also lost a lot of its support towards the end of the season: in the 1–2 home loss against Hertha BSC, the Leverkusen fans caused much commotion, with fans chanting for the sacking of Skibbe, while some Ultras, who had seen enough, set fire to their jerseys and threw them onto the field. Michael Skibbe was sacked soon thereafter, leaving the club on 21 May 2008, with club officials stating that his departure was due to the team not qualifying for the following season's <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> group stage.
The <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Bundesliga">2008–09 season</a> got off to a great start for Bayer Leverkusen under new manager <a href="Bruno%20Labbadia">Bruno Labbadia</a>, who the club had acquired from 2. Bundesliga club <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">SpVgg Greuther Fürth</a>. As the season progressed, however, the team secured no wins against top clubs in the Bundesliga. However, Leverkusen reached the <a href="2009%20DFB-Pokal%20final">DFB-Pokal final</a> on 30 May 2009 in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, but lost the game 0–1 to Werder Bremen. Leverkusen finished the season in ninth place in the Bundesliga table and Labbadia moved to <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> in June 2009. Shortly thereafter, Leverkusen presented <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a>, who had previously managed Bayern Munich after <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann">Jürgen Klinsmann</a>'s departure, as its new manager. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11</a> season, Bayer Leverkusen finished as runner-up, thus qualifying for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> for the first time since <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2005</a>. However, Heynckes decided not to extend his contract and left Bayer Leverkusen in the 2011 close season to take over at Bayern Munich for a third time. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13</a> and <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16</a> seasons, Leverkusen finished third with coach <a href="Sami%20Hyypi%C3%A4">Sami Hyypiä</a> and <a href="Roger%20Schmidt%20%28football%20manager%29">Roger Schmidt</a> respectively, but were knocked out in the round of 16 of the Champions League the following season both times. In the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2019–20 UEFA Europa League</a>, Leverkusen reached the quarter-finals for the first time since <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">2008</a>, but were ultimately knocked out by <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> in a 2–1 loss.
During the 2023–24 season, Bayer 04 Leverkusen have experienced a remarkable transformation under the guidance of head coach <a href="Xabi%20Alonso">Xabi Alonso</a>. Appointed in October 2022, Alonso's tenure saw the team achieve significant milestones both domestically and in European competitions. By early 2024, Leverkusen have set a new club record for the longest unbeaten start to a season.
Alonso's strategic signings and effective squad building has played a critical role. Notable additions included <a href="Switzerland%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a> captain <a href="Granit%20Xhaka">Granit Xhaka</a>, <a href="Jonas%20Hofmann">Jonas Hofmann</a>, <a href="%C3%81lex%20Grimaldo">Alejandro Grimaldo</a>, and <a href="Victor%20Boniface">Victor Boniface</a>, who collectively enhanced the team's depth and versatility.
Club culture.
In contrast to many other German football clubs, which hold close ties to their working-class roots, Bayer Leverkusen strives for a clean, family-friendly image. The <a href="BayArena">BayArena</a> has the reputation of being one of the most family-friendly football stadiums in Germany. Ironically, Bayer 04 was the first Bundesliga club whose fans identified themselves as "<a href="Ultras">Ultras</a>" and the city of Leverkusen is one of the old industrial cities of Germany.
Bayer Leverkusen is perceived by some to have an ongoing image problem of a different sort. Although they are a financially healthy club with a stable of strong players, many fans of the traditional clubs denounce Bayer Leverkusen as being a "plastic club" without traditions or a committed fan base, existing solely as a creation of their rich pharmaceutical company sponsor – <a href="Bayer%20AG">Bayer AG</a>. As a result, the club and their fans have started to emphasize their industrial origins with pride, calling themselves "Werkself" (Eng. "Factory team", "Millhanders") or "Pillendreher" (Eng. "Tablet twisters").
Bayer Leverkusen's corporate origins, however, are far from unique. Other clubs, including <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a>, <a href="FC%20Carl%20Zeiss%20Jena">Carl Zeiss Jena</a> and <a href="FC%20Sochaux-Montb%C3%A9liard">Sochaux</a>, share a similar reputation of being <a href="works%20team">works team</a>s. As distinguished from the various <a href="Red%20Bull">Red Bull</a> teams (<a href="FC%20Red%20Bull%20Salzburg">Salzburg</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Red%20Bulls">New York</a> and <a href="RB%20Leipzig">Leipzig</a>) which has been established or redefined in the recent past primarily for commercial reasons, the formation of Bayer Leverkusen was motivated by the idea of promoting the living conditions of local factory workers early in the 20th century. In view of this tradition, UEFA allows Bayer Leverkusen to use the brand name Bayer in European club competitions while disallowing such naming practices most notably to Red Bull Salzburg.
Charity.
In March 2020, Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, and RB Leipzig, the four German UEFA Champions League teams for the 2019–20 season, collectively gave €20 million to Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams that were struggling financially during the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>.

VfL Bochum is one of the oldest sports organizations in the world, claiming an origin date of 26 July 1848 when an article in the "Märkischer Sprecher" – a local newspaper – called for the creation of a gymnastics club. The Turnverein zu Bochum was then formally established on 18 February 1849. The club was banned on 28 December 1852 for political reasons, then reestablished on 19 June 1860. The club was reorganized in May 1904 as Turnverein zu Bochum, gegründet 1848 and formed a <a href="association%20football">football</a> department on 31 January 1911. On 1 April 1919, the club merged with <a href="TuS%20Bochum">Spiel und Sport 08 Bochum</a> to form Turn- und Sportverein Bochum 1848. On 1 February 1924, the two clubs from the earlier merger split into the Bochumer Turnverein 1848 (gymnastics department) and <a href="TuS%20Bochum">Turn- und Sportverein Bochum 1908</a> (<a href="association%20football">football</a>, <a href="track%20and%20field">track and field</a>, <a href="Team%20handball">handball</a>, <a href="field%20hockey">hockey</a> and tennis departments).
The <a href="Nazis">Nazi regime</a> forced Bochumer Turnverein 1848 to merge with Turn- und Sport Bochum 1908 and <a href="Germania%20Bochum">Sportverein Germania Vorwärts Bochum 1906</a> into the current-day club VfL Bochum on 14 April 1938. After the merger, VfL Bochum continued to compete in the top flight as part of the <a href="Gauliga%20Westfalen">Gauliga Westfalen</a>.
As <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> progressed, play throughout Germany became increasingly difficult due to player shortages, travel problems and damage to football fields from Allied bombing raids. VfL became part of the wartime side Kriegsspielgemeinschaft VfL 1848/Preußen Bochum alongside Preußen 07 Bochum, before re-emerging as a separate side again after the war. Although they fielded competitive sides, they had the misfortune of playing in the same division as <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, which was the dominant team of the era. VfL's best result was therefore a distant second place in 1938–39.
Postwar and entry to Bundesliga play.
Following World War II, the football section resumed play as the independent VfL Bochum 1848 and played its first season in the second division 2. Oberliga West in 1949, while Preußen Bochum went on to lower tier amateur level play. VfL won the division title in 1953 to advance to the Oberliga West for a single season. They repeated their divisional win in 1956 and returned to the top-flight until again being relegated after the 1960–61 season.
With the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional league, in 1963 VfL found itself in the third tier Amateurliga Westfalen. A first-place result there in 1965 raised them to the Regionalliga West (II), from which they began a steady climb up the league table to the Bundesliga in 1971. During this rise, Bochum also played its way to the final of the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20DFB-Pokal">1967–68 DFB-Pokal</a>, where they lost 1–4 to <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>.
In spite of being a perennial lower table side, Bochum developed a reputation for tenaciousness on the field in a run of 20 seasons in the top flight. The club made a repeat appearance in the DFB-Pokal final in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20DFB-Pokal">1988</a>, losing 0–1 to <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>. Relegated after a 16th-place finish in the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Bundesliga">1992–93 season</a>, the team has become a classic "<a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo club</a>", bouncing up and down between the Bundesliga and <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>. The club finished in 5th place in the Bundesliga in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Bundesliga">1996–97</a> and <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Bundesliga">2003–04</a>, which earned them appearances in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>. In <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20UEFA%20Cup">1997</a>, they advanced to the third round, where they were eliminated by <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>, and in 2004, they were eliminated early through <a href="away%20goals">away goals</a> (0–0 and 1–1) by <a href="Standard%20Li%C3%A8ge">Standard Liège</a>.
In the 2020–21 season, the club won the 2. Bundesliga, earning promotion to the Bundesliga.
Current.
Today's sports club has 5,000 members, with the football department accounting for over 2,200 of these.

Stadium.
<a href="Ruhrstadion">Ruhrstadion</a> (also known as the <a href="Vonovia">Vonovia</a> Ruhrstadion under a sponsorship deal) was one of the first modern football-only stadiums in Germany. It was built in the 1970s on the traditional ground of TuS Bochum 08 at the Castroper Straße, north of the city centre.

Hamburger SV

Hamburger Sport-Verein e.V. (), commonly known as Hamburger SV () or Hamburg (), is a German <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> based in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, with its largest branch being its <a href="Association%20football">football</a> department. Though the current HSV was founded in June 1919 from a merger of three earlier clubs, it traces its origins to 29 September 1887 when the first of the predecessors, <a href="SC%20Germania%20Hamburg">SC Germania</a>, was founded.
HSV has won the <a href="Bundesliga">German national championship</a> six times, the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> three times and the former <a href="DFL-Ligapokal">League Cup</a> twice. The team's most successful period was from the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s when, in addition to several domestic honours, they won the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1976–77 European Cup Winners' Cup</a> and the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20European%20Cup">1982–83 European Cup</a>.

To date, HSV's last major trophy was the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20DFB-Pokal">1986–87 DFB-Pokal</a>. Up until the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Bundesliga">2017–18 Bundesliga season</a>, which found the team relegated for the first time in history, HSV's football team had the distinction of being the only team that had <a href="List%20of%20unrelegated%20association%20football%20clubs">played continuously in the top tier</a> of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a> since the founding of the club at the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. It was subsequently the only team that had played in every season of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> since its foundation in 1963.
HSV play their home games at the <a href="Volksparkstadion">Volksparkstadion</a> in <a href="Bahrenfeld">Bahrenfeld</a>, a western district of Hamburg. The club colours are officially blue, white and black but the home kit of the team is white jerseys and red shorts. The team's most common nickname is "die Rothosen" (the Red Shorts). As it is one of Germany's oldest clubs, it is also known as "der Dinosaurier" (the Dinosaur).

History.
Early years.
Hamburger Sport-Verein (HSV) traces its origin to the merger of "Der Hohenfelder Sportclub" and "Wandsbek-Marienthaler Sportclub" on 29 September 1887 to form <a href="SC%20Germania%20Hamburg">Sport-Club Germania Hamburg</a>, usually referred to as "SC Germania". This was the first of three clubs that merged on 2 June 1919 to create HSV in its present form. HSV in its club statute recognises the founding of SC Germania as its own date of origin. The other two clubs in the June 1919 merger were "Hamburger FC" founded in 1888 and "FC Falke Eppendorf" dating back to 1906. The merger came about because the three clubs had been severely weakened by the impact of the First World War on manpower and finance, and they could not continue as separate entities.
SC Germania was formed originally as an athletics club, and did not begin to play football until 1891, when some Englishmen joined the club and introduced it. SC Germania had its first success in 1896, winning the Hamburg-Altona championship for the first of five times. Germania player emigrated to Brazil at the end of the 19th century, in the foundation of <a href="SC%20Internacional%20%28SP%29">SC Internacional</a>, the third oldest club of the country which became part of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20FC">São Paulo FC</a>, one of the major sports clubs of Brazil, in 1938 and SC Germânia of São Paulo, which later became <a href="EC%20Pinheiros">EC Pinheiros</a>.
Hamburger SC 1888 was founded by students on 1 June 1888. It later had links with a youth team called FC Viktoria 95 and, during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, was temporarily known as Viktoria Hamburg 88. SC Germania and Hamburger SC 1888 were among 86 clubs who founded the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB; German Football Association) in Leipzig on 28 January 1900. FC Falke was founded by students in <a href="Hamburg-Eppendorf">Eppendorf</a> on 5 March 1906, but it was never a successful team and played in lower leagues.
The newly formed Hamburger SV contested in the <a href="1922%20German%20football%20championship">1922 national final</a> against <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>, who were playing for their third consecutive title. The game was called off on account of darkness after three hours and ten minutes of play, drawn at 2–2. The re-match also went into extra time, and in an era that did not allow for substitutions, that game was called off at 2–2 when Nuremberg were reduced to just seven players (two were injured, two had been <a href="Ejection%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football">sent off</a>) and the referee ruled they could not continue. Considerable wrangling ensued over the decision. The DFB awarded the win to HSV, but urged them to refuse the title in the name of good sportsmanship (which they grudgingly did). Ultimately, the Viktoria trophy was not officially presented that year.
HSV's first success was achieved in the <a href="1923%20German%20football%20championship">1923 German football championship</a>, when they won the national title against <a href="1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">Union Oberschöneweide</a>. They lost the title in <a href="1924%20German%20football%20championship">1924</a>, losing the final to Nuremberg. They lifted the Viktoria again in <a href="1928%20German%20football%20championship">1928</a>, when they defeated <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> 5–2 at the <a href="Altonaer%20Stadion">Altonaer Stadion</a> in the final.
During the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>, HSV had local success in the <a href="Gauliga%20Nordmark">Gauliga Nordmark</a>, also known as the Gauliga Hamburg, winning the <a href="Gauliga%20Nordmark%23Winners%20and%20runners-up%20of%20the%20Gauliga">league championship</a> in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941 and 1945. At national level the club was unsuccessful, with semi-final losses in <a href="1938%20German%20football%20championship">1938</a> and <a href="1939%20German%20football%20championship">1939</a> their best performances in this period. Its main rival in the <a href="Gauliga">Gauliga</a> in those years was <a href="Eimsb%C3%BCtteler%20TV">Eimsbütteler TV</a>.
Post-war era.
HSV's first post-war season was in the newly formed <a href="Stadtliga%20Hamburg">Stadtliga Hamburg</a>, and they won its championship in 1946. The club also won the championship of the British occupation zone in 1947 and 1948, the only two seasons this competition was staged.
In May 1950, HSV became the first German team to tour the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and came away with a 6–0 record.
Playing in the <a href="Oberliga%20Nord%20%281947%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Nord</a> after the resumption of league play in post-war <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> in 1947, HSV became a dominant regional club. In 16 seasons from 1947 to 1948 to 1962–63, they won the Oberliga title 15 times, only posting an 11th-place finish in 1953–54. During this period, they scored over 100 goals in each of the 1951, 1955, 1961 and 1962 seasons. In 1953, the club's all-time leading goalscorer <a href="Uwe%20Seeler">Uwe Seeler</a> debuted. In nine seasons, he scored 267 goals in 237 Oberliga matches.
In 1956, HSV reached the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> final, but were beaten by <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a>. This was followed by losses in the finals of the national championship to <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, in <a href="1957%20German%20football%20championship">1957</a>, and <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, in <a href="1958%20German%20football%20championship">1958</a>.
In <a href="1960%20German%20football%20championship">1960</a>, HSV became German champions for the first time since 1928, defeating <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> 3–2 in the championship final. Seeler, who scored twice in the final, was named <a href="Footballer%20of%20the%20Year%20in%20Germany">West German Footballer of the Year</a>.
As national champions, HSV represented West Germany in the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup">1960–61 European Cup</a>. The club's first ever match in European competition was a 5–0 defeat of Swiss club <a href="BSC%20Young%20Boys">Young Boys</a> in <a href="Bern">Bern</a>, with HSV winning the tie 8–3 on aggregate. In the quarter-finals, they beat <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">English champions</a> <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> before being defeated by <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> at the semi-final stage in a playoff game after the scores were level over two legs. The crowd of 77,600 at the <a href="Volksparkstadion">Volksparkstadion</a> for the first leg against Barcelona remains the record attendance for a HSV home match.
Entry into the Bundesliga.
Germany's first professional football league, the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, was formed, with HSV one of 16 clubs invited to join that first season. Hamburger SV was the only original Bundesliga side to have played continuously in the top flight – without ever having been relegated – from when the league was formed in 1963, until they were relegated in the 2017–18 season, finishing in 17th place. They had shared that special status with <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> and <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> until <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Bundesliga">1996</a>, and with 1. FC Köln until <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Bundesliga">1998</a>. The Bundesliga celebrated its 40th anniversary on 24 August 2004 with a match between "The Dinosaur", as the club has been nicknamed due to its old age, and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, the league's most successful side.
In August 1963, HSV defeated Borussia Dortmund 3–0 at <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>'s <a href="Niedersachsenstadion">Niedersachsenstadion</a> to win the club's first <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. In the same month, the club played its first <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> match, drawing 1–1 with <a href="SC%20Preu%C3%9Fen%20M%C3%BCnster">Preußen Münster</a>. HSV finished the Bundesliga's first season in sixth place, with Uwe Seeler scoring 30 goals to secure the "<a href="List%20of%20Bundesliga%20top%20scorers">Torjägerkanone</a>". He was also named <a href="Footballer%20of%20the%20Year%20in%20Germany">Footballer of the Year</a> for the second time. The DFB-Pokal victory enabled HSV to play in the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1963–64 European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, where they reached the quarter-final, falling to <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a>.
In 1967, HSV again reached the final of the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> where they were defeated 4–0 by Bayern Munich. HSV, however, were admitted to the following season's <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, where they lost to <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> in the final.

He retired at the end of the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Bundesliga">1971–72 season</a> in front of 72,000 fans at the Volksparkstadion. He ended his career with 137 goals from 239 Bundesliga matches and 507 goals from 587 appearances in all competitions. In the same season, HSV played in the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> for the first time, but were knocked out in the first round by Scottish side <a href="St%20Johnstone%20F.C.">St Johnstone</a>.
Golden era.
In 1973, HSV won the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20DFB-Ligapokal">first edition</a> of the <a href="DFB-Ligapokal">DFB-Ligapokal</a>, beating <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> 4–0 in the final.

After spending much of the previous decade in mid-table, HSV achieved their best Bundesliga position in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Bundesliga">1974–75</a> by finishing fourth. The club bettered this in <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Bundesliga">1975–76</a>, with a second-place finish. Keegan's first season there saw the club go down to tenth place, however, the player himself was named <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or%20%281956%E2%80%932009%29">European Footballer of the Year</a>.
In 1978, <a href="Branko%20Zebec">Branko Zebec</a> was appointed <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">trainer</a> of HSV.

In the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20European%20Cup">1979–80 season</a>, HSV returned to the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> for the first time since <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup">1960–61</a>. As had happened 19 years previously, HSV faced Spanish opposition in the semi-finals. After losing the first leg at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> 2–0, HSV beat <a href="List%20of%20European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20finals">six-time winners</a> <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> 5–1 at the Volksparkstadion to qualify for the final. HSV returned to <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> to play <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in the <a href="1980%20European%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, where they were beaten 1–0. In the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, HSV lost their title by two points, finishing in second place behind champions Bayern Munich.
In December 1980, HSV dismissed Zebec, who had been struggling with a <a href="Alcoholism">drinking problem</a>.

Between 16 January 1982 and 29 January 1983, HSV went undefeated in the Bundesliga. The run stretched across 36 games and remained a <a href="Bundesliga%23Records">Bundesliga record</a> until November 2013, when it was broken by Bayern Munich.
A third Meisterschale followed at the end of the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Bundesliga">1982–83 season</a>, with HSV defending their title against <a href="Nordderby">local rivals</a> <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>.

In December 1983, HSV traveled to <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> where they faced <a href="1983%20Copa%20Libertadores">South American champions</a> <a href="Gr%C3%AAmio%20Foot-Ball%20Porto%20Alegrense">Grêmio</a> in the <a href="1983%20Intercontinental%20Cup">Intercontinental Cup</a>. The Brazilian club took home the trophy, with a 93rd minute winning goal. Back home, they lost the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Bundesliga">league championship</a> to <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> on goal difference.
Both <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Bundesliga">1984–85</a> and <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Bundesliga">1985–86</a> were low seasons for HSV, with the club finishing fifth and seventh respectively. In 1986, midfielder <a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a>, who had played for the club for ten years and scored the winning goal in the <a href="1983%20European%20Cup%20Final">1983 European Cup Final</a>, retired from professional football.
In <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Bundesliga">1986–87</a>, HSV finished second in the Bundesliga and won a fourth <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, beating <a href="Stuttgarter%20Kickers">Stuttgarter Kickers</a> 3–1 in the final at <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a>'s <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a>. After this success, Ernst Happel left the club to return to Austria. He remains HSV's most successful trainer, with two <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">Bundesliga titles</a>, one <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> and one <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Cup</a>.
Modern era.
In the early 1990s, HSV fell in financial trouble. <a href="Thomas%20Doll">Thomas Doll</a> was sold to <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a> for a then record 16 million <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">Deutsche Mark</a>s in June 1991. On the pitch, meanwhile, the team was in decline. After a fifth-place finish in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Bundesliga">1990–91</a>, HSV finished in the bottom half of the Bundesliga in four consecutive seasons.
In October 1995, Felix Magath returned to HSV to become the club's <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">trainer</a>. The following month, Uwe Seeler also returned as the club president. Under the new regime, HSV finished fifth in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, securing <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20UEFA%20Cup">European qualification</a> for the first time in six years. The <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Bundesliga">following season</a>, HSV reached the semi-finals of the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>. In May 1997, however, Magath was fired after a 4–0 defeat to 1. FC Köln, with the team one place above the relegation zone. HSV eventually finished in 13th place under <a href="Hamburger%20SV%20II">reserve team</a> coach <a href="Ralf%20Schehr">Ralf Schehr</a>.
In 1997, HSV appointed <a href="Frank%20Pagelsdorf">Frank Pagelsdorf</a>, who would coach the team for over four years, making him the longest serving trainer since Ernst Happel. A ninth-place finish in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Bundesliga">1997–98</a> was followed by seventh in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Bundesliga">1998–99</a> and third in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Bundesliga">1999–2000</a>, the team's best performance since <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Bundesliga">1986–87</a>.
On 2 September 2000, the new Volksparkstadion was officially opened as <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">the national team</a> played its first <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a> <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Group%209">qualifier</a>, against <a href="Greece%20national%20football%20team">Greece</a>.
In 2000–01, HSV competed in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the first time since <a href="European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20history">the competition's expansion from the old European Cup</a>. Their first match was a 4–4 draw against Juventus, with <a href="Tony%20Yeboah">Tony Yeboah</a> scoring the club's first Champions League goal. HSV failed to qualify for the second round, but managed a 3–1 win over Juventus in the return fixture at the <a href="Stadio%20delle%20Alpi">Stadio delle Alpi</a>.
In July 2003, HSV won its first trophy in 16 years with a 4–2 defeat of Borussia Dortmund in the <a href="2003%20DFB-Ligapokal">DFB-Ligapokal</a> final.
In August 2004, HSV lost in the early rounds of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> by regional league side <a href="SC%20Paderborn%2007">SC Paderborn</a>. <a href="referee%20%28association%20football%29">Referee</a>, <a href="Robert%20Hoyzer">Robert Hoyzer</a>, had accepted money from a Croatian gambling syndicate to <a href="match%20fixing">fix the match</a>, which he did, awarding two penalties to Paderborn and sending off HSV player <a href="%C3%89mile%20Mpenza">Émile Mpenza</a>.
Another third-place finish in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06</a> saw HSV qualify for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> for the second time. They finished bottom of <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage">Group G</a>, with a solitary win against Russian club <a href="PFC%20CSKA%20Moscow">CSKA Moscow</a>. In the league, the team was in 17th place going into the winter break, having won once in the league <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Hamburger%20SV%20season">all season</a>, leading to the dismissal of trainer <a href="Thomas%20Doll">Thomas Doll</a>. Under new coach <a href="Huub%20Stevens">Huub Stevens</a>, HSV advanced further away from the relegation zone and qualified for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> via a seventh-place finish and victory in the <a href="2007%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a>. The following season, Stevens led the team to fourth place in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> before leaving to take over at <a href="List%20of%20Dutch%20football%20champions">Dutch champions</a> <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV Eindhoven</a>. He was replaced by <a href="Martin%20Jol">Martin Jol</a>, who took HSV to the semi-finals of both the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">2008–09 UEFA Cup</a> and the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20DFB-Pokal">2008–09 DFB-Pokal</a>, both of which "die Rothosen" lost to <a href="Nordderby">rivals</a> Werder Bremen. In <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Bundesliga">the league</a>, they did not qualify for the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> on the final day of the season. In the summer of 2009, after only one season, Jol departed to become coach of <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>.
Under new coach <a href="Bruno%20Labbadia">Bruno Labbadia</a>, HSV reached the semi-finals of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> (now renamed the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>) for the second season in a row. However, a defeat in the away leg to <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, days after the firing of Labbadia, denied the club the opportunity to play in the <a href="2010%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">final</a>, which was held at its home stadium.
On 13 October 2011, <a href="Thorsten%20Fink">Thorsten Fink</a> was appointed as coach with the team in the relegation zone after losing six of their opening eight matches. In HSV's first nine games under Fink they were unbeaten, going into the winter break in 13th place. The team finished the season the season the season the season <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Bundesliga">the season</a> in 15hth position, avoiding by five points what would have been its first relegation. In <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13</a>, HSV recorded a seventh-place finish. During <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Hamburger%20SV%20season">the season</a>, however, the team equaled the club's record Bundesliga defeat, losing 9–2 at the <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz Arena</a> to Bayern Munich.
Fink was replaced on 25 September 2013 by <a href="Bert%20van%20Marwijk">Bert van Marwijk</a>, who in the same season was replaced by <a href="Mirko%20Slomka">Mirko Slomka</a> on 17 February 2014. Under Slomka, the club narrowly avoided its first relegation from the Bundesliga in May 2014, by defeating <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">Greuther Fürth</a> on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a> in a play-off.
Hamburg once again changed managers due to a poor start of the season, firing <a href="Mirko%20Slomka">Slomka</a> in 2014. His successor <a href="Josef%20Zinnbauer">Josef Zinnbauer</a> held the job until March of said year and was replaced by interim coach <a href="Peter%20Kn%C3%A4bel">Peter Knäbel</a>, who was eventually replaced by returning Bruno Labbadia, who saved the club at the end of the season in the relegation play-off for the second year running against <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a>. Labbadia achieved only two points in the first ten games of the 2016–17 season, and was replaced by <a href="Markus%20Gisdol">Markus Gisdol</a>, reached 20 points in 9 games from the 19th match day to the 28th match day. On the last match day, Hamburg avoided the relegation play-offs and stayed in the Bundesliga.
Relegation and missed promotions.
In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Bundesliga">2017–18 Bundesliga</a>, after a 3–1 defeat in the first round of <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> against the third-division team <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a>, HSV had two wins against <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a> and <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>. However, eight games followed without a win. At the end of the first half of the season, HSV was in second last place in the table. After two defeats in the first two games of the second half, coach <a href="Markus%20Gisdol">Markus Gisdol</a> was dismissed. HSV hired <a href="Bernd%20Hollerbach">Bernd Hollerbach</a>, a former player of the club, as a new coach. After seven games without a win and a 6–0 defeat against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, he was also dismissed in 2018. A few days before the game against Bayern, the club announced the dismissal of CEO <a href="Heribert%20Bruchhagen">Heribert Bruchhagen</a>. Frank Wettstein, CFO of the club, was appointed as the new CEO. On the day of his appointment, he dismissed the sports director <a href="Jens%20Todt">Jens Todt</a>. The club hired former successful HSV player <a href="Thomas%20von%20Heesen">Thomas von Heesen</a> as a sports consultant until the end of season. For the last eight games in the 2017–18 Bundesliga, the club promoted the coach of Hamburger SV II, Christian Titz. In the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a> (fourth league), his team were the top of the table. With four wins and an offensively minded style of play, the coach convinced the club and received a two-year contract.
After the low season in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Hamburger%20SV%20season">2017–18</a> Bundesliga under three different coaches, a final day win over <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a> was not enough to escape relegation after <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">Wolfsburg</a> won against <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">Köln</a> 4–1. They were relegated to the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%202.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> for the first time in the Bundesliga's 55-year history, causing riots by Hamburg supporters.
After the relegation <a href="Christian%20Titz">Christian Titz</a> was sacked in October 2018, and replaced by <a href="Hannes%20Wolf%20%28football%20manager%29">Hannes Wolf</a>. Hamburg did not gain promotion back to the Bundesliga, and failed to reach the playoffs, with a one-point difference between them and <a href="Union%20Berlin">Union Berlin</a>. The team reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20DFB-Pokal">2018–19 DFB-Pokal</a>, before being defeated by <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a> 1–3 at home.
For the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%202.%20Bundesliga">2019–20 2. Bundesliga</a>, their second year in the 2. Bundesliga, Wolf was laid-off and was replaced by <a href="Dieter%20Hecking">Dieter Hecking</a>. They did not get a return to the Bundesliga by one-point, and they were eliminated in the second round of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20DFB%20Pokal">2019–20 DFB Pokal</a> by <a href="Vfb%20Stuttgart">Vfb Stuttgart</a> 1–2 in extra time.
By again missing promotion, Hecking's contract was not extended. For the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%202.%20Bundesliga">2020–21 season</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Thioune">Daniel Thioune</a> was brought in as the new head coach from league rivals <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a>. The season began with a 1–4 first-round knockout loss in the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> to <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> club <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden">Dynamo Dresden</a>. Despite this loss, HSV then started the season and won the first 5 games. After a subsequent winless streak of 5 games, 3 of which were lost in a row, the team stabilised again from matchday 11 and went undefeated until the winter break. HSV ended the season as first in the league table. From matchday 20 and onwards, HSV were again winless for 5 games. After 2 wins, another winless series of 5 games followed from matchday 27 and onwards, during which, the club drawed against <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a> 3–3. The club also lost to relegation candidates <a href="SV%20Sandhausen">SV Sandhausen</a>. Due to this development, Thioune was released at the beginning of May 2021, and replaced by the head of academy <a href="Horst%20Hrubesch">Horst Hrubesch</a> for the final three games of the season. At that point, HSV were in third place with 52 points, five points from a spot guaranteeing direct promotion.
In the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%202.%20Bundesliga">2021–22 season</a>, HSV reached promotion to reach the promotion playoff spot, finishing third on goal difference over <a href="Darmstadt%2098">Darmstadt 98</a>. Once again, however, the season ended with HSV losing the Bundesliga's 16th place side <a href="Hertha%20Berlin">Hertha Berlin</a> 1–2 in the playoff, losing to a 0–2 home defeat, despite winning the first leg in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>.
In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%202.%20Bundesliga">2022–23 season</a>, their fifth season in the 2. Bundesliga, the club had the highest spectator average of any second-division club in Europe. During that season, Hamburger SV were in the top three places since matchday 6, and finished the year 2022 in second place. On the last matchday, HSV played an away match against <a href="SV%20Sandhausen">SV Sandhausen</a>, where they won 1–0, and as <a href="SSV%20Jahn%20Regensburg">SSV Jahn Regensburg</a> were leading 2–1 against second-place <a href="1.%20FC%20Heidenheim">1. FC Heidenheim</a>, HSV were about to be promoted to Bundesliga. However during eleven minutes of stoppage time, Heidenheim scored two goals to finish top; hence, Hamburger SV had to play the promotion/relegation play-offs against VfB Stuttgart. They lost both legs, missing promotion to the top division for the fifth year in a row.
Stadium.
Hamburger SV plays its home games in the <a href="Volksparkstadion">Volksparkstadion</a>, which was previously known as the Imtech Arena between 2010 and 2015. Built on the site of the original Volksparkstadion, opened in 1953, the current stadium was opened in 2000, and has a capacity of 57,000 – approximately 47,000 seats with another 10,000 spectators standing. The first Volksparkstadion had been a venue for the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 World Cup</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201988">UEFA Euro 1988</a>. The Volksparkstadion is a <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> category one stadium, which certifies it to host <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> finals. The stadium was the site of four group matches and a quarter-final of the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a>, hosted by Germany, and was known as "FIFA World Cup Stadium Hamburg" during the event. It was also the venue for the <a href="2010%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">2010 UEFA Europa League Final</a>.
HSV fans can be buried at a dedicated graveyard near the home stadium, covered in turf from the original Hamburg pitch.
Rivals and affinities.
HSV contests the <a href="Nordderby">Nordderby</a> with fellow <a href="Northern%20Germany">Northern Germany</a> side <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>. In Spring 2009, HSV faced Werder four times in only three weeks, and Werder defeated HSV in the UEFA-Cup semi-final, as well as in the DFB-Pokal semi-final.
Furthermore, HSV shares a cross-town rivalry with <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a>. When, after seven years in different leagues, the game where HSV played against <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a>, there were already disputes between both fan groups several weeks before the game. It started when about 100 HSV fans interrupted a St. Pauli concert because it took place on the "HSV-side" of the <a href="Reeperbahn">Reeperbahn</a>. In a league game, the HSV fans showed a banner in the stadium with the inscription "Stellt euch endlich unsrer Gier – 100 Ihr : 100 Wir" ("Finally satisfy our lust – 100 of you vs. 100 of us"). After fans of <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a> attacked HSV fans working on a choreography for the game and destroyed parts of it, some HSV fans threatened them by hanging figures in the colours of the rival at several bridges throughout the city. In addition, one day later there was a march of about 80 HSV-Ultras across the <a href="Reeperbahn">Reeperbahn</a>, where insulting chants against St. Pauli were screamed. In the hours leading up to first <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> Hamburg Derby on 10 March 2019 at the <a href="Millerntor-Stadion">Millerntor-Stadion</a>, the supporters groups of both teams were escorted by the Hamburg police to avoid conflict. They won with a 4–0 win over <a href="FC%20St.%20Pauli">FC St. Pauli</a> at the <a href="Millerntor-Stadion">Millerntor-Stadion</a>, the first time HSV had won at the stadium in the <a href="St.%20Pauli">St. Pauli</a> quarter since 1962. In response to <a href="Benedikt%20Pliquett">Benedikt Pliquett</a>'s celebratory kick of HSV's corner flag at the <a href="Volksparkstadion">Volksparkstadion</a> in 2011, <a href="Tom%20Mickel">Tom Mickel</a> mimicked Pliquett with a "Kung-Fu Kick" of his own, according to <a href="Hamburger%20Morgenpost">MOPO</a>.
HSV have an affinity with <a href="Scottish%20Football%20League">Scottish</a> club <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>. HSV fans unfurl their club logo at Rangers's away European matches. The link between Rangers and Hamburg dates back to 1977, when the Hamburg Rangers Supporters' Club was set up by HSV fans who had visited Rangers matches before and were thrilled by the atmosphere at Ibrox. The links were further strengthened when Rangers signed <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Albertz">Jörg Albertz</a> from Hamburg. In the derby against St. Pauli in the season 2018–19 about 200–300 fans of the Scottish club traveled to Hamburg to support HSV. The friendship between <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> and Hamburg's rivals FC St. Nevertheless, the HSV fans sent a provocation towards Celtic, when they played in the <a href="Europa%20League">Europa League</a> in 2009. They showed a <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a>, bearing the words "No Surrender", as a big choreography in the stadium.
HSV have a friendship bond with <a href="Hannover%2096">Hannover 96</a> due to both being known by the abbreviation "HSV". Their meetings involve the visitors' club song being played, and fans chanting "HSV" from each end of the stadium.
Furthermore, Hamburger SV has a friendship bond with <a href="Arminia%20Bielefeld">Arminia Bielefeld</a> – both teams share the same colours, resulting in the popular fan chant "Schwarz, weiß, blau – Arminia und der HSV" ("Black, white, blue – Arminia and the HSV"). Especially in the 1990s, multiple players transferred between the two clubs.
As Hannover and Bielefeld fans have affinities as well, all three clubs are sometimes called the "Nordallianz" ("Northern Alliance") despite the fact that the city of Bielefeld is not technically located in Northern Germany.
In addition, some fan groups maintain good contacts with the fourth division team <a href="VfB%20L%C3%BCbeck">VfB Lübeck</a>, whose fans also have an aversion to St. Pauli and Holstein Kiel. In 2013, HSV helped the club, which was threatened by insolvency, with a free friendly match, in which the team competed with several national players to attract as many spectators as possible and left the entire earnings for <a href="VfB%20L%C3%BCbeck">VfB Lübeck</a>.
Fans.
The band <a href="Abschlach%21">Abschlach!</a> has written the HSV anthem Mein Hamburg lieb ich sehr. The band always plays this song before HSV games.
HSV has more than 700 officially registered fan clubs in Germany and abroad. These include "Rautengeil Fallingbostel", "Hermanns Treue Riege", "Totale Offensive e. V." and the "Wilhelmsburg Boys". HSV ultra groups are or were "Poptown" and "Chosen Few". The "Rothosen" supporters' association founded in April 1972 is the oldest HSV fan club. It still has around 40 members. The business fan club of Hamburger SV was registered by HSV as an official fan club in 2006. This fan club was founded by entrepreneurs and combines sporting interests with business interests. Since the 2006–07 season, the Hamburger Sport-Verein has had a fan club for gay and bisexual fans called "BLUE PRIDE", which merged into the "Volksparkjunxx" in January 2012. The members of fan club "Die Löwen" are aggressive. The group was associated with <a href="skinheads">skinheads</a> and <a href="Far-right%20politics">right-wing radicalism</a> in the 1980s. The <a href="Werder%20Bremen">Bremen</a> fan Adrian Maleika was murdered by members of the group on 16 October 1982.
As a reaction to the murder of Maleika, the HSV fan project was founded, which still exists today and is financially supported by the German Football League and the Hamburg Authority for Labour, Social Affairs, Family and Integration. The fan project makes travel offers for away games and supports the Supporters Club with its offers. Numerous events take place in the fan house, also with the support of HSV itself.
The Supporters Club, founded in 1993, has (as of 1 June 2019) been joined by 66,489 fans, who have thus also become members of HSV. The 36 founding members include the former board member responsible for membership matters, Oliver Scheel, the former supervisory board members Henning Trolsen and Christian Reichert, and the current director of the HSV Museum, Dirk Mansen.
As a reaction to the spin-off, fans founded the "<a href="HFC%20Falke">HFC Falke</a>" – based on the model of FC United of Manchester – which started playing in the 2015–16 season, and as of 2024, are playing in the Hamburg district league north.
Club kit and colours.
The club colours are officially blue, white and black, according to its statute, but its fans use the combination "schwarz-weiss-blau" (black-white-blue) in their songs and chants; they also chant "HSV" . The club crest is a black and white diamond on a blue background. These were the colours of SC Germania. The use of the blue background is a link with Hamburg's maritime tradition as the "<a href="International%20maritime%20signal%20flags">Blue Peter flag</a>" signal (meaning "All Aboard" or "Outward Bound") is a white rectangle on a similar blue background.
In contrast, the team's home kit is white jerseys and red shorts, which are the colours of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. As a result, the team's most common nickname is "die Rothosen" ("the Red Shorts"). HSV was previously also known as "der Dinosaurier" ("the Dinosaur"), and used a dinosaur mascot called "Hermann" (named after long-time club physiotherapist Hermann Rieger) for marketing purposes.
HSV's kit was made by <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> from 1978 to 1995 and the club re-engaged Adidas in 2007, having worked with a number of its competitors in the meantime. The first shirt sponsorship was introduced in 1974. The following is a list of shirt sponsors by date:

HSV's first participation in European competition came after they won the German championship in 1960 and were invited to take part in the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup">1960–61 European Cup</a>. They had a match in the preliminary round, and their first round opponents were <a href="BSC%20Young%20Boys">Young Boys</a>. HSV won the two-legged tie 8–3 on aggregate, beating the Swiss side 0–5 in the away leg on 2 November 1960, and then drawing 3–3 at home on 27 November.
HSV reached the semi-final of the European Cup in 1961. Subsequently, they have twice played in the final, losing 1–0 to <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in 1980 and defeating <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> 1–0 in 1983. With <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, HSV is one of three German teams who have won the European Cup. HSV won the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> in 1976–77, and have been runners-up in both that competition and the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>. Their most recent European campaign was the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2009–10 UEFA Europa League</a>, in which they reached the semi-final.
Hamburg became, in 1982, the first club in European football to have been runner-up in all three major UEFA club competitions, having lost the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1967–68 European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20European%20Cup">1979–80 European Cup</a> and the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20UEFA%20Cup">1981–82 UEFA Cup</a> finals. Additionally, having lost the <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">European Super Cup</a> for the first time in the <a href="1977%20European%20Super%20Cup">1977 edition</a>, the <a href="1983%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1983 Intercontinental Cup</a> and in the <a href="1999%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup</a>, they became the first and only club in Europe to have obtained the silver medal in all six confederation competitions.
HSV's biggest win in a European match occurred on 23 October 1974 when they defeated Romanian team <a href="FC%20Bra%C8%99ov%20%281936%29">Brașov</a> 8–0 in a UEFA Cup second round tie. Their biggest defeat was in the second leg of the 1977 Super Cup when they lost 6–0 to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> on 6 December. <a href="Manfred%20Kaltz">Manfred Kaltz</a> with 81 has made the most appearances for HSV in Europe and <a href="Horst%20Hrubesch">Horst Hrubesch</a> with 20 is their leading goalscorer.
Based on data published by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>, a summary of HSV's European record to the end of the 2021–22 season is as follows:
According to UEFA, HSV is currently unranked among European clubs. The last year that the club had a coefficient was in 2014 when it ranked 64th (34.328).
Honours.
HSV have the record in German football of having won the most regional titles, having won 31 regional titles. However, the regional titles do not count as a trophy or even as a title itself. Winning a regional title only guaranteed a club to battle, with other regional winning clubs, for the German Championship.
Hamburg's three Bundesliga championships entitle the club to display one <a href="Star%20%28football%20badge%29">gold star</a> of the "Verdiente Meistervereine". Under the current award system, their pre-Bundesliga championships are not recognized, and so they are not entitled to the second star of a five-time champion.
After the replay of the championship final in 1922 had to be abandoned due to the opponents no longer having enough players on the ground, the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB) requested HSV to renounce the title, which the club did.
During his first season with Hamburger SV (2000–01), <a href="Sergej%20Barbarez">Sergej Barbarez</a> became the top scorer for his club with 22 goals and joint top scorer of the Bundesliga with <a href="Ebbe%20Sand">Ebbe Sand</a>.
Until the 2017–18 season, HSV took pride in its status as the only club to have played continuously in the Bundesliga since its foundation. A large clock in the northwest corner of the Volksparkstadion marked the time, down to the second, since the league was founded on 24 August 1963.

FC Hansa Rostock

FC Hansa Rostock () is a <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German association football club</a> based in the city of <a href="Rostock">Rostock</a>, <a href="Mecklenburg-Vorpommern">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern</a>. The club is also called as "the <a href="Cog%20%28ship%29">cog</a>" because of its club crest. They have emerged as one of the most successful clubs from the former <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> after <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a> and have made several appearances in the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">top-flight</a> <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. With 21,416 club members, the club is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany.
After being in the Bundesliga for ten years, from 1995 to 2005, Rostock went into a steady decline. In 2012, the club was relegated to the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> for the second time, regaining its place in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%203.%20Liga">2021</a>.
History.
The club was originally founded on 1 November 1954 as the multi-sport <a href="Sports%20club%20%28East%20Germany%29">sports club</a> SC Empor Rostock. The football squad, however, could not be recruited from local enterprise sports communities (, BSG) like the squad of the handball section, so a transfer of BSG Empor Lauter's squad from <a href="Lauter%2C%20Saxony">Lauter</a> to Rostock was considered. The area around Lauter, near the <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czech</a> border, was well represented in <a href="East%20German">East German</a> football by competitive sides, including <a href="Wismut%20Aue">Wismut Aue</a>, <a href="Meeraner%20SV">Fortschritt Meerane</a> and <a href="FSV%20Zwickau">Motor Zwickau</a>, so the footballers of "BSG Empor Lauter" were delegated to Rostock, over the futile protests of the team's local supporters. Then <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a> First Secretary in <a href="Bezirk%20Rostock">Bezirk Rostock</a> Karl Mewis and SED functionary <a href="Harry%20Tisch">Harry Tisch</a> were instrumental in the relocation of BSG Empor Lauter to Rostock. Karl Lewis was allegedly the initiator of the relocation. This was not an uncommon occurrence in the 1950s of East German football, where clubs were regularly renamed, re-structured, dismantled or shuffled from city to city at the direction of well-placed communist officials. The new club would be sponsored by the fishing <a href="Combine%20%28enterprise%29">combine</a> VEB Fischkombinat Rostock. 
The wholesale transfer of the "Lauterers" to Rostock part way through the 1954–55 season led to the disappearance of that association from play. A new club was formed in 1956 as BSG Motor Lauter and on 1 August 1990, it took up the tradition of the original side to play as Lauterer Sportverein Viktoria 1913.
Play in Rostock.
Newly formed SC Empor Rostock took the place of the former Lauter-based club in first division play in November 1954. They finished second the next season, but in 1956 plunged to 14th place and were relegated. They quickly bounced back, rejoining the DDR-Oberliga in 1958, before going on to become a very competitive side with a series of three vice-championships to their credit from 1962 to 1964, as well as several appearances in the final of the <a href="FDGB%20Pokal">FDGB Pokal</a>. The re-organization of East German sports in 1965 led to the association's football department becoming independent as Fußball Club Hansa Rostock, which was designated as one of the country's 10 dedicated <a href="Football%20club%20%28East%20Germany%29">football club</a> intended to groom talent for the development of a strong <a href="East%20Germany%20national%20football%20team">East Germany national team</a>. The new club's name acknowledged Rostock's history as one of the major trading centres of northern Europe's <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic League</a>. FC Hansa Rostock would be sponsored by the maritime combine VEB Kombinat Seeverkehr und Hafenwirtschaft. And the club would be <a href="patronage">patronage</a>d by the SED First Secretary of Bezirk Rostock, as well as future <a href="Free%20German%20Trade%20Union%20Federation">Free German Trade Union Federation</a> chairman and <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a> member Harry Tisch. 
By the 1970s, the club was consistently finishing in the lower half of the league table and was relegated to the second division <a href="DDR-Liga">DDR-Liga</a> for a single season on three occasions late in the decade. They returned to form in the 1980s, and, as the football leagues of West Germany and East Germany were merged in 1990 after the <a href="German%20re-unification">re-unification</a> of the country, Rostock won its first national championship in the final season of East German football, played out in the transitional <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NOFV-Oberliga">NOFV-Oberliga</a>. This is their only top flight title to date in play in East Germany or the unified Germany.
They also captured the last East German Cup with a 1–0 win over "<a href="Eisenh%C3%BCttenst%C3%A4dter%20FC%20Stahl">FC Stahl Eisenhüttenstadt</a>".
United Germany and the Bundesliga.
The club's timely success earned them a place in the Bundesliga alongside <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden">Dynamo Dresden</a> when the top-flight Bundesliga was briefly expanded from 18 to 20 teams for the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Bundesliga">1991–92 season</a> to accommodate two former East German teams. Hansa, however, was unable to stay up and was relegated after falling just a single point shy of <a href="SG%20Wattenscheid%2009">SG Wattenscheid 09</a>. Three seasons of tempering in the 2. Bundesliga would return the club to the top flight for the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Bundesliga">1995–96 season</a>. In ten years spent in the Bundesliga, the team's best results were a pair of sixth-place finishes. In spite of frequent placings in the bottom-half of the league table, they would persist as the only former East German side able to consistently challenge the well-heeled clubs of the west. On 1 December 2002, Rostock became the first club to field six foreigners from the same country in a Bundesliga match (<a href="Rade%20Prica">Rade Prica</a>, <a href="Marcus%20Lantz">Marcus Lantz</a>, <a href="Peter%20Wibr%C3%A5n">Peter Wibrån</a>, <a href="Andreas%20Jakobsson">Andreas Jakobsson</a>, <a href="Magnus%20Arvidsson%20%28footballer%29">Magnus Arvidsson</a> and <a href="Joakim%20Persson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201975%29">Joakim Persson</a> – all <a href="Swedes">Swedes</a>).
Hansa had a very poor first half in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Bundesliga">2004–05 season</a>, earning only 1 win and 5 draws in 17 matches. They were unable to recover despite the late arrival of Finnish striker <a href="Jari%20Litmanen">Jari Litmanen</a> and at season's end were relegated, leaving the former GDR without a club in the top flight for the first time since re-unification. Like other East German teams, they were the victims of a harsh economic reality as the wealthier, well-established western sides bought up the most talented eastern footballers as their clubs struggled to survive financially: Rostock's <a href="Stefan%20Beinlich">Stefan Beinlich</a>, <a href="Oliver%20Neuville">Oliver Neuville</a> and <a href="Victor%20Agali">Victor Agali</a> were just three players sent west in exchange for cash. After two years in the 2. Bundesliga, the club returned to the top-flight for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a>, but was again relegated.
The club's poor form continued in 2009–10 and they finished third-last. With this season, a new promotion/relegation format accompanied the introduction of the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> and Rostock faced a playoff versus the third place third division club <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">FC Ingolstadt</a>. Hansa lost both legs of the contest and was sent down to the 3. Liga, while Ingolstadt won promotion to the 2. Bundesliga alongside the top two third tier teams which advanced automatically by virtue of their finishes. Their stay was a short one as they were sent back down after finishing bottom table in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%202.%20Bundesliga">2011–12</a>.
Hansa Rostock drew an average home attendance of 11,433 in the 2016–17 3. Liga, the third-highest in the league.
Honours.
After <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, the last regular <a href="DDR-Oberliga">DDR-Oberliga</a> season was played in <a href="NOFV-Oberliga">NOFV-Oberliga</a>. During <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NOFV-Oberliga">1990–91 NOFV-Oberliga</a> season, Hansa Rostock became the last <a href="List%20of%20East%20German%20football%20champions">East Germany</a> champion.
Double.

Fans.
A study published in 2007 by <a href="Sportfive">Sportfive</a> reported Hansa's fanbase to be the seventh largest in Germany, involving up to two million supporters. According to another study published in 2008 by <a href="Allensbach%20Institute">Allensbach Institute</a>, Hansa is the most popular German football club in the <a href="New%20L%C3%A4nder">New Länder</a> and the most popular club of the former GDR in reunited Germany. Hansa Rostock's official <a href="anthem">anthem</a> is "FC Hansa, wir lieben Dich total" ("Hansa FC, We Totally Love You"), recorded in 1995 by East German band <a href="Puhdys">Puhdys</a>.
Hansa struggles with <a href="hooliganism">hooliganism</a>, estimating up to 500 supporters to be leaning towards violence. The club itself, as well as some fans' associations, are anxious to curtail these in several ways. In 2005, the club successfully sued three <a href="streaking">streakers</a> who disrupted their 2003 match against <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> to recoup the <a href="Euro">€</a>20,000 they were fined by the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB) for failing to maintain adequate security at their ground.
Stadium.
The original Ostseestadion was built in 1954, with the participation of several hundred citizens of Rostock who helped for free. The first international match in the Ostseestadion of East Germany was on 26 September 1956. In 2001, the stadium was refurbished and modified to accommodate 30,000 spectators.
Reserve team.
The <a href="German%20reserve%20football%20teams">club's reserve team</a>, FC Hansa Rostock II, has played as high as <a href="Regionalliga">Regionalliga</a> level, last playing in the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a> in 2009–10. The team currently plays in the tier five <a href="NOFV-Oberliga%20Nord">NOFV-Oberliga Nord</a>. It first reached Oberliga level in 1992 and has won three league championships at this level, in 2000, 2005 and 2012.
In 1998, 2005 and 2006, it also won the <a href="Mecklenburg-Vorpommern%20Cup">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Cup</a>, the local cup competition in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal through this, but never advanced past its first round.

History.
Foundation to WWII.
"Verein für Bewegungsspiele Stuttgart" was formed through a 2 April 1912 merger of predecessor sides "Stuttgarter FV" and "FC Krone Cannstatt" following a meeting in the Concordia hotel in <a href="Cannstatt">Cannstatt</a>. Each of these clubs was made up of school pupils with middle-class roots who learned new sports such as <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> and football from English expatriates such as <a href="William%20Cail">William Cail</a> who introduced rugby in 1865.
FV Stuttgart.
"Stuttgarter Fußballverein" was founded at the Zum Becher hotel in Stuttgart on 9 September 1893. "FV" were initially a rugby club, playing games at Stöckach-Eisbahn before moving to Cannstatter Wasen in 1894. The rugby club established a football section in 1908. The team drew players primarily from local schools, under the direction of teacher Carl Kaufmann, and quickly achieved its first success; in 1909, they were runners-up to "FSV 1897 Hannover" in the national rugby final, losing 6–3. Rugby was soon replaced by association football within the club, as spectators found the game too complicated to follow.
In 1909, "FV" joined the Süddeutschen Fußballverband (South German Football Association), playing in the second tier B-Klasse. In their second season "FV" won a district final against future merger partner "Kronen-Klub Cannstatt" before being defeated by "FV Zuffenhausen" in the county championship that would have seen the side promoted. They eventually advanced to the senior <a href="S%C3%BCdkreis-Liga">Südkreis-Liga</a> in 1912.
Kronenclub Cannstatt.
"Cannstatter Fußballklub" was formed as a rugby club in 1890 and also quickly established a football team. This club was dissolved after just a few years of play and the former membership re-organized themselves as "FC Krone Cannstatt" in 1897 to compete as a football-only side. The new team joined the Süddeutschen Fußballverband (SFV) as a second division club and won promotion in 1904. "Krone" possessed their own ground, which still exists today as the home of TSV Münster.
Following the 1912 merger of these two clubs, the combined side played at first in the <a href="Kreisliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kreisliga Württemberg</a> and then in the <a href="Bezirksliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg-Baden">Bezirksliga Württemberg-Baden</a>, earning a number of top three finishes and claiming a title there in 1927. The club also made several appearances in the final rounds of the SFV in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
1930s and 1940s.
In 1933, VfB moved to <a href="MHPArena">Neckar Stadium</a>, the site of its current ground. German football was re-organized that same year under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> into sixteen top-flight divisions called <a href="Gauliga">Gauligen</a>. Stuttgart played in the <a href="Gauliga%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Gauliga Württemberg</a> and enjoyed considerable success there, winning division titles in 1935, 1937, 1938, 1940, and 1943 before the Gauliga system collapsed part way through the 1944–45 season due to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The club had an intense rivalry with <a href="Stuttgarter%20Kickers">Stuttgarter Kickers</a> throughout this period.
VfB's Gauliga titles earned the team entry to the national playoff rounds, with their best result coming in 1935 when they advanced to the final where they lost 4–6 to defending champions <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, the dominant side of the era. After a third-place result at the national level in 1937, Stuttgart was not able to advance out of the preliminary rounds in subsequent appearances.
Successes through the 1950s.
VfB continued to play first division football in the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Süd</a>, capturing titles in 1946, 1952, and 1954. They made regular appearances in the German championship rounds, emerging as <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">national champions</a> in 1950 and 1952, finishing as runner-up in 1953, and winning two <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> titles in <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20DFB-Pokal">1954</a> and <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20DFB-Pokal">1958</a>. The team which won four titles in eight years was led by <a href="Robert%20Schlienz">Robert Schlienz</a> who had lost his left arm in a car crash. Despite these successes, no player from the Stuttgart squad had a place in the team that won the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954 FIFA World Cup</a>.
Original Bundesligist.
Due to disappointing results in international competition including the <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958</a> and <a href="1962%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1962 FIFA World Cup</a>, and in response to the growth of professionalism in the sport, the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (Deutscher Fußball Bund, or DFB) replaced the regional top flight competitions with a single nationwide professional league in 1963. Stuttgart's consistently solid play through the 1950s earned them a place among the 16 clubs that would make up the original <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>. As an amateur organisation, and due to proverbial <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>n austerity, the club hesitated to spend money, and some players continued to work in an everyday job. Throughout the balance of the decade and until the mid-1970s, the club would generally earn mid-table results. One of the few stars of the time was <a href="Gilbert%20Gress">Gilbert Gress</a> from <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>.
In <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Bundesliga">1973</a>, the team qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> for the first time and advanced to the semi-finals of the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20UEFA%20Cup">1974</a> tournament where they were eliminated by eventual winners <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> (1–2, 2–2).
1975–2000: Era of president MV.
VfB Stuttgart was in crisis in the mid-1970s, having missed new trends in football such as club sponsorship. Attempts to catch up with new levels of professionalism by spending money failed. Towards the end of the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Bundesliga">1974–75 season</a>, with the team in imminent danger of being relegated to <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">Second Bundesliga</a>, local politician <a href="Gerhard%20Mayer-Vorfelder">Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder</a> was elected as new president. However, a draw in the final game of the season meant that VfB would be ranked 16th and lose its Bundesliga status. The first season in the second league, considered the worst in its history, ended with VfB being ranked 11th, having even lost a home game against local rival <a href="SSV%20Reutlingen">SSV Reutlingen</a> in front of just 1,200 spectators.
With new coach <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Sundermann">Jürgen Sundermann</a> and new talents like <a href="Karlheinz%20F%C3%B6rster">Karlheinz Förster</a> and <a href="Hansi%20M%C3%BCller">Hansi Müller</a> (1975/76-1981/82), the team built around <a href="Ottmar%20Hitzfeld">Ottmar Hitzfeld</a> scored one hundred goals in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%202.%20Bundesliga">1976–77</a> and thus returned to the top-flight after just two seasons.
The young team was popular for offensive and high-scoring play, but suffered from lack of experience. At the end of <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Bundesliga">1977–78</a>, VfB was ranked fourth, but the average attendance of over 53,000 set the league record until the 1990s. In 1978/79 they finished second in the Bundesliga. They made another UEFA Cup semi-final appearance in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20UEFA%20Cup">1980</a> and delivered a number of top four finishes on their way to their first Bundesliga title – the club's third national title – in the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Bundesliga">1983/84</a> season, now under coach <a href="Helmut%20Benthaus">Helmut Benthaus</a>.
In 1986, VfB lost the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal final</a> 2–5 to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. In the <a href="1989%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">1989 UEFA Cup Final</a>, with <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann">Jürgen Klinsmann</a> in their ranks, they lost out to <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a> (1–2, 3–3), where <a href="Diego%20Maradona">Diego Maradona</a> was playing at the time.
In <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Bundesliga">1991–92</a>, Stuttgart clinched its fourth title, in one of the closest races in Bundesliga history, finishing ahead of <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> on goal difference. Internationally, they had been eliminated from UEFA Cup play that season (<a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20UEFA%20Cup">1991–92</a>) after losing their second round match to Spanish side <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a> (2–3). As national champions, the club qualified to play in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1992–93</a>, but were eliminated in the first round by <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> after a tie-breaking third match in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> which was required due to coach <a href="Christoph%20Daum">Christoph Daum</a> having substituted a fourth non-German player in the tie's second leg.
VfB did not qualify for any European competition again until 1997, by way of their third German Cup win, with coach <a href="Joachim%20L%C3%B6w">Joachim Löw</a>. They enjoyed a measure of success on their return, advancing to the <a href="1998%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1998 European Cup Winners' Cup final</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, where they lost to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in what was the penultimate year of the competition. Only one player of the "magic triangle", captain <a href="Krassimir%20Balakov">Krassimir Balakov</a>, remained after <a href="Giovane%20%C3%89lber">Giovane Élber</a> and <a href="Fredi%20Bobic">Fredi Bobic</a> left. Löw's contract was not renewed, and he was replaced by <a href="Winfried%20Sch%C3%A4fer">Winfried Schäfer</a>, who in turn was sacked after one season.
Stuttgart's performance, however, fell off after this as the club earned just mid-table results over the next two seasons despite spending money on the transfer market and having veterans like Balakov.
2000–2007: The post-MV-era return to success.
Due to high debts and the lack of results, Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder finally resigned from VfB in 2000 to take over offices at the DFB, <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>, and <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>. New president Manfred Haas had to renegotiate expensive contracts with players who seldom appeared on the field anyway. As in 1976, when Mayer-Vorfelder had taken over, the team had to be rebuilt by relying on talents from the youth teams. The VfB has Germany's most successful program in the German youth Championship.
Coach <a href="Ralf%20Rangnick">Ralf Rangnick</a> had started a restructuring of the team that won the Intertoto Cup, but the resulting extra strain of the UEFA Cup participation ended in narrowly escaping from relegation in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Bundesliga">2001</a> by clinching the 15th spot in the league table. Rangnick was replaced by <a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a>.
With players like <a href="Andreas%20Hinkel">Andreas Hinkel</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Kur%C3%A1nyi">Kevin Kurányi</a>, <a href="Timo%20Hildebrand">Timo Hildebrand</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Hleb">Alexander Hleb</a> earning themselves the nickname "the young and wild" , the club soon re-bounded and finished as Bundesliga runners-up in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Bundesliga">2002–03 season</a>. In July 2003, <a href="Erwin%20Staudt">Erwin Staudt</a> became the new president of the club.
2003–04 Champions League.
VfB qualified for their second Champions League appearance for <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2003–04</a>, beating <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> once and <a href="Panathinaikos%20F.C.">Panathinaikos</a> twice to advance from the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage">group stage</a> as runners-up to Manchester United. They were then matched against Chelsea in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20stage">round of 16</a>, falling 0–1 and 0–0 over two legs.
Stuttgart continued to play as one of the top teams in the country, earning fourth and fifth place Bundesliga finishes in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Bundesliga">2003–04</a> and <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Bundesliga">2004–05</a> respectively, and again taking part in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, but without great success. In addition, coach Magath and several players left for another clubs: Kevin Kurányi for Schalke 04, <a href="Philipp%20Lahm">Philipp Lahm</a> for Bayern Munich and Alexander Hleb for <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>.
Halfway through the disappointing <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06 season</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Trapattoni">Giovanni Trapattoni</a> was sacked and replaced by <a href="Armin%20Veh">Armin Veh</a>. The new coach was designated as a stop-gap due to having resigned from <a href="F.C.%20Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a> in 2003 to focus on his family and having no football job since 2004, save for coaching his home team <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a> for one season. Supported by new manager <a href="Horst%20Heldt">Horst Heldt</a>, Veh could establish himself and his concept of focusing on promising inexpensive players rather than established stars. Team captain, <a href="Zvonimir%20Soldo">Zvonimir Soldo</a>, retired, and other veterans left the team that slipped to ninth place and did not qualify for European competition for the first time in four years.
Bundesliga champions 2006–07.
Despite early-season losses and ensuing criticism in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">2006–07</a>, including a 3–0 loss at home to <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>, Veh managed to turn the collection of new players like Mexicans <a href="P%C3%A1vel%20Pardo">Pável Pardo</a>, and <a href="Ricardo%20Osorio">Ricardo Osorio</a>, Brazilian <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20da%20Silva%20%28footballer%29">Antônio da Silva</a> and fresh local talents, including <a href="Mario%20G%C3%B3mez">Mario Gómez</a>, <a href="Serdar%20Tasci">Serdar Tasci</a>, and <a href="Sami%20Khedira">Sami Khedira</a>, into a strong contender that led the league on 12 November 2006 for the first time in two years. Stuttgart established themselves among the top five and delivered a strong challenge for the Bundesliga title by winning their final eight games. In the penultimate week on 12 May 2007, Stuttgart beat <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a> 3–2 away from home, taking the Bundesliga lead from Schalke 04 and at minimum securing a spot in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2007–08 Champions League</a>. After trailing 0–1 in the final match of the season against <a href="FC%20Energie%20Cottbus">Energie Cottbus</a>, Stuttgart came back to win 2–1 and claim their first Bundesliga title in 15 years. The victory celebrations in Stuttgart, totalling 250,000 people, even topped those of <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a>'s third place win over <a href="Portugal%20national%20football%20team">Portugal</a> in the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>.
In addition, VfB had their first ever chance to win the <a href="double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> as they also reached the final of the German Cup for the first time since their victory there ten years former. Their opponents in the cup final in Berlin were 1. FC Nürnberg, a team that had beaten them twice by three goals in regular season, 3–0 and 4–1, and had last won the cup in 1962. With the game level at 1–1 in the first half, Stuttgart's scorer <a href="Cacau">Cacau</a> was sent off. Nürnberg gained a 2–1 lead early in the second half, but the ten men of VfB managed to fight back and equalize. In the second half of extra time, however, with both teams suffering from exhaustion and the humid conditions, Nürnberg scored the winning goal.
2007 to 2018: roller coaster rides.
2007–08 UEFA Champions League.
The 2007–08 UEFA Champions League draw on 30 August 2007 paired the German champions with <a href="La%20Liga">Spanish</a> giants <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="Ligue%201">French</a> champions <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a> and <a href="Scottish%20Premier%20League">Scottish</a> <a href="Old%20Firm">Old Firm</a> side <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>. Like in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League season, Stuttgart's 2007–08 European campaign started with a match at <a href="Ibrox%20Park">Ibrox Park</a> in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> against Rangers. It ended in a 2–1 defeat. The second match at home against Barcelona was likewise lost, 0–2, as well as the third match, against Lyon at home, with the visitors coming out 2–0 winners from two-second-half strikes. Five defeats and just one win (over Rangers) meant the early exit on the European stage. In the league, they managed to finish in sixth place after a poor start. New German international star Mario Gómez scored 19 goals.
Subsequently, UEFA Cup qualification was ensured in the summer by succeeding in the <a href="2008%20UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup</a>.
Post-championship seasons 2008–12.
The <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Bundesliga">2008–09 season</a>, like the one before it, got off to a bad start. After matchday 14 in November, VfB was only 11th in the table and as a result, Armin Veh was sacked and replaced by <a href="Markus%20Babbel">Markus Babbel</a>. After exiting the German Cup after a 1–5 thrashing from Bayern Munich in January, prospects improved considerably and the team ended third in the table, with second place just being missed after a loss to Bayern on the last matchday. That meant the chance of making the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> again.
Internationally, VfB mastered the group stages of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">2008–09 UEFA Cup</a>, but lost to Cup defenders <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">Zenit Saint Petersburg</a> in the round of the last 32 in February.
Stuttgart went into the 2009–10 season with Mario Gómez leaving for Bayern Munich, just as <a href="Pavel%20Pogrebnyak">Pavel Pogrebnyak</a> arrived from Zenit Saint Petersburg and Alexander Hleb returning on loan from Barcelona.
On the European level, Stuttgart started the season with a huge success by qualifying for the group stage of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2009–10 UEFA Champions League</a>. Stuttgart entered that competition for the third time in six years (after 2003 and 2007) by defeating Romanian side <a href="FC%20Politehnica%20Timi%C8%99oara">Politehnica Timișoara</a> in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20qualifying%20phase%20and%20play-off%20round">Champions League play-off round</a> on 18 and 26 August 2009. VfB were then drawn into Group G against Spanish side <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, Scottish champions Rangers, against whom they had also been drawn against in their previous two Champions League Group stage appearances, and Romanian champions <a href="FC%20Unirea%20Urziceni">Unirea Urziceni</a>. With two wins (one each against Rangers and Unirea), three draws (one each against all opponents) and a loss (to Sevilla) they managed second spot in the group, thus qualifying for the round of the last 16, where they had to face title holders Barcelona in late winter. After a superb home game against Barça which Stuttgart, however, did not manage to win (1–1), they were eliminated in a 4–0 rout at <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a>.
In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20DFB-Pokal">2009–10 DFB-Pokal</a>, they did not proceed further than the last 16 either, losing to second-tier side <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">SpVgg Greuther Fürth</a>. That defeat came in the course of a disappointing first half of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Bundesliga">2009–10 Bundesliga</a>. As a consequence of slipping to 16th spot in December, young coach Markus Babbel was fired after matchday 15 and replaced by the more experienced Swiss <a href="Christian%20Gross">Christian Gross</a>. Under his tenure, VfB improved their situation domestically as well as internationally before the winter break. During that break, <a href="Thomas%20Hitzlsperger">Thomas Hitzlsperger</a>, <a href="Jan%20%C5%A0im%C3%A1k">Jan Šimák</a> and <a href="Ludovic%20Magnin">Ludovic Magnin</a> left the club; <a href="Cristian%20Molinaro">Cristian Molinaro</a> was loaned out from <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>. In the later half of the season, the team – as in the 2008–09 season – had a fantastic, almost unbroken, winning streak. As the best team of that second (return) round of the Bundesliga, the Swabians under Gross climbed into the upper half of the table and, after a sensational rally, eventually managed to secure European football for the following season by qualifying for the Europa League.
The <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a> was a mediocre one—after again spending the first half of the season almost always in the <a href="relegation">relegation</a> zone (17th and 18th spot), with Christian Gross being fired and interim coach <a href="Jens%20Keller">Jens Keller</a> taking over for the rest of the first leg, <a href="Bruno%20Labbadia">Bruno Labbadia</a> was hired as new coach in January and managed to save VfB from relegation. Eventually, the team finished 12th after a decent second-half performance. In July 2011, Erwin Staudt did not participate again in the election of the president and <a href="Gerd%20E.%20M%C3%A4user">Gerd E. Mäuser</a> was elected as president.
In the following <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Bundesliga">2011–12</a> season, they managed to constantly climb up the table; this was especially thanks to a long unbeaten streak in the spring. Subsequently, VfB qualified for the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2012–13 UEFA Europa League</a>. Key players during that season were <a href="Martin%20Harnik">Martin Harnik</a>, who scored 17 goals, as well as winger <a href="G%C5%8Dtoku%20Sakai">Gōtoku Sakai</a> and forward <a href="Vedad%20Ibi%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Vedad Ibišević</a>, who both came to Stuttgart in January 2012.
With effect from 3 June 2013, Gerd E. Mäuser announced his resignation as president of VfB Stuttgart. On 2 July 2013, the supervisory board of the club named <a href="Bernd%20Wahler">Bernd Wahler</a> as the candidate for the presidential elections. On 22 July 2013, Wahler was elected by 97.4% of the votes cast.
After barely avoiding relegation from the Bundesliga in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15 season</a>, Stuttgart were relegated to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16 season</a> after finishing in 17th place, having been unable to lift themselves out of the bottom three positions until the end of the season. Following matchday 13, a home match against FC Augsburg and their second consecutive 4–0 loss, Stuttgart decided to terminate <a href="Alexander%20Zorniger">Alexander Zorniger</a>'s contract and appointed <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Kramny">Jürgen Kramny</a> as their manager for an indefinite period. After Stuttgart were relegated to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, Wahler resigned as president on 15 May 2016. Kramny was subsequently sacked as coach.
On 17 May 2016, <a href="Jos%20Luhukay">Jos Luhukay</a> was announced as the new head coach. In July 2016, <a href="Jan%20Schindelmeiser">Jan Schindelmeiser</a> became the sporting director and member of the executive board. Head coach Luhukay resigned on 15 September 2016 and was replaced by <a href="Hannes%20Wolf%20%28football%20manager%29">Hannes Wolf</a>. At the end of the season, Stuttgart returned to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> as the 2. Bundesliga champions. On 22 December 2017, after nearly 10 years since his departure, Bundesliga title winning striker Mario Gomez returned to the team from fellow Bundesliga side <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">VfL Wolfsburg</a>, The team made a solid return season to the Bundesliga, finishing in 7th place. However, they slumped to 16th <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Bundesliga">the following season</a>, eventually ending up relegated via play-offs against <a href="1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">Union Berlin</a>.
2019 – present.
Stuttgart appointed <a href="Thomas%20Hitzlsperger">Thomas Hitzlsperger</a> as the sporting CEO, and in April they appointed <a href="Sven%20Mislintat">Sven Mislintat</a> as the sporting director, coming from <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> and <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. In July 2019, Stuttgart was relegated to the second division, and started to rebuild the team. In mid-season, December 2019, former coach <a href="Tim%20Walter">Tim Walter</a> was fired and <a href="Pellegrino%20Matarazzo">Pellegrino Matarazzo</a> was signed. After one season, Stuttgart returned to the Bundesliga after finishing second in the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%202.%20Bundesliga">2019–20 2. Bundesliga season</a>. In 2020, the contract of Mislintat was prolonged to give him more responsibility.
Stuttgart stayed in the Bundesliga in the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20VfB%20Stuttgart%20season">2020–21 season</a>, finishing in ninth place in the league.<ref name="Bundesliga Tabelle 2020/21"></ref> In the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20VfB%20Stuttgart%20season">2021–22 season</a>, the team narrowly avoided relegation; a last-minute-win against <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> on the last match day guaranteed them a spot in the first league for a third consecutive season. In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20VfB%20Stuttgart%20season">2022–23 season</a>, Stuttgart managed to stay in the Bundesliga for a fourth consecutive season, but again only very closely, with Stuttgart finishing in 16th place and only qualifying for the next season thanks to successful play-offs.
The first half of the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20VfB%20Stuttgart%20season">2023–24 season for Stuttgart</a> has been one of the most successful ones of the club's history, Stuttgart was frequently called "the surprise team of the season". They remained on position 3 of the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> for most of the matchdays until today, only behind Leverkusen and Bayern, and also reached the quarter-finals in <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20DFB-Pokal">the current DFB Pokal</a>, where they defeated <a href="1.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin">1.

Stadium.
The home ground of VfB Stuttgart is the <a href="MHPArena">MHPArena</a> which was originally built in 1933. It lies close to the River <a href="Neckar">Neckar</a> on <a href="Bad%20Cannstatt">Bad Cannstatt</a>'s Mercedesstraße near the new <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20Museum">Mercedes-Benz Museum</a> and <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> factory. After being renovated several times, the stadium was able to hold a maximum capacity of 55,896 spectators (50,000 for international matches). For the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 FIFA World Cup</a>, the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion (its original name) was one of the venues for the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>, hosting five preliminary round matches, a first knockout round match (<a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> vs. <a href="Ecuador%20national%20football%20team">Ecuador</a>) and the third place play-off (<a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a> vs. <a href="Portugal%20national%20football%20team">Portugal</a>). From the 2008–09 season, the stadium was named the Mercedes-Benz-Arena, starting with a pre-season friendly against Arsenal on 30 July 2008. The stadium recently went through extensive restructuring and rebuilding as it was being converted into a pure football arena. In 2011, the capacity was increased to 60,449.
Rivalries, friendships and cooperations.
The longest rivalry of VfB is the city rivalry with <a href="Stuttgarter%20Kickers">Stuttgarter Kickers</a> ("Die Roten"/"Reds" against "Die Blauen"/"Blues"). However, the respective first teams of the two clubs haven't played each other since Kickers were relegated to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in 1992. Thus, this derby has increasingly been overtaken in importance by the Baden-Württemberg-Derby between VfB and <a href="Karlsruher%20SC">Karlsruher SC</a>. In this derby, old <a href="Badenese">Badenese</a>-<a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a>ian animosities are played out. The rivalry with Bavarian side <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> ("Süd-/South Derby") is mainly one-sided, as VfB fans are angry at Bayern for buying some of Stuttgart's best players and coaches in recent years, such as <a href="Giovane%20%C3%89lber">Giovane Élber</a>, <a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a>, <a href="Mario%20G%C3%B3mez">Mario Gómez</a>, and <a href="Benjamin%20Pavard">Benjamin Pavard</a>.
Regional friendships exist between VfB and the South <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a> side <a href="SSV%20Reutlingen%2005">SSV Reutlingen 05</a> (the "little brother" of VfB) as well as with North Württembergers <a href="SpVgg%20Ludwigsburg">SpVgg Ludwigsburg</a> but also with Heidenheim <a href="FC%20Heidenheim">FC Heidenheim</a>. On a national level, supporters groups of VfB used to be closely connected with those of <a href="FC%20Energie%20Cottbus">Energie Cottbus</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a>, <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> and <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>. All of these supporter group friendships have been discontinued by today or are only maintained by few supporter groups. Current ultras friendships are with the ultras of SSV Reutlingen 05 and Italian club <a href="A.C.%20Cesena">Cesena</a>.
In 2005, a cooperation treaty between VfB and <a href="Swiss%20Super%20League">Swiss Super League</a> side <a href="FC%20St.%20Gallen">St. Gallen</a> was signed, with particular emphasis on the youth sectors of both clubs.

1. FC Union Berlin

1. Fußballclub Union Berlin e. V., commonly known as 1. FC Union Berlin () or Union Berlin, is a professional <a href="Football%20in%20Germany">German football club</a> based in <a href="K%C3%B6penick">Köpenick</a>, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>.
The club's origins can be traced to 1906, when its predecessor FC Olympia Oberschöneweide was founded. During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, Union was based in <a href="East%20Berlin">East Berlin</a>, joining the German league structure upon the reunification of the city and country in 1990. From 2009 until 2019, they competed in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, the second tier of German football. In 2019, Union won promotion to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> for the first time in the club's history. In 2021, Union finished seventh in the league to qualify to the inaugural <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League">UEFA Europa Conference League</a>. In 2022, the club qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> by finishing fifth. The following season, the club qualified for the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> for the first time in their history, by finishing fourth in the Bundesliga.
The home ground of the club is the <a href="Stadion%20An%20der%20Alten%20F%C3%B6rsterei">Stadion An der Alten Försterei</a>. It is the second-largest in the German capital and has been home to Union Berlin and its forerunners since it opened in 1920. The stadium also hosts concerts and the annual Weihnachtssingen Christmas carols event.
 Union Berlin has 45,000 official members. The club has become well known for its enthusiastic and creative fan base and its <a href="football%20chant">chant</a> "Eisern Union" (Iron Union).
History.
First foundation (1906–1945).
The name 1. FC Union Berlin was used by two football clubs that shared a common origin as "FC Olympia Oberschöneweide", founded in 1906 in <a href="Obersch%C3%B6neweide">Oberschöneweide</a>, which at that time was a suburb of Berlin. The side took on the name SC Union 06 Oberschöneweide in 1910. Union was one of Berlin's premier clubs in the interwar period, regularly winning local championships and competing at the national level, including an appearance in the <a href="1923%20German%20football%20championship">1923 German championship</a> final which they lost 0–3 to <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>.
Early on, the team was nicknamed "Schlosserjungs" (English: metalworker-boys) because of their then all blue kit, reminiscent of the typical work clothing worn in the factories of the industrial Oberschöneweide district. The popular cry of Union supporters – "Eisern Union!" (Iron Union) – also emerged at this time. Since its foundation the club has had a distinct working-class image, in contrast to other local clubs with more middle-class origins, such as <a href="Viktoria%2089%20Berlin">Viktoria 89 Berlin</a>, <a href="Blau-Wei%C3%9F%2090%20Berlin">Blau-Weiß 90 Berlin</a>, <a href="BSV%2092%20Berlin">BSV 92 Berlin</a> or <a href="Tennis%20Borussia%20Berlin">Tennis Borussia Berlin</a>.
In 1933, German football was reorganized under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> into 16 top-flight divisions known as Gauligen. Oberschöneweide became part of the <a href="Gauliga%20Berlin-Brandenburg">Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg</a>, where they generally earned middling, unexceptional results. They were relegated in 1935 and returned to first division play in 1936 after only one season's absence. In 1940, the team finished first in Group B of the division and then defeated Blau-Weiß 90 (1–2, 3–0) to win the overall division title. That advanced the club to the national playoffs where they were put out by <a href="Rapid%20Wien">Rapid Wien</a> in the opening group round (2–3, 1–3). Union resumed its place as an unremarkable side. They were relegated again in 1942 and played the final war-shortened Gauliga season in 1944–45.
Dissolution and split (1945–1961).
After World War II, occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of all organizations in Germany, including sports and football associations. A new sport community called SG Oberschöneweide was formed in late 1945 and it played in the City League organized immediately after the war which had four regional departments. The team did not qualify to the newly created Oberliga Berlin (I) in 1946 after a poor season, but was promoted in 1947, won the division title right away and regained club status as SG Union Oberschöneweide during 1948–49.
The club finished the 1949–50 season in second place in Berlin and qualified to take part in the national final rounds. However, escalating Cold War tensions led Soviet authorities to refuse the team permission to travel to take part. Two Union teams then emerged as most players and coaches fled to the west to form <a href="SC%20Union%2006%20Berlin">Sport-Club Union 06 Berlin</a> which took part in the scheduled playoff match in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> against <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>, losing 0–7.
The players remaining in the east carried on as SG Union Oberschöneweide while a number of players who had fled to the west to form SC organized a third side called <a href="BBC%20S%C3%BCdost">Berliner Ballspiel-Club Südost</a>. The western team was a strong side until the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, drawing huge crowds to matches in the Olympiastadion. The division of the city led to a change of fortunes for BBC Südost which plays today in the lower divisions before meagre crowds.
Restart as Union Berlin (1961–1990).
The eastern branch of the club went through a number of name changes: Union Oberschöneweide (1950), BSG Motor Oberschöneweide (1951), SC Motor Berlin (1955), TSC Oberschöneweide (1957), TSC Berlin (1963) – finally becoming the <a href="Football%20club%20%28East%20Germany%29">football club</a> 1. FC Union Berlin in 1966.
1. FC Union Berlin was founded during the reorganization of East German football in December 1965 and January 1966, when ten dedicated <a href="Football%20club%20%28East%20Germany%29">football clubs</a> were created. However, the football department of TSC Berlin was originally not taken into account. Only two clubs were planned for East Berlin, to be formed from the football departments of <a href="1.%20FC%20Frankfurt">ASK Vorwärts Berlin</a> and <a href="SC%20Dynamo%20Berlin">SC Dynamo Berlin</a>. This was already contrary to the original plan, which had envisioned only one football club per district. And the football department of TSC Berlin was only playing in the second tier <a href="DDR-Liga">DDR-Liga</a> at the time.
1. FC Union Berlin was allegedly founded on the initiative of the powerful <a href="Herbert%20Warnke">Herbert Warnke</a>. Herbert Warnke was the chairman of the state-controlled national trade union <a href="Free%20German%20Trade%20Union%20Federation">FDGB</a> and a member of the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a> <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a>. Another SED politician and Politburo member who pushed for the founding of 1. FC Union Berlin was the SED First Secretary in East Berlin <a href="Paul%20Verner">Paul Verner</a>. Both ASK Vorwärts Berlin and SC Dynamo Berlin were associated with the armed organs (). Warnke therefore argued for the creation of a third "civilian club" for the working people in East Berlin. He would become a passionate fan of 1. FC Union Berlin and a sponsoring member of the club.
1. FC Union Berlin was established in the middle of one of the largest industrial centers in East Germany. 1. FC Union Berlin was initially supported by the FDGB. The intention of the SED to win the support from FDGB for 1. FC Union Berlin was likely well thought out. The FDGB unified all workers in East Germany and therefore was most likely to carry the proper identity for a club of the working people. The club was founded in a ceremony in the clubhouse of VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneheide "<a href="Karl%20Liebknecht">Karl Liebknecht</a>" (TRO) in <a href="Obersch%C3%B6neweide">Oberschöneweide</a> on 20 January 1966. The founding of the club was organized by the then-SED First Secretary in <a href="K%C3%B6penick">Köpenick</a>, <a href="Hans%20Modrow">Hans Modrow</a>. Like Herbert Warnke, Hans Modrow would be a sponsoring member of the club. SED Politburo member Paul Verner held a speech at the inaugural meeting.
1. FC Union Berlin was the only football club not playing in the <a href="DDR-Oberliga">DDR-Oberliga</a> at the time of its founding. As a dedicated football club, it was elevated into the upper tier of privileged elite clubs. The official sponsor of 1. FC Union Berlin was the state-owned <a href="combine%20%28enterprise%29">combine</a> VVB Hochspannungsgeräte und Kabel, which implemented its support through VEB Kabelwerk Oberspree, VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneweide and other local <a href="Volkseigener%20Betrieb">state-owned enterprises</a>. The first club president was the general director of VVB Hochspannungsgeräte und Kabel, Werner Otto, and his deputy was the SED Second Secretary in East Berlin, Hans Wagner. Even as a "civilian club", 1. FC Union Berlin was part of the state sports political system. The most important positions on the board of 1. FC Union Berlin would exclusively be held by directors of state-owned factories or <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a> representatives. 1. FC Union Berlin was state-funded and all club decisions had to be reported to the all-powerful central sports agency <a href="Deutscher%20Turn-%20und%20Sportbund">DTSB</a>. In turn, the DTSB stood under direct control of the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany%23Central%20Committee">SED Central Committee</a>.
The support from the FDGB ended when Herbert Warnke was replaced by <a href="Harry%20Tisch">Harry Tisch</a> as the chairman of the FDGB in 1975. Tisch had begun his political career in <a href="Rostock">Rostock</a> and instead gave his support to <a href="FC%20Hansa%20Rostock">FC Hansa Rostock</a>. This event was remarkable, as it revealed the large influence that high-ranking politicians exerted on football in East Germany. 1. FC Union Berlin would then had to rely on support from the regional district administration of the ruling <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a> party in <a href="East%20Berlin">East Berlin</a> and local state-owned enterprises. The main sponsors would be VEB Kabelwerk Oberspree (KWO), VEB Transformatorenwerk Oberschöneweide (TRO) and VEB Werk für Fernsehelektronik (WF). 1. FC Union Berlin developed a bitter rivalry with <a href="BFC%20Dynamo">BFC Dynamo</a>, which was supported by the <a href="Stasi">Stasi</a>. While their arch rivals won 10 titles in a row, Union yo-yoed between the <a href="DDR-Oberliga">DDR-Oberliga</a> and the <a href="DDR-Liga">DDR-Liga</a> with very little success. Union managed to win the <a href="FDGB%20Pokal">East German Cup</a> in 1968 when they defeated <a href="FC%20Carl%20Zeiss%20Jena">FC Carl Zeiss Jena</a> 2–1 although they lost in their second cup appearance in 1986 to <a href="1.%20FC%20Lokomotive%20Leipzig">1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig</a> by a score of 1–5.
The East German state-owned film studio <a href="DEFA">DEFA</a> produced a documentary about the supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin in 1989. The documentary is called "And Fridays at the Green Hell" and follows a group of supporters of 1. FC Union Berlin to both home and away matches during the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20DDR-Oberliga">1987–88</a> season.
2. Bundesliga era (1990–2019).
After <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a> in 1990, the team continued to perform well on the field, but almost collapsed financially. They managed to hang on through some tight times and find sponsorship, but only after winning their division in both 1993 and 1994 and each time being denied a license to play in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> due to their financial problems. The club had another close brush with financial failure in 1997.
Union again came close to advancing to the 2. Bundesliga in 1998–99 and 1999–2000, but were disappointed. They were finally successful in 2000–01, under <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>n manager <a href="Georgi%20Vasilev%20%28born%201946%29">Georgi Vasilev</a>, easily winning the Regionalliga Nord (III) and moving up a division to become the city's second most popular side. That same year they appeared in <a href="2001%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">the final</a> of the <a href="DFB-Pokal">German Cup</a> where they lost 0–2 to <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">FC Schalke 04</a>, and advanced as far as the second round in UEFA Cup before being put out by Bulgarian side <a href="PFC%20Litex%20Lovech">PFC Litex Lovech</a>. The club slipped to the <a href="Regionalliga%20Nord">Regionalliga Nord</a> (III) in 2004–05 and then to the <a href="NOFV-Oberliga%20Nord">NOFV-Oberliga Nord</a> (IV) in 2005–06, but returned to third division play after capturing the Oberliga title. In 2008–09, Union became one of the founding clubs of the new <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a>, and its inaugural champion, securing first place and promotion to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> on 10 May.
A controversy erupted in 2011 when it became publicly known that club president Dirk Zingler had been a member of the <a href="Felix%20Dzerzhinsky%20Guards%20Regiment">Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment</a> for three years during his military service. Only two years before, Zingler had cancelled a sponsorship deal with the company International Sport Promotion (ISP) because the head of the board at the company had been a Stasi officer. The Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment was the paramilitary wing of the Stasi. Zingler explained that he had sought to spend his military service in Berlin and that he was unaware beforehand that the regiment belonged to the Stasi. However, the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment was an elite formation; it was not possible to simply apply for the regiment. The Stasi selected who it thought were best fit to serve with the regiment, only accepting recruits who were "loyal to the line". Zingler had also been a member of the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">Socialist Unity Party</a> (SED) and leader in the <a href="Free%20German%20Youth">Free German Youth</a> (FDJ) at the time. Speaking about the reports on Zingler in 2011, Union Press spokesman Christian Arbeit said: "We do have a very unique history, compared to other clubs. But it wasn't us that always claimed we were this big anti-Stasi club. These are stories that get simplified in the media."
On 1 June 2018, Swiss coach <a href="Urs%20Fischer%20%28footballer%29">Urs Fischer</a> was announced as new head coach of the club. The team remained in the second tier until the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%202.%20Bundesliga">2018–19 season</a>, when they secured a first promotion to the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> after defeating <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> in the relegation play-offs. The club's supporters invaded the pitch after the victory, but no one was harmed.
Bundesliga era and European football (2019–present).
Union Berlin became the first Bundesliga club from the former East Berlin and the sixth from the former East Germany, after <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden">Dynamo Dresden</a>, <a href="F.C.%20Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20Lokomotive%20Leipzig">VfB Leipzig</a>, <a href="FC%20Energie%20Cottbus">Energie Cottbus</a>, and <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a>. The team is the sixth to win <a href="Promotion%20to%20the%20Bundesliga">promotion</a> from the 2. Bundesliga by beating the 16th-placed Bundesliga team in the playoff – since it began in the 1981–82 season, the others being <a href="Bayer%20Uerdingen">Bayer Uerdingen</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a>, <a href="Stuttgarter%20Kickers">Stuttgarter Kickers</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> and <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>. Ahead of Union Berlin's debut season in the Bundesliga, the club signed <a href="Neven%20Suboti%C4%87">Neven Subotić</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Ujah">Anthony Ujah</a> and <a href="Christian%20Gentner">Christian Gentner</a>, as well as re-signing <a href="Marvin%20Friedrich">Marvin Friedrich</a>, who had scored a decisive goal against Stuttgart in the play-offs in the previous season to secure promotion for the club. The first ever Bundesliga goal was scored by <a href="Sebastian%20Andersson">Sebastian Andersson</a> in a 1–1 draw against <a href="FC%20Augsburg">Augsburg</a>. On 31 August 2019, the club beat <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> 3–1 in a home game, a result that secured its first win in a Bundesliga game. The team finished the season in 11th place, with <a href="Sebastian%20Andersson">Sebastian Andersson</a> scoring 12 goals.
On 22 May 2021, in Union Berlin's second Bundesliga season, the club qualified for the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League">inaugural UEFA Europa Conference League</a> after finishing seventh, following a 2–1 home win against <a href="RB%20Leipzig">RB Leipzig</a>, with <a href="Max%20Kruse">Max Kruse</a> confirming Union Berlin's first European campaign in twenty years, with a 92nd-minute winner. In the following season, the club finished fifth in the league to qualify to the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>, where they reached the round of 16. In the 2022–23 season, Union Berlin qualified for the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> group stage for the first time in its history, after a 1–0 home win against <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> on the final matchday.
Stadium.
In 1920, SC Union Oberschöneweide (forerunner of today's 1. FC Union Berlin) had to find a new home ground as its former pitch had been built over by developers with residential buildings. The club moved a little further away from the city to the north-western part of the borough of <a href="K%C3%B6penick">Köpenick</a>. The new stadium was officially opened in August 1920 with a match between Oberschöneweide and the then <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">German champions</a> <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a> (1–2). The inaugural match in at the Alte Försterei had already been played on 17 March, when Union challenged <a href="Viktoria%2089%20Berlin">Viktoria 89 Berlin</a>.
When Union won promotion to the DDR-Oberliga (the top flight in <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>) in 1966, the stadium soon needed to be expanded. The ground was first expanded in 1970 when the Gegengerade terrace was raised, whilst further extensions to the terracing at both ends in the late 1970s and early 1980s increased the capacity furthermore to 22,500. However, the somewhat spartan facilities at Alte Försterei had quickly begun to show their age and went into a serious decline.
After <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, when Union were assigned by the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> to play in the third league, the outdated stadium proved only one of a number of factors that hampered the club's push for promotion to higher leagues.
In the middle of 2008, the club decided to finally modernise the stadium, the <a href="Stadion%20An%20der%20Alten%20F%C3%B6rsterei">Stadion An der Alten Försterei</a> (Old Forester's House). Money was still tight, and so the fans simply built the ground themselves. More than 2,000 Union supporters invested 140,000 working hours to create what is now regarded as the largest football-specific stadium in Berlin. During the redevelopment, Union played at the <a href="Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark">Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark</a>. Inside the stadium an array of outside beer kiosks and open air grills serving bratwurst and pork steaks at the back of the stand provide the culinary staples. The official opening on 12 July 2013, was celebrated with a friendly against Scottish Champions <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>. It holds 22,012 people with 3,617 seats. The rest is terracing.
World Cup living room.
In 2014, the club came up with the idea of inviting their fans to take their own sofas to the ground for the whole of the World Cup, to enjoy the televised matches in the company of fellow supporters. More than 800 sofas were placed on the pitch in rows in front of a big screen. The event was later recognized with the Fan Experience Award at The Stadium Business Summit 2015 in Barcelona.
Redevelopments of the Försterei and European Games.
In 2017, plans were announced to expand the Försterei from 22,012 to 37,000 with the installation of a new tier across the 3 stands that oppose the main stand. It was announced that the plans should start at the end of the 2023/24 season. The President of Union, Dirk Zingler stated that for the 2024/25 Season, Union Berlin will play at the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a> in the former West Berlin.
In 2021/22, Union Berlin played their <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League">UEFA Europa Conference League</a> Games at the Olympiastadion due to <a href="Terrace%20%28stadium%29">UEFA's ban of Terracing</a>, which was lifted in the 2022/23 season in favour of <a href="Safe%20standing">Safe Standing</a>. Union was able to play at the Försterei for the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2022/23 UEFA Europa League</a> campaign. Then, in the Wake of their Qualification to the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2023/24 UEFA Champions League</a>, Dirk Zingler confirmed that Union will be again playing at the Olympiastadion, as well as confirming that the Försterei will be used in the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20UEFA%20Youth%20League">UEFA Youth League</a>. This was not done in guidance of UEFA instead was done willingly. This is because of the demand of ticket sale being too much for the Försterei to handle, which was proven to be the case as in the UCL Season ticket sales, they sold out a total 120,000 tickets for all 3 Home Games (40,000 in each game) in one day

Club culture.
1. FC Union Berlin is recognized as one of Europe's "cult" clubs, based on many unique fan and club initiatives over the last two decades.
The nicknames of the club are "Eiserne" (the Iron Ones) or "Eisern Union" (Iron Union). These nicknames evolved from the earlier sobriquet "Schlosserjungs" (metalworker boys), a reference to the blue kit the Union played in, as it was reminiscent of the overalls worn by local workers.
In May 2004, the supporters raised enough money to secure the club's license for fourth-division football through a campaign called 'Bleed for Union'. This catchphrase was not meant metaphorically. One element of the campaign was that fans donated blood to Berlin hospitals and then gave the money they received from the blood bank to their club.
After 2010, Union Berlin became increasingly attractive for new Berliners, even internationals, who were drawn to the atmosphere at the club.
Rivalries.
During the East German era, 1. FC Union Berlin was known for a rivalry with <a href="BFC%20Dynamo">BFC Dynamo</a>, which was reputedly affiliated with the powerful state security service of East Germany (<a href="Stasi">Stasi</a>). Union, on the other hand, was supported by the regional district administration of the governing <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a> party and sponsored by local state-owned <a href="Volkseigener%20Betrieb">enterprises</a>. The club played some identificatory role in the unofficial opposition against the authorities of the communist system. Between 1979 and 1988, BFC Dynamo won ten consecutive East German league titles, with popular allegations of sporting misconduct helping to fuel the rivalry, and clashes between both sets of fans occurred. BFC Dynamo was seen as the supreme representative of the security agencies, with advantages in the recruitment of players and financial support, as well as the political clout of <a href="Erich%20Mielke">Erich Mielke</a>. An expression among the supporters of Union Berlin was: "Better to be a loser than a stupid Stasi pig". Supporters of Union cultivated the image of their club as the eternal underdog that was firmly rooted in the working class. Union became the most popular club in East Berlin.
It is said that fans of 1. FC Union Berlin often chanted "The wall must go!", with a reference to the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, when the opponents formed a wall during <a href="free%20kick">free kick</a>s in 1980s. However, some sources suggest that this is partly a myth and exaggerated. Supporters of Union saw themselves as stubborn and non-conformist. But this image should not be confused with actual resistance. For some supporters of Union, the dissident reputation is a legend that was created after "<a href="Peaceful%20revolution">Die Wende</a>". Honorary president of Union Günter Mielis has said: "Union was not a club of resistance fighters, but we had to fight against a lot of political and economic resistance over and over again. We got strength from our fans". Politics was not in the foreground. Most supporters of Union were just normal football supporters. There were no political groups at Union. A supporter of Union from the East German era has said: "With the best of intentions, Union fans did not contribute to the overthrow of the GDR. No way, we were interested in football. There is the cliché about the club for the enemies of the state, but that wasn't us". Another supporter said: "I think it's a myth that all Unioners were in the opposition. I think it was a basic attitude of the East German football youth in the 1970s and 1980s, that they were critical of the system."
Supporters of Union from the East German era have testified that the club was the most important thing, and the identification with Union had primarily to do with <a href="K%C3%B6penick">Köpenick</a>.
Despite 1. FC Union Berlin and <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> making up the two biggest clubs in Berlin, a rivalry between the two has been much less pronounced. Sympathies between supporters of the two clubs developed in divided Berlin. The first personal contacts between supporters of the two clubs occurred in the 1970s. Supporters of Hertha visited the <a href="Stadion%20An%20der%20Alten%20F%C3%B6rsterei">Stadion An der Alten Försterei</a> and supporters of Union accompanied the supporters of Hertha when Hertha played in the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> countries, such as the quarter finals in the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20UEFA%20Cup">1978–79 UEFA Cup</a> against <a href="Dukla%20Prague">Dukla Prague</a>. Chants and slogans such as "Ha-Ho-He, there are only two teams on the <a href="Spree%20%28river%29">Spree</a> – Union and Hertha BSC" () and "Hertha and Union – one nation" () became popular among the two sets of supporters. The two sets of supporters came together for the first time after the opening of the <a href="Berlin%20wall">Berlin wall</a> during the first edition of the indoor tournament "Internationales Berliner Hallenfußballturnier" in the <a href="Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle">Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle</a> on 18–20 January 1990. Supporters of Union and Hertha now also sang <a href="xenophobic">xenophobic</a> and <a href="nationalism">nationalist</a> chants. The teams of Hertha BSC and 1. FC Union Berlin also met in the tournament on 19 January 1990. It was the first ever meeting between the two sides. Hertha BSC won the match 3-2 in front of 4,000 spectators in Werner-Seelenbinder-Halle.
On 27 January 1990, 79 days after the fall of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, Hertha hosted Union Berlin at the <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a> in a friendly in front of 52,000 spectators. Fans of both clubs paid for admission in East and <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>'s respective currencies, and sang songs of <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, as Hertha won 2–1. Over twenty years later, on 17 September 2010, the duo faced each other for the first time in a competitive meeting, at the Stadion An der Alten Försterei, drawing 1–1 in the 2. Bundesliga. On 2 November 2019, Union Berlin faced Hertha at the Stadion An der Alten Försterei, in the first meeting between the clubs in German football's top flight. An 87th minute <a href="Sebastian%20Polter">Sebastian Polter</a> penalty secured a 1–0 win for Union, in a game temporarily suspended by referee <a href="Deniz%20Aytekin">Deniz Aytekin</a>, following fireworks thrown by Hertha fans, which landed amongst Union Berlin fans, as well as on the playing surface. 1,100 police officers were on duty for the game, with Hertha fans burning Union Berlin shirts, flags and scarves during the game. Hertha supporters had also been joined by 20–25 supporters of BFC Dynamo in the guest block. Following full time, Union Berlin goalkeeper <a href="Rafa%C5%82%20Gikiewicz">Rafał Gikiewicz</a> won praise from fans and media alike after ushering Union Berlin ultras from the field of play, following a minor pitch invasion devised to attack Hertha supporters.
Union Berlin also holds rivalries with <a href="F.C.%20Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a>, <a href="Dynamo%20Dresden">Dynamo Dresden</a>, and <a href="1.%20FC%20Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a>, dating to when the teams competed in the DDR-Oberliga.
More recently, the club has developed a rivalry with RB Leipzig, following the takeover of license and teams from fifth division side <a href="SSV%20Markranst%C3%A4dt">SSV Markranstädt</a> financed by <a href="Red%20Bull%20GmbH">Red Bull GmbH</a> and the ascension by Leipzig to the Bundesliga system. In 2011, Union Berlin ran adverts against the investment of the club whilst also cancelling a pre-season friendly with the club. On 21 September 2014, Union Berlin fans staged a silent protest for the first 15 minutes of a 2. Bundesliga home game against RB Leipzig, labelling RB Leipzig a "marketing product pushed by financial interests" with "brainwashed consumers in the stands". Union Berlin won the game 2–1. On 18 August 2019, during Union Berlin's first ever Bundesliga game, at home against RB Leipzig, the club's oldest <a href="ultras">ultras</a> group, the "Wuhlesyndikat", successfully called for a 15-minute silent protest at the start of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%201.%20FC%20Union%20Berlin%20season">club's 2019–20</a> opener.
Songs.
The official Union Berlin song is "Eisern Union" by German punk singer <a href="Nina%20Hagen">Nina Hagen</a>. The composition was recorded in 1998. Four versions were issued on a CD single by G.I.B Music and Distribution GmbH.
The famous supporters' chant 'Eisern Union' (Iron Union) bounces back and forth between the terraces named "Waldseite" and the "Gegengerade", and is followed by mutual acknowledging applause.
Christmas tradition.
Union Berlin is also well known for its Christmas traditions celebrated in their home stadium. In 2003, the yearly Union Weihnachtssingen started as an unofficial gathering to which just 89 fans showed up. In 2013, 27,500 people attended, including players and supporters of other teams from around Germany and Europe. Fans drink Glühwein (<a href="mulled%20wine">mulled wine</a>), wave candles around, light flares and sing a combination of Christmas carols and <a href="football%20chant">football chant</a>s.

History.
1899–1970.
On 4 February 1899, FV Werder Bremen was founded by a group of 16-year-old students who had won a football in a <a href="tug%20of%20war">tug of war</a> tournament. The name "Werder" is the German word for "river <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>", alluding to the riverside field on which the team played their first football matches. On 10 September 1899, Werder won their first match 1–0, against <a href="ASC%201898%20Bremen">ASC 1898 Bremen</a>. In 1900, the club was one of the <a href="Founding%20Clubs%20of%20the%20DFB">founder members</a> of the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB). Werder then had some early success, winning several local championships. In 1903, all three of their teams won their local leagues. Due to the club's popularity, Werder became the first side in the city to charge entry fees for home matches.
After the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, the club adopted other sports, such as <a href="Sport%20of%20athletics">athletics</a>, <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, <a href="chess">chess</a>, <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, and <a href="tennis">tennis</a>. On 19 January 1920, the club took on their current name: Sportverein Werder Bremen. In 1922, it became the first club in Bremen to hire a professional <a href="Coach%20%28association%20football%29">coach</a>, the Hungarian <a href="Ferenc%20K%C3%B3nya">Ferenc Kónya</a>. Werder made regular appearances in the <a href="Playoffs">play-offs</a> of the <a href="Northern%20German%20football%20championship">Northern German football championship</a> during the 1920s and early 1930s, but did not win any titles. In the mid-1930s, striker <a href="Matthias%20Heidemann">Matthias Heidemann</a> became the club's first <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">international</a>.
Werder won the <a href="Gauliga%20Niedersachsen">Gauliga Niedersachsen</a> in 1933–34, and again in 1935–36, 1936–37, and 1941–42. By winning the Gauliga, the team qualified for the national championship play-offs; Bremen's best result was a quarter-final place in <a href="1942%20German%20football%20championship">1942</a>. As <a href="Professionalism%20in%20association%20football">professionalism</a> was not permitted in German football, several Werder players worked at the nearby Brinkmann tobacco factory; the side were subsequently nicknamed "Texas 11" after one of the company's cigarette brands.
Between the end of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> and the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in 1963, the club was recognised as one of the top two teams in northern Germany, along with <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>. In <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20DFB-Pokal">1960–61</a>, Werder won their first <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, defeating <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> 2–0 in the final. The team consisted of future international <a href="Sepp%20Piontek">Sepp Piontek</a>, former international <a href="Willi%20Schr%C3%B6der">Willi Schröder</a>, and <a href="Arnold%20Sch%C3%BCtz">Arnold Schütz</a>, among others. A second place in the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Oberliga%23Oberliga%20Nord">1962–63 Oberliga Nord</a>, behind Hamburger SV, ensured Werder's place in the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Bundesliga">1963–64 Bundesliga</a>, the competition's inaugural season. Werder won their first German championship in <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20Bundesliga">1964–65</a>, finishing three points ahead of <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a>. One of the team's key players was German international and defender <a href="Horst-Dieter%20H%C3%B6ttges">Horst-Dieter Höttges</a>. Werder finished runners-up in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Bundesliga">1967–68</a>; in the following years, they languished in the bottom half of the table.
1970–2000.
In April 1971, during an <a href="Road%20%28sports%29">away</a> match at <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, the hosts' striker <a href="Herbert%20Laumen">Herbert Laumen</a> fell in Werder's <a href="Football%20pitch%23Goals">goal</a> net after a collision with Bremen <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> <a href="G%C3%BCnter%20Bernard">Günter Bernard</a>. The right goalpost snapped as a result of the impact, bringing the goal down, which could not be repaired nor replaced. The <a href="Referee%20%28association%20football%29">referee</a> abandoned the game with a scoreline of 1–1; the DFB later awarded the win to Werder. As a result of signing several expensive players, Bremen were nicknamed "Millionenelf". The team's form did not improve, and in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Bundesliga">1979–80</a>, Werder were <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> from the Bundesliga for the first time.
The team won the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%202.%20Bundesliga%23Nord">1980–81 2. Bundesliga Nord</a> title and were <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promoted</a> back to the Bundesliga. Manager <a href="Otto%20Rehhagel">Otto Rehhagel</a> was appointed in April 1981; under his guidance, Werder were Bundesliga runners-up in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Bundesliga">1982–83</a>, <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Bundesliga">1984–85</a> and <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Bundesliga">1985–86</a>. In 1983 and 1986, the side lost the title on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>. During the latter season, Werder hosted <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the penultimate match; Bremen needed to win to secure the title. In the last minutes of the game, Werder were awarded a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a>, which <a href="Michael%20Kutzop">Michael Kutzop</a> missed; the match ended goalless. Bayern won their last match, but Werder lost 2–1 to <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a>, meaning that Bayern won the title. Werder won their second Bundesliga title two years later, in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Bundesliga">1987–88</a>, only conceding a then-record 22 goals. They also reached the semi-final of <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20UEFA%20Cup">that year's UEFA Cup</a>. In the third round of the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20UEFA%20Cup">1989–90 UEFA Cup</a>, Bremen defeated defending champions <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a> 8–3 on aggregate, after winning 5–1 at home (<a href="Diego%20Maradona">Diego Maradona</a> was one of the Napoli players).
Werder reached the DFB-Pokal final in <a href="1989%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1989</a> and <a href="1990%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1990</a>, and were victorious in <a href="1991%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1991</a>. They also won the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1991–92</a>, beating <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">AS Monaco</a> 2–0 in the final. In <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Bundesliga">1992–93</a>, the team won their third Bundesliga title, and won their third DFB-Pokal in <a href="1994%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1994</a>. Bremen became the first German club to reach the group stage of the newly rebranded <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1993–94</a>. During that season, Werder trailed Belgian club <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a> 3–0 after 66 minutes. The side turned the game around and won 5–3; it is hailed as an example of the "Wunder von der Weser" (English: "Wonder of the Weser"). In this period, Werder had numerous internationals, including <a href="Mario%20Basler">Mario Basler</a>, <a href="Marco%20Bode">Marco Bode</a>, <a href="Andi%20Herzog">Andreas Herzog</a>, <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Riedle">Karl-Heinz Riedle</a>, <a href="Wynton%20Rufer">Wynton Rufer</a>, and <a href="Rudi%20V%C3%B6ller">Rudi Völler</a>.
Bremen finished runners-up in the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Bundesliga">1994–95 Bundesliga</a>; at the end of the season, after a then-national record 14-year stint at Werder, Rehhagel left the club for Bayern Munich. Rehhagel, Bremen's most successful manager, had employed a "controlled offensive" style of play, and worked on a tight budget during his reign. His successors (<a href="Aad%20de%20Mos">Aad de Mos</a>, <a href="Dixie%20D%C3%B6rner">Dixie Dörner</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Sidka">Wolfgang Sidka</a>, and <a href="Felix%20Magath">Felix Magath</a>) did not win any major honours. In May 1999, former Werder defender, and youth coach <a href="Thomas%20Schaaf">Thomas Schaaf</a> took over. He kept the team in the Bundesliga, and <a href="1999%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">won the DFB-Pokal only weeks later</a>, defeating Bayern on penalties.
2000–present.
Werder's league performance stabilized during the following seasons, regularly finishing in the upper half of the table. In <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Bundesliga">2003–04</a>, Bremen won both the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal, claiming the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> for the first time, becoming the third club in Bundesliga history to achieve this feat. The team also regularly qualified for the Champions League during the 2000s. In the last match of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06 Bundesliga</a> season, Werder won 2–1 at arch-rivals Hamburger SV to qualify for the Champions League, instead of Hamburg. Bremen reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Cup">2006–07 UEFA Cup</a>, in which they were eliminated by Spanish club <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">RCD Espanyol</a>. In <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20SV%20Werder%20Bremen%20season">2008–09</a>, the team reached the <a href="2009%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">UEFA Cup final</a>—losing 2–1 against Ukrainian side <a href="FC%20Shakhtar%20Donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a> after <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a>—and the <a href="2009%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">DFB-Pokal final</a>, defeating <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> by a scoreline of 1–0. In April and May 2009, Werder had played Hamburg four times in 19 days; once in the Bundesliga, twice in the semi-final of the UEFA Cup, and in the semi-final of the DFB-Pokal. Bremen defeated Hamburg 2–0 in the Bundesliga, and eliminated them from the DFB-Pokal and the UEFA Cup.
During this period, Werder had several players who were sold for large transfer fees, including <a href="Diego%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201985%29">Diego</a>, <a href="Torsten%20Frings">Torsten Frings</a>, <a href="Miroslav%20Klose">Miroslav Klose</a>, <a href="Mesut%20%C3%96zil">Mesut Özil</a>, and <a href="Claudio%20Pizarro">Claudio Pizarro</a>. In October 2010, Pizarro became the then-record foreign goalscorer in Bundesliga history. In 2013, Schaaf left the club by mutual consent after a 14th-place finish in the Bundesliga. In <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bundesliga">2019–20</a>, Bremen beat Köln 6–1 on the last matchday to finish in 16th place, overtaking <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a>; however, Bremen had to play the promotion-relegation play-offs against <a href="1.%20FC%20Heidenheim">1. FC Heidenheim</a> to avoid relegation. The tie ended 2–2 on aggregate, with Werder winning on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>, and avoiding relegation. Bremen finished 17th the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Bundesliga">following season</a>, and were relegated to the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> for the first time since 1979–80. The team finished runners-up in the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%202.%20Bundesliga">2021–22 2. Bundesliga</a> and won promotion back to the Bundesliga after one season.
Managers.
Werder have had 24 different managers since the beginning of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> era in 1963. <a href="Otto%20Rehhagel">Otto Rehhagel</a> served the longest term, holding the post for fourteen years. <a href="Hans%20Tilkowski">Hans Tilkowski</a>, <a href="Willi%20Multhaup">Willi Multhaup</a>, <a href="Rudi%20Assauer">Rudi Assauer</a>, and Otto Rehhagel served two terms each, while Fritz Langner served three.
Colours and crest.
Colours.
Werder Bremen's club colours are green and white, as referenced by the club song, "Lebenslang Grün-Weiß". The club's <a href="Home%20%28sports%29">home</a> shirts have often varied between green and white, though a predominantly white home shirt has not been used since 2008–09. There have been some exceptions to their traditional <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a> colours, such as from 1971 to 1973, when they adopted the city's colours of red and white, and in 1976, when they wore blue due to shirt sponsors Norda.
Crest.
Werder Bremen have used several crests during their history. Their first badge was created in 1899; a <a href="monogram">monogram</a>, which spelled "FVW", as the club was then known as "FV Werder Bremen". The logo was replaced in 1902 by a green-coloured crest, which spelled the founding year 1899 in the top left corner, "F.V.W." diagonally in the middle, and "Bremen" in the bottom right corner. In 1911, the inscriptions were placed diagonally, and the badge's colours were changed to black with a green diagonal stripe, along with a change in the crest's outline. In 1924, a green-coloured (with a white outline), oval-shaped crest with a large white-coloured "W" was created. The oval shape was replaced with a diamond one in 1929, to form the club's current crest, save for a spell in the 1970s when the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Bremen">coat of arms of Bremen</a> was used. In addition, a <a href="Star%20%28sport%20badge%29">star</a> is displayed above the crest on the team's shirts to represent their four Bundesliga titles.
Stadium.
Werder have played their home games at the same location since 1909. That year saw the construction of a <a href="sports%20venue">sports venue</a> with a wooden <a href="grandstand">grandstand</a>, built by the <a href="ATSV%201860%20Bremen">Allgemeinen Bremer Turn- und Sportverein</a>. In 1926, a new grandstand with dressing rooms and a restaurant were constructed, costing 1,250,000 <a href="Reichsmark">RM</a>. The venue was known as the "ATSB-Kampfbahn", and was also used for political mass gatherings. In 1930, it was called the "<a href="Weser-Stadion">Weserstadion</a>" for the first time. Five years later, the stadium was known as the "Bremer Kampfbahn", and in the following years, it was mostly used by the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>, as sporting activities were rarely practiced. Shortly after the Second World War, only American sports such as baseball and <a href="American%20football">American football</a> were played at the venue (now known as the "IKE-Stadium"). In 1947, the stadium was reopened as a shared sports venue, and was renamed "Weserstadion".
Following Werder's first Bundesliga title in 1965, the corner stands were expanded with a second tier. In 1992, Bremen became the first German club to install <a href="Luxury%20box">skyboxes</a>. In 2002, the <a href="cinder%20track">cinder track</a> was partially removed, thereby expanding the capacity. The Weserstadion was renovated from 2008 until 2011; the <a href="fa%C3%A7ade">façade</a> was coated with <a href="Photovoltaics">photovoltaic</a> panels, and a new roof was built on top of the old roof supporting structure. Both ends (east and west) were torn down and rebuilt parallel to the endline of the pitch, removing what was left of the old athletics track. The current capacity is 42,100.
Supporters and rivals.
Bremen have a long-standing rivalry with fellow northern German club <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>, known as the <a href="Nordderby">Nordderby</a> (English: "North derby"). It goes beyond football, as there also is a historic rivalry between the cities of <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a>, dating back to the Middle Ages. The cities are separated by one hundred kilometers, and are the two biggest <a href="Metropolis">metropolises</a> in northern Germany. <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> are another rival, dating back to the 1980s, when both sides were competing for domestic honours. Since the mid-2000s, Bremen fans have developed a dislike of <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>, after they poached several Werder players over the years, including <a href="A%C3%ADlton%20Gon%C3%A7alves%20da%20Silva">Aílton</a>, <a href="Fabian%20Ernst">Fabian Ernst</a>, <a href="Mladen%20Krstaji%C4%87">Mladen Krstajić</a>, <a href="Oliver%20Reck">Oliver Reck</a>, <a href="Frank%20Rost">Frank Rost</a>, and <a href="Franco%20Di%20Santo">Franco Di Santo</a>.
Bremen have seven <a href="Ultras">ultra</a> groups: "Wanderers-Bremen", "The Infamous Youth", "Caillera", "L'Intesa Verde", "HB Crew", "Ultra Boys", and "UltrA-Team Bremen". Werder fans maintain friendly relationships with <a href="Rot-Weiss%20Essen">Rot-Weiss Essen</a>, Austrian club <a href="SK%20Sturm%20Graz">SK Sturm Graz</a>, and Israeli clubs <a href="Maccabi%20Haifa%20F.C.">Maccabi Haifa</a>, and <a href="Hapoel%20Katamon%20Jerusalem%20F.C.">Hapoel Katamon Jerusalem</a>.
The anthem of Werder Bremen is "Lebenslang Grün-Weiß" by Bremen-based band Original Deutschmacher, which is also sung before every home game. After each Bremen goal, the song "<a href="I%27m%20Gonna%20Be%20%28500%20Miles%29">I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)</a>" by <a href="The%20Proclaimers">The Proclaimers</a> is played, preceded by the sound of a <a href="Air%20horn">ship's horn</a>.

Eintracht Frankfurt

Eintracht Frankfurt e.V. () is a German professional <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> based in <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, Hesse. It is best known for its <a href="football%20club">football club</a>, which was founded on 8 March 1899. The club currently plays in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, the top tier of the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system">German football league system</a>. Eintracht have won the <a href="List%20of%20German%20football%20champions">German championship</a> once, the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> five times, the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> twice and finished as runner-up in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> once. The team was one of the founding members of the Bundesliga at its inception and has spent a total of 54 seasons in the top division, thus making them the seventh longest participating club in the highest tier of the league.
Since 1925 their stadium has been the <a href="Waldstadion%20%28Frankfurt%29">Waldstadion</a>, which is currently named Deutsche Bank Park for sponsorship reasons.
Eintracht Frankfurt have had some success in the Bundesliga, having either won or drawn more than three-quarters of their games as well as having finished the majority of their seasons placed in the top half of the table, but also having the highest number of losses in the league (657). With an average <a href="List%20of%20sports%20attendance%20figures">attendance</a> of 47,942 since 2013 the team also has one of the highest attendance ratings in the world and the eighth highest out of the 36 Bundesliga and <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> teams. The player with the highest number of appearances (602) in the Bundesliga, <a href="Charly%20K%C3%B6rbel">Charly Körbel</a>, spent his entire senior career as a <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">defender</a> for Eintracht Frankfurt. The club's primary rival is local club <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a>, although, due to spending most of their history in different divisions, the two have only played two league matches within the last 40 years.
With almost 14,000 active athletes in over 50 sports in 2024, Eintracht Frankfurt is the largest <a href="multi-sports%20club">multi-sports club</a> in the world with a professional football team.
History.
Club origins.
The origins of the club go back to a pair of football clubs founded in 1899: "Frankfurter Fußball-Club Victoria von 1899" – regarded as the original team in the club's history – and "Frankfurter Fußball-Club Kickers von 1899". Both clubs were founding members of the new <a href="Nordkreis-Liga">Nordkreis-Liga</a> in 1909. These two teams merged in May 1911 to become "Frankfurter Fußball Verein (Kickers-Victoria)", an instant success, taking three league titles from 1912 to 1914 in the Nordkreis-Liga and qualifying for the Southern German championship in each of those seasons. In turn, "Frankfurter FV" joined the gymnastics club "Frankfurter Turngemeinde von 1861" to form "TuS Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861" in 1920. The German word "Eintracht" means 'harmony' or 'concord', and so "Eintracht" is the equivalent of "United" in English in the names of sports teams.
At the time, sports in Germany was dominated by nationalistic gymnastics organizations, and under pressure from that sport's governing authority, the gymnasts and footballers went their separate ways again in 1927, as "Turngemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861" and "Sportgemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt (FFV) von 1899".
Through the late 1920s and into the 1930s, Eintracht won a handful of local and regional championships, first in the <a href="Kreisliga%20Nordmain">Kreisliga Nordmain</a>, then in the <a href="Bezirksliga%20Main">Bezirksliga Main</a> and <a href="Bezirksliga%20Main-Hessen">Bezirksliga Main-Hessen</a>. After being eliminated from the national level playoffs after quarterfinal losses in 1930 and 1931, they won their way to the final in 1932 where they were beaten 2–0 by <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, who claimed their first ever German championship. In 1933, German football was re-organized into sixteen Gauligen under the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Third Reich</a>, and the club played first division football in the <a href="Gauliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Gauliga Südwest</a>, consistently finishing in the upper half of the table and winning their division in 1938.
Eintracht picked up where they left off after World War II, joining the new first division <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945-63%29">Oberliga Süd</a>. In 1946, Eintracht won the first <a href="Hessian%20Cup">Hessenpokal</a>, and finished third in the Oberliga Süd a year later. In 1953, they would win the Oberliga Süd title, qualifying Eintracht for the <a href="1953%20German%20football%20championship">German championship</a>, though they did not make it to the final.
National champions and European Cup finalists.
Former coach <a href="Paul%20O%C3%9Fwald">Paul Oßwald</a> returned to the club for third stint with Eintracht in 1958. In the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Oberliga">195859 season</a> the club won their Oberliga again, qualifying for the <a href="1959%20German%20football%20championship">1959 German championship</a>. Winning all six of the games in the group phase, Eintracht made it to the final with a perfect record; there, they would meet rivals <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a>, the club that Oßwald joined from, and the runners up behind Eintracht in the Oberliga Süd. Frankfurt went on to win the final 53 after extra time, becoming German champions for the first and so far only time in front of 75,000 fans in Berlin's <a href="Olympiastadion%20%28Berlin%29">Olympiastadion</a>.
As champions, Frankfurt would represent Germany in the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20European%20Cup">1959–60 European Cup</a>, where they would come to international prominence. Having beaten <a href="BSC%20Young%20Boys">BSC Young Boys</a> and <a href="Wiener%20Sport-Club">Wiener Sport-Club</a> to make it to the semi-finals, they were drawn against Scottish champions <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>, who were considered favourites, at least in Scotland – Rangers manager <a href="Scot%20Symon">Scot Symon</a> allegedly asked, "Eintracht, who are they?" before the game. Eintracht won the first leg 61 at home, in a performance described as the greatest in the club's history. They would score six more in the second leg at <a href="Ibrox%20Stadium">Ibrox</a>, winning 124 on aggregate. After the game, the Rangers players gave their opponents a guard of honour as they left the pitch.
Eintracht would return to Glasgow for the <a href="1960%20European%20Cup%20Final">final</a> at <a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a>, although they lost 7–3 to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> despite taking an early lead. The final was widely regarded as one of the best football matches ever played, remembered for a <a href="List%20of%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20hat-tricks">hat-trick</a> by <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a> and four goals by <a href="Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s">Ferenc Puskás</a>.
After their championship-winning year, Eintracht did not win the Oberliga again, though they were runners-up in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Oberliga">1961</a> and <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Oberliga">1962</a>. Both times they would finish second in the group phase of the German championship, missing out on the final.
Founding member of the Bundesliga.
The side earned themselves a place as one of the original 16 teams selected to play in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional football league, formed in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Bundesliga">1963</a>. Eintracht played Bundesliga football for 33 consecutive seasons, finishing in the top half of the table for the majority of them. In the inaugural season, Eintracht finished 3rd behind <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> and <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">Meidericher SV</a> – the club has still never managed a better Bundesliga finish – and also reached the <a href="1964%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1964 DFB-Pokal Final</a>.
Eintracht finished in the top half of the Bundesliga every season until <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Bundesliga">1970–71</a>. Although they didn't make it back to the European Cup, Eintracht did play in other non-UEFA European competitions, beating <a href="FK%20Inter%20Bratislava">FK Inter Bratislava</a> to win the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Intertoto%20Cup">1967 Intertoto Cup</a> in the last season of its original format. That year, they also reached the semi-final of the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>, losing to <a href="GNK%20Dinamo%20Zagreb">Dinamo Zagreb</a>.
Cup successes.
From 1973 to 1981, Eintracht had arguably their most successful period of the Bundesliga era, winning three <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>s and the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>. Many of the most iconic players from the club's history played during this era, such as <a href="Bernd%20Nickel">Bernd Nickel</a>, <a href="Charly%20K%C3%B6rbel">Charly Körbel</a>, <a href="Bernd%20H%C3%B6lzenbein">Bernd Hölzenbein</a>, <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Grabowski">Jürgen Grabowski</a> and <a href="Cha%20Bum-kun">Cha Bum-kun</a>.
The first title success came under <a href="Dietrich%20Weise">Dietrich Weise</a> in the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20DFB-Pokal">1973–74 DFB-Pokal</a>, winning 31 in the <a href="1974%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">final</a> over <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> – due to the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 FIFA World Cup</a>, which Hölzenbein and Grabowski had won with <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a>, the final wasn't played until August 1974.
Eintracht would win the cup again in 1975, beating <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a> 10. That season, they played in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> for the first time, and in the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1975–76</a> campaign, they would go far, reaching the semi-finals. Despite beating opponents <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham</a> 2–1 at home, Eintracht were beaten 31 in the second leg and were knocked out, while also finishing a relatively low ninth place in the Bundesliga. The club then had a difficult start to the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Bundesliga">1976–77</a> season, but under new coach <a href="Gyula%20L%C3%B3r%C3%A1nt">Gyula Lóránt</a>, appointed in November, Eintracht went unbeaten in the second half of the season. Lóránt, notable for introducing zonal marking to the Bundesliga, took Frankfurt into fourth place by the end of the season, finishing only two points behind champions <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>. Soon, however, Lóránt would leave for <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, with <a href="Dettmar%20Cramer">Dettmar Cramer</a> coming the other way to coach Frankfurt. Cramer left at the end of the disappointing <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Bundesliga">1977–78</a> season, replaced by <a href="Otto%20Knefler">Otto Knefler</a>, who soon had to leave on health grounds.
In January 1979, <a href="Friedel%20Rausch">Friedel Rausch</a> joined the club as the new coach. This was one of two important arrivals in 1979, as <a href="Cha%20Bum-kun">Cha Bum-kun</a> would sign for Eintracht in July, becoming the first Korean to play in Europe. He would quickly become an icon in Frankfurt, scoring 12 league goals in his debut season. Eliminating <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="CS%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti">Dinamo București</a>, <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> and <a href="FC%20Zbrojovka%20Brno">FC Zbrojovka Brno</a> in the earlier rounds of the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, Eintracht made it to the semi-finals, at which point only West German teams remained. Drawn against Bayern Munich, Eintracht pulled off a 5–1 win in extra time against the Bavarians to take their place in the final.
Rausch's side lost 3–2 in the first leg of the <a href="1980%20UEFA%20Cup%20final">final</a> to Borussia Mönchengladbach, the reigning champions. The two away goals, scored by <a href="Harald%20Karger">Harald Karger</a> and Hölzenbein, would prove crucial. Two weeks later, Eintracht hosted the return leg. With the score remaining 0–0 until late on, Rausch sent on teenager <a href="Fred%20Schaub">Fred Schaub</a> with 13 minutes to play. Almost immediately, Schaub scored what proved to be only goal of the game, giving Eintracht the title on away goals.
Now coached by <a href="Lothar%20Buchmann">Lothar Buchmann</a>, Eintracht won the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20DFB-Pokal">1980–81 DFB-Pokal</a>, their 3rd Pokal victory. This effectively marked the end of Eintracht's golden period, as they began to struggle against relegation.
Mid-80s struggles and 1988 DFB-Pokal.
In <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Bundesliga">1984</a>, they defeated <a href="MSV%20Duisburg">MSV Duisburg</a> 6–1 on aggregate in the relegation playoff after finishing 16th; in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Bundesliga">1986</a> and <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Bundesliga">1987</a>, they would finish 15th.
After years as a bottom-half club in the Bundesliga, Eintracht had a successful <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Bundesliga">1987–88</a> season, finishing in the top half of the league for the first time since 1982. More importantly, they won the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20DFB-Pokal">1987–88 DFB-Pokal</a>, with a 1–0 win over <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a> in the <a href="1988%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">1988 final</a>. The goalscorer was Hungarian <a href="Lajos%20D%C3%A9t%C3%A1ri">Lajos Détári</a>, who became a hero among the club's fans. Only two days after the final, Détári was sold to <a href="Olympiacos%20F.C.">Olympiacos</a> for a large fee, helping to pay the club's debts.
In <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Bundesliga">1988–89</a> Eintracht found themselves in the relegation fight again. <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Berger">Jörg Berger</a> was appointed coach and led the side to safety with a 4–1 aggregate win over <a href="1.%20FC%20Saarbr%C3%BCcken">1. FC Saarbrücken</a> in the relegation playoff.
Title challenges in the early 90s and first relegation.
A year later, Berger had taken the club to 3rd place, and was recognised as the best coach in the league. Berger left in 1991 after a 4th place finish, but the squad now included players considered among the Bundesliga's best, such as <a href="Uwe%20Bein">Uwe Bein</a>, <a href="Uli%20Stein">Uli Stein</a>, <a href="J%C3%B8rn%20Andersen">Jørn Andersen</a>, <a href="Manfred%20Binz">Manfred Binz</a>, <a href="Tony%20Yeboah">Tony Yeboah</a> and <a href="Andreas%20M%C3%B6ller">Andreas Möller</a>.
<a href="Dragoslav%20Stepanovi%C4%87">Dragoslav Stepanović</a> took over as coach when Berger left, and Eintracht would finish 3rd in both seasons he coached, although he left before the end of <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Bundesliga">1992–93</a>. Under Stepanović, Eintracht played what was considered some of the best football in Bundesliga history, making 'Stepi' a fan favourite to this day. In <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Bundesliga">1991–92</a>, the club came closer than ever before to winning the Bundesliga. Going into the last game of the season, Eintracht were top of the table and only needed a win against already-relegated <a href="FC%20Hansa%20Rostock">Hansa Rostock</a>. With the scores level at 1–1 Eintracht were denied what seemed a clear penalty, they would go on to lose 2–1. Referee Alfons Berg later apologised for his decision, but <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> became champions. Eintracht also came close in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Bundesliga">1993–94</a>, under <a href="Klaus%20Toppm%C3%B6ller">Klaus Toppmöller</a>, leading the table at the halway point; however, they fell to 5th place and Toppmöller was sacked.
In the summer of 1994, <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> was appointed coach. Things quickly began to turn sour, as Heynckes fell out with key players Tony Yeboah, <a href="Maurizio%20Gaudino">Maurizio Gaudino</a> and <a href="Jay-Jay%20Okocha">Jay-Jay Okocha</a>. The club suspended all three players; Yeboah and Gaudino soon left. With the club in 13th, Heynckes decided to leave. For his role in breaking up the successful side of the early 90s, Heynckes is still reviled by many fans in Frankfurt.
Relegation would come in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Bundesliga">1995–96</a>, with neither club legend Charly Körbel or the previously successful Dragoslav Stepanovic able to rescue Eintracht. After 33 consecutive years in the Bundesliga, Frankfurt went down alongside <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a>, who had also been ever-present until 1996.
Turbulent years.
After a tumultuous debut campaign in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a>, Eintracht won the title in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%202.%20Bundesliga">1997–98</a> and returned to the Bundesliga. Promotion coach <a href="Horst%20Ehrmantraut">Horst Ehrmantraut</a> left in December, and Jörg Berger returned to try to save Eintracht once more. On the final day of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Bundesliga">1998–99</a> season, Eintracht were expected to be relegated, but dramatically climbed out of the relegation zone on goal difference thanks to a late goal from <a href="Jan%20%C3%85ge%20Fj%C3%B8rtoft">Jan Åge Fjørtoft</a> giving them a 5–1 win over Kaiserslautern.
The following year, in another struggle to avoid relegation, the club was docked two points for violating the conditions of their license. Eintracht secured survival on the last day of the season with a win over <a href="SSV%20Ulm%201846">SSV Ulm</a>, who were relegated instead. Eintracht would go down the season afterwards with Friedel Rausch in charge, and did not come close to promotion in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%202.%20Bundesliga">2001–02</a>.
Eintracht secured a Bundesliga return on the final day of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%202.%20Bundesliga">2002–03</a> season with a 6–3 win over <a href="SSV%20Reutlingen%2005">Reutlingen</a>, dramatically scoring 3 in the last 10 minutes of the game. They were then relegated straight back to the 2. Bundesliga, but were promoted again the season after, managed by <a href="Friedhelm%20Funkel">Friedhelm Funkel</a>. Funkel led the team to safety in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Bundesliga">2005–06</a> and also took Eintracht to the <a href="2006%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">DFB-Pokal final</a> for the first time since 1988, where they lost to Bayern Munich. As Bayern had already qualified for Europe, this also meant that Eintracht qualified for the UEFA Cup. After years of stability under Funkel, <a href="Michael%20Skibbe">Michael Skibbe</a> replaced him in 2009.
The <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a> ended with the club's fourth Bundesliga relegation. After setting a new record for most points in the first half of the season, the club struggled after the winter break, going seven games without scoring a goal. Coach Skibbe was replaced with <a href="Christoph%20Daum">Christoph Daum</a>, but Eintracht went down again after winning just once in the second half of the season.
One year later, Eintracht defeated <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Alemannia Aachen</a> 3–0 on the 32nd matchday of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%202.%20Bundesliga">2011–12 season</a>, securing promotion to the Bundesliga. This was followed up by a 6th place finish in the Bundesliga in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bundesliga">2012–13</a>, qualifying Frankfurt for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>.

Having finished in the top half in <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Bundesliga">2014–15</a>, a season in which Eintracht's <a href="Alexander%20Meier">Alexander Meier</a> was the league's top scorer, the team struggled again in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Bundesliga">2015–16</a> and <a href="Niko%20Kova%C4%8D">Niko Kovač</a> was appointed coach in March 2016. Frankfurt survived only through the relegation playoff; ending the season in 16th place, they beat 1. FC Nürnberg 2–1 on aggregate in the playoff. In Kovač's first full year, his team survived comfortably and also reached the <a href="2017%20DFB-Pokal%20Final">final</a> of the <a href="2016-17%20DFB-Pokal">2017 DFB-Pokal</a>, where they were beaten by Borussia Dortmund.
Eintracht reached their second DFB-Pokal final in a row in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20DFB-Pokal">2017–18</a>, this time winning 3–1 against heavy favourites Bayern Munich – who Kovač had already agreed to join from next season. He was replaced by <a href="Adi%20H%C3%BCtter">Adi Hütter</a>.
In <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Bundesliga">2018–19</a>, Eintracht's attacking trio of <a href="Luka%20Jovi%C4%87">Luka Jović</a>, <a href="Ante%20Rebi%C4%87">Ante Rebić</a> and <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Haller">Sébastien Haller</a> won lots of praise for their outstanding performances, scoring 41 league goals and 16 <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> goals between them and earning the nickname "the Buffalo Herd". Making only their second appearance in the modern Europa League, Eintracht won all six group games against <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a>, <a href="Apollon%20Limassol%20FC">Apollon Limassol</a> and <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a>, and beat highly-rated opponents <a href="FC%20Shakhtar%20Donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a>, <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> and <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>.

Chelsea would go on to win the tournament. Eintracht also missed out on Champions League qualification in the Bundesliga, dropping from 4th to 7th after losing their last two games.
With Jović, Rebić and Haller all leaving in the summer of 2019, Eintracht regressed in <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Bundesliga">2019–20</a> and failed to qualify for Europe, but returned to the Europa League with a 5th place finish in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Bundesliga">2020–21</a>, after which Adi Hütter left for Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2021–22 Europa League</a>, Eintracht topped their group and stunned <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the quarter finals, taking a 3–0 lead at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> and eventually winning 3–2 with approximately 30,000 travelling Frankfurt fans in attendance.

Colours, crest and nicknames.
The club crest derives from the coat of arms of the city of <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, which itself is a reference to the one-headed <a href="Reichsadler">Imperial Eagle</a> of the 13th century.
The crest has evolved showing little significant change until 1980, when a stylized eagle in black and white was chosen to represent the team. In Eintracht's centenary year of 1999, the club decided to re-adopt a more traditional eagle crest. Since 2005, Eintracht has had a living mascot, a <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a> named "Attila" from the nearby <a href="Hanau">Hanau</a> Zoo, who has currently been present at over 200 different games.
The official club colours of red, black, and white have their origins in the colours of the founding clubs "Frankfurter FC Viktoria" and "Frankfurter FC Kickers", which sported red and white and black and white respectively. Red and white are the colours of the city coat of arms, and black and white the colours of <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>. When the clubs merged, officials decided to adopt the colours of both sides. Since local rival "<a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a>" sport the colours red and white, "Eintracht" avoids playing in such a kit, preferring to play in black and red, or in black and white. In the 2023–2024 season, the home kit is black and red.
In the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2021–22 UEFA Europa League</a>, the Eagles played an unbeaten campaign, mostly sporting an all-white kit that gained them the nickname "la bestia blanca" (literally "the white beast" in Spanish), a wordplay on the Spanish term "la bestia negra" (literally "the black beast", also meaning "bogey team" in Spanish). This nickname was received after Eintracht knocked FC Barcelona out of the competition at Camp Nou.
The club is nicknamed "Die Adler" ("The Eagles"), which derives from their logo. A nickname still popular among supporters is "SGE", taken from the club's old official name "Sportgemeinde Eintracht" (Frankfurt), which roughly translates into English as "Sports Community Harmony."
The nickname "Launische Diva" ("Moody Diva") was heard most often in the early 1990s, when the club would comfortably defeat top teams only to surprisingly lose to lesser clubs.
The nickname "Schlappekicker" ("Slipper Kickers") has been around since the 1920s, when "J. & C. A. Schneider", a local manufacturer of shoes and especially slippers (called "Schlappe" in the regional <a href="Hessian%20dialects">Hessian dialect</a>) was a major financial backer of the club and helped propel it to national relevance.
Since July 2022, the executive board consists of Axel Hellmann (CEO), <a href="Markus%20Kr%C3%B6sche">Markus Krösche</a> (head of sports) and Oliver Frankenbach (head of finances) and Philipp Reschke (head of fan relations, merchandising and HR).

Stadium.
The club's initial games from 1899 to 1906 were played on the former "Hundswiese" field, whose present day location would be near <a href="Hessischer%20Rundfunk">Hessischer Rundfunk</a>. Following new regulations that pitches needed to be surrounded by a fence for the purpose of official games, the team established a new pitch by the <a href="Eschersheim">Eschersheimer Landstraße</a> called "Victoriaplatz" in 1906, for which they purchased stands at a price of 350 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">marks</a> in 1908. From 1912 the team moved to a new ground at Roseggerstraße in <a href="Dornbusch%20%28Frankfurt%20am%20Main%29">Dornbusch</a> with more facilities, before relocating to the former <a href="Riederwaldstadion">Riederwaldstadion</a> in 1920 following the fusion of "Frankfurter FV" and "Frankfurter Turngemeinde von 1861."
The ground was inaugurated as Waldstadion ("Forest Stadium") in 1925 with the German championship final match between <a href="FSV%20Frankfurt">FSV Frankfurt</a> vs. <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>.
The facility was renovated for the FIFA World Cup 2006 in Germany. , for Bundesliga fixtures the maximum capacity is 58,000.
Though the media usually refer to the ground by the official name, Deutsche Bank Park, Eintracht fans faithful typically use the original name, Waldstadion.
Reserve team.
Eintracht Frankfurt U21 is the reserve team of Eintracht Frankfurt. The team played as U23 (Under 23) to emphasize the character of the team as a link between the youth academy and professional team. The club board decided to dissolve the team after the 2013–14 season while playing in the regular league system in the fourth tier, the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281994%E2%80%932012%29">Regionalliga Süd</a>. 
On 14 February 2022, Eintracht Frankfurt applied to have a reserves team to be re-admitted to the <a href="German%20football%20league%20system%23Hesse">5th tier</a> <a href="Hessenliga">Hessenliga</a> for the 2022–23 season.
In the first season after being re-admitted, Frankfurt II won the Hessenliga and got promoted to the <a href="Regionalliga%20S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga Südwest</a>, where they play now.
Rivalries and friendships.
The club's main rival is from across the <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a> river, the side <a href="Kickers%20Offenbach">Kickers Offenbach</a>. The clubs played the <a href="1959%20German%20football%20championship%20Final">1959 German championship final</a>, which Eintracht won.
Eintracht also maintain rivalries with <a href="SV%20Darmstadt%2098">Darmstadt 98</a> regionally, known as the "<a href="Hesse">Hesse</a> derby", as well with <a href="1.%20FSV%20Mainz%2005">1. FSV Mainz 05</a> and <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> in Rhineland-Palatinate.
The club's original rival was <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> city-rival <a href="FSV%20Frankfurt">FSV Frankfurt</a>. In both clubs' early years, there used to be a fierce rivalry, but after World War II Eintracht proved to be the stronger club and the ways parted and the rivalry deteriorated due to lack of contact. Nowadays, the fan relations tend to be friendly. 
The <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%202.%20Bundesliga">2011–12 season</a> saw Eintracht play FSV in a league match for the first time in almost 50 years. The last league game between the two had been played on 27 January 1962, then in the <a href="Oberliga%20S%C3%BCd%20%281945%E2%80%9363%29">Oberliga Süd</a>. For the first of the two matches, FSV's home game on 21 August 2011, the decision was made to move to Eintracht's stadium as FSV's <a href="Stadion%20am%20Bornheimer%20Hang">Bornheimer Hang</a> only holds less than 11,000 spectators. Eintracht won 4–0. The second match on 18 February 2012 ended in another victory for Eintracht, a 6–1 rout.
A friendship between two Eintracht fan clubs and supporters of English club <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a> has lasted for over 30 years after fans from each club met at an international football tournament. Small sections of each club's support will pay a visit to the other's ground at least once a season.

Although the footballers have enjoyed only modest success on the field, the club is widely recognised for its distinctive social culture and has a large popular following as one of the country's "Kult" clubs, which has now developed beyond Germany. FC St Pauli supporters are strongly identified with their support of <a href="left-wing%20politics">left-wing politics</a>.
History.
Early years.
The club began its existence in 1899 as a loose, informal group of football enthusiasts within the "Hamburg-St.Pauli Turn-Verein 1862". This group did not play its first match until 1907, when they faced a similar side assembled from the local Aegir swimming club. Officially established on 15 May 1910, the club played as "St Pauli TV" in the <a href="Kreisliga">Kreisliga</a> Groß-Hamburg (Alsterkreis) until 1924, when a separate football side called St Pauli was formed. The team played as an undistinguished lower-to-mid table side until making their first appearance in 1934 in the top-flight <a href="Gauliga%20Nordmark">Gauliga Nordmark</a>, 1 of 16 premier level divisions created in the re-organization of German football that took place under the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Third Reich</a>. They were immediately relegated, but returned to the top flight in 1936. Relegated again in 1940, St Pauli re-appeared in the <a href="Gauliga">Gauliga</a> Hamburg in 1942, and played there until the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.
Post-war football.
After the war, the club resumed play in the <a href="Oberliga%20Nord">Oberliga Nord</a> in 1947. A second-place finish in the 1947–48 season led St Pauli to its first appearance in the national championship rounds. They advanced as far as the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 2–3 by eventual champions <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>. The club continued to play well throughout the early 1950s, but were unable to overtake rivals <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>, finishing in second place in five of the next seven seasons, and going out in the early rounds in each of their championship-round appearances from 1949 to 1951. In the late 1950s and into the early 1960s, St Pauli were overtaken by rivals such as <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> and <a href="VfL%20Osnabr%C3%BCck">VfL Osnabrück</a>, but finished fourth a number of times.
Promotion to the Bundesliga.
In 1963, the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> – West Germany's new top-flight professional league – was formed. Hamburger SV, Werder Bremen, and <a href="Eintracht%20Braunschweig">Eintracht Braunschweig</a> joined the new circuit as the top-finishers from the Oberliga Nord, while FC St Pauli found themselves in the second-tier Regionalliga Nord. That year, the club signed <a href="Guy%20Acolatse">Guy Acolatse</a>, who became the first <a href="Black%20people">Black</a> professional footballer to play in Germany.
Nearly a decade-and-a-half of frustration followed. St Pauli won their division in 1964, but finished bottom of their group in the promotion play-off round. They won their next Regionalliga Nord title in 1966, but, while they performed far better in the play-offs, still could not advance to the top-flight, losing to <a href="Rot-Weiss%20Essen">Rot-Weiss Essen</a> on goal difference, having conceded two more goals. Division championships in 1972 and 1973, and runner-up finishes in 1971 and 1974, were each followed by promotion-round play-off disappointment.
The success of the Bundesliga, and the growth of professional football in West Germany, led to the formation of the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> in 1974. St Pauli was part of the new second-tier professional circuit in the 2. Bundesliga Nord and, in 1977, they advanced to the top flight as winners of their division. The team survived for one season at the highest level in the Bundesliga.
The club's return to the 2. Bundesliga Nord was also short-lived. On the verge on bankruptcy in 1979, they were denied a license for the following season and were sent down to the <a href="Oberliga%20%28football%29">Oberliga Nord (III)</a>. Strong performances that set the team atop that division in 1981 and 1983 were marred by poor financial health. By 1984, the club had recovered sufficiently to return to the 2. Bundesliga, overtaking Werder Bremen's amateur side, who, despite finishing two points ahead of St Pauli, were ineligible for promotion.
"Kult" phenomenon.
It was in the mid-1980s that St Pauli's transition from a standard traditional club into a "<a href="cult%20following">Kult</a>" club began. The club was also able to turn the location of its ground in the dock area part of town, near Hamburg's famous <a href="Reeperbahn">Reeperbahn</a> – centre of the city's night life and its <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a> – to its advantage. An alternative fan scene slowly emerged, built around <a href="left-wing%20politics">left-leaning politics</a>, <a href="activism">social activism</a> and the event and party atmosphere of the club's matches. Supporters adopted the <a href="Jolly%20Roger">skull and crossbones</a> as their own unofficial emblem. St Pauli became the first team in Germany to officially ban <a href="nationalism%23Types">right-wing nationalist activities</a> and displays in its stadium in an era when fascist-inspired <a href="football%20hooliganism">football hooliganism</a> threatened the game across Europe. In 1981, the team was averaging small crowds of only 1,600 spectators, but by the late 1990s they were frequently selling out their entire 20,000-capacity ground.
The skull and crossbones symbol had always been associated with St Pauli (the city quarter) in one way or another. Hamburg fostered the most famous pirate of Germany, <a href="Klaus%20St%C3%B6rtebeker">Klaus Störtebeker</a>, and the symbol had been used by the 1980s squatters at <a href="Hafenstra%C3%9Fe">Hafenstraße</a>. However, the one who should be credited with finally bringing the symbol to the terraces is probably Doc Mabuse, the singer of a Hamburg punk band. As the legend tells, he first grabbed the flag from a stall while passing drunk through the <a href="Hamburger%20Dom">Dom</a> on his way to the Millerntor-Stadion.
In the early 1990s, the media in Germany began to recognize the "Kult"-image of the club, focusing on the <a href="punk%20ideologies">punk</a> part of the fan-base in TV broadcasts of the matches. By this time, the media also started to establish nicknames like "Freibeuter der Liga" ("<a href="Buccaneer">Buccaneer</a>s of the League") as well as the satirical "das Freudenhaus der Liga" ("Brothel of the League", literally "House of Joy").
St Pauli moved in and out of the Bundesliga over the course of the next dozen years: the club was narrowly relegated to the Oberliga in the 1984–85 season, but won the 1985–86 championship and returned to 2. Bundesliga. Two increasingly strong years followed, resulting in promotion and three seasons in the Bundesliga, from 1988 to 1991. Four seasons followed in 2. Bundesliga, and then another two in the Bundesliga in 1995 to 1997, before another return to the 2. Bundesliga.
Into the new millennium.
Until 2010, the club's most recent appearance in the top-flight had been a single-season cameo in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Bundesliga">2001–02</a>. A win against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, the reigning <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> winners, led to the popular "Weltpokalsiegerbesieger" ("World Club Champion beaters") shirts. However, the team finished last in the league, partly because the management did not trust the team which surprisingly won the promotion in 2001, but rather spent the additional money from Bundesliga TV contracts and advertisements on expensive but disappointing players. After the relegation to the 2. Bundesliga, only a skeleton of the successful 2001 team remained. The <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%202.%20Bundesliga">2002–03 season</a> ended up in chaos, with the team fighting relegation (ultimately in vain) from the very beginning, various coaches departing and other problems internal to the club.
With the club almost bankrupt again and the less-lucrative <a href="Regionalliga%20%28football%29">Regionaliga Nord (III)</a> looming, the club began its fund-raising activities, the so-called "Retteraktion". They printed <a href="t-shirt">t-shirt</a>s with the club's crest surrounded by the word "Retter" ("rescuer/saviour") and more than 140,000 were sold within six weeks. They also organized a lucrative benefit game, against Bayern Munich, to raise funds to save the club.
The club has also been active in terms of charity and in 2005 the club, the team and the fans initiated the <a href="Viva%20con%20Agua%20de%20Sankt%20Pauli">Viva con Agua de Sankt Pauli</a> campaign, which collects money for water-dispensers for schools in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, for clean water in <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> et cetera.
During the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%202.%20Bundesliga">2005–06 season</a>, the team enjoyed unprecedented success in the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a>, with wins over <a href="SV%20Wacker%20Burghausen">Burghausen</a>, <a href="VfL%20Bochum">VfL Bochum</a> and, significantly, Bundesliga sides <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> and, in the quarter-finals on 25 January 2006, Werder Bremen. Their 3–1 victory in front of a sell-out Millerntor crowd, and their subsequent place in the DFB Cup semi-final, netted the club approximately €1 million in TV and sponsorship money, going a long way to saving the club from immediate financial ruin.
St Pauli finally went out of the cup to Bayern Munich on 12 April, going down 3–0 with a goal from <a href="Owen%20Hargreaves">Owen Hargreaves</a> and two from <a href="Claudio%20Pizarro">Claudio Pizarro</a>. Coincidentally, Bayern were also St. Pauli's opponents and dispatchers in the first round of <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20DFB-Pokal">the following season's cup</a>.
After success in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%202.%20Bundesliga">2006–07 season</a>, the team was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga. After defeating <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">SpVgg Greuther Fürth</a> in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%202.%20Bundesliga">2009–10 season</a>, the team secured promotion back to the Bundesliga for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Bundesliga">2010–11 season</a>. On 16 February 2011, during the 2010–11 season and for the first time since 1977, St Pauli defeated their bitter cross-city rivals Hamburger SV away at the <a href="Volksparkstadion">Volksparkstadion</a> courtesy of a <a href="Gerald%20Asamoah">Gerald Asamoah</a> goal. The team, however, finished the domestic season in last place, resulting in their relegation to the 2. Bundesliga for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%202.%20Bundesliga">2011–12 season</a>. Since then, the club has remained in the 2. Bundesliga, finishing fourth in 2011–12, but declining in results since then.
Colours and kit.
The colours of FC St Pauli are <a href="brown">brown</a> and <a href="white">white</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="red">red</a>. <a href="Black">Black</a> is also common among fans and on third kits.
The club has worn brown and white since 1910, when it joined the <a href="Northern%20German%20Football%20Association">Northern German Football Association</a> ("Norddeutscher Fußball-Verband"). These early uniforms were made up of brown shirts and socks with white shorts. Some time between the 1920s and 30s, the club took on what would become its traditional look, namely a white shirt, brown shorts and brown socks with a white turnover. From early on in the club's history until the 1990s, the club readily wore its brown <a href="Away%20colours">change shirts</a> at home, even during such games as those against rivals HSV, who also wear white shirts.
During the 1960s, the club introduced white socks which regularly alternated with plain brown socks. A motif was used on the club shirt for the first time in 1968, when the club donned stripes, and, in the 1970s, various other motifs adorned the club's first and second-choice shirts. In the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%202.%20Bundesliga">1976–77 season</a>, St Pauli began wearing <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> kits, marking the end of a period of often experimental shirts, and this traditional look continued when the club started wearing <a href="Puma%20%28brand%29">Puma</a> kits in the 1980s. For the 1985–86 season, the club sported an all-white Puma kit, which would be worn for four consecutive seasons before some brown details returned to the shirt. However, the Kiezkicker would continue to wear these predominantly white kits until 1993.
At this point, the club would return to a kit based on a white-brown-white scheme, but in a more contemporary style, often incorporating patterns. The <a href="Reusch%20%28company%29">Reusch</a> kits of <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%202.%20Bundesliga">1994</a>–<a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Bundesliga">96</a> and <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Bundesliga">1996–97</a> had hoops and stripes respectively, while <a href="Kappa%20%28brand%29">Kappa</a> would also produce a striped kit in 2000–01. The Italian brand would provide a set of kits for the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons in which the shirt, shorts, and socks were all available in white and brown, meaning that the team would wear a different combination each game, reminiscent of the club's look between the 1960s and 1980s. During the 2001–02 season, the team would frequently make recourse to the previous year's all-black away kit.
In <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Regionalliga">2003–04</a>, the club would once again sport a white shirt with brown sleeves, manufactured by Stanno. However this is, as of the 2022–23 season, the last time the club has donned its traditional kit. While the club's uniform for the 2005–06 season would combine a light shirt and brown shorts, St Pauli would wear an all-black kit during the following campaign (marking the first time that neither of the club's colours were present on the home kit). From the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%202.%20Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a>, St Pauli has worn an all-brown home kit on all but three occasions, one of which saw the team return to a striped shirt, while in the two other instances the team wore white shorts.
Between 2019–20 and 2021–22, <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> details were integrated into the third shirt. In 2020, having sought a kit supplier who would meet their ecological and ethical requirements since 2018, St Pauli founded their own brand, Di!Y ("Do it. Improve Yourself"). From the 2021–22 season, St Pauli have worn kits made in-house by Di!Y.

Supporters.
St Pauli enjoys a certain fame for the left-leaning character of its supporters: most of the team's fans regard themselves as <a href="anti-racist">anti-racist</a>, anti-fascist, <a href="Anti-homophobia">anti-homophobic</a> and <a href="anti-sexist">anti-sexist</a>, and this has, on occasion, brought them into conflict with <a href="Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazis</a> and hooligans at away games. The organization has adopted an outspoken stance against racism, fascism, sexism, and homophobia and has embodied this position in its constitution. Team supporters traditionally participate in demonstrations in the St Pauli district of Hamburg, including those over <a href="squatting">squatting</a> or low-income housing, such as the <a href="Hafenstra%C3%9Fe">Hafenstraße</a> and <a href="Bambule">Bambule</a>. The centre of fan activity is the "Fanladen St Pauli". St. Pauli has a supporters group in England, <a href="Yorkshire%20St.%20Pauli">Yorkshire St. Pauli</a>.
Partly because of shared leftist political views, St Pauli fans have strong relationships with supporters of <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> (Schickeria), <a href="Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>, <a href="Ternana%20Calcio">Ternana</a>, <a href="Unione%20Calcio%20Sampdoria">Unione Calcio Sampdoria</a>, <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a>, <a href="SV%20Babelsberg%2003">SV Babelsberg 03</a>, <a href="Hapoel%20Tel%20Aviv%20F.C.">Hapoel Tel Aviv</a>, <a href="AEK%20Athens%20F.C.">AEK Athens</a> (<a href="Original%2021">Original 21</a>), <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Olympique Marseille</a>, <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>, <a href="Venezia%20FC">Venezia</a>, <a href="Cosenza%20Calcio">Cosenza</a>, <a href="Standard%20L%C3%ADege">Standard Líege</a> and <a href="Clapton%20CFC">Clapton CFC</a> In the past they also had a friendship with the fans of <a href="Bohemians%201905">Bohemians 1905</a>, <a href="Partizan%20Minsk">Partizan Minsk</a> and <a href="F.C.%20United%20of%20Manchester">F.C. United of Manchester</a>, the latter of whom were invited to the Millerntor for a friendly game to celebrate St Pauli's centenary. The group "Ultrá Sankt Pauli" also has a special friendship with the group "Schickeria München", from the ultras scene of <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. A banner of the Schickeria München is occasionally displayed at the Millerntor Stadion, and a flag of the Ultrá Sankt Pauli – sporting a picture of <a href="Che%20Guevara">Che Guevara</a> – has been displayed at the <a href="Allianz%20Arena">Allianz Arena</a>. Both Ultrá Sankt Pauli and Schickeria München are members of "Alerta Network", an international anti-fascist network of supporter groups.
The club prides itself on having the largest number of female fans in all of German football. In 2002, advertisements for the men's magazine "<a href="Maxim%20%28magazine%29">Maxim</a>" were removed from the Millerntor-Stadion in response to fans' protests over the adverts' <a href="sexism">sexist</a> depictions of women. In 2011, the club banned <a href="lap%20dancing">lap dancers</a> from performing during match before guests at a corporate suite, following fans' complaints. The suite belonged to local lap dance club "Susies Show Bar".
St Pauli is also a worldwide symbol for <a href="punk%20rock">punk</a> and related subcultures. The skull and crossbones logo and the team's brown and white football jerseys have often been worn by international artists such as the bands <a href="Asian%20Dub%20Foundation">Asian Dub Foundation</a>, <a href="Gaslight%20Anthem">Gaslight Anthem</a> and <a href="Panteon%20Rococo">Panteon Rococo</a>. The <a href="KMFDM">KMFDM</a> frontman and Hamburg native <a href="Sascha%20Konietzko">Sascha Konietzko</a> is a recognisable St Pauli fan, at one point placing a huge picture of a fist smashing a <a href="swastika">swastika</a> on his band's main page, with the caption "St Pauli Fans gegen Rechts!" ("St Pauli fans against the <a href="Far-right%20politics">Right</a>") underneath it. American punk band <a href="Anti-Flag">Anti-Flag</a> can be seen wearing St Pauli shirts in numerous music videos for their album "<a href="American%20Fall">American Fall</a>". Another notable supporter and sponsor is <a href="Andrew%20Eldritch">Andrew Eldritch</a>, lead singer of band <a href="The%20Sisters%20of%20Mercy">The Sisters of Mercy</a>. On his 2006 "Sisters Bite The Silver Bullet"- tour, Eldritch wore the famous skull and crossbones shirt. <a href="Georg%20Holm">Georg Holm</a>, the bassist of the Icelandic <a href="post%20rock">post rock</a> band <a href="Sigur%20R%C3%B3s">Sigur Rós</a>, has performed at several festivals wearing a St Pauli T-shirt. <a href="Alex%20Rosamilia">Alex Rosamilia</a>, the guitarist for <a href="The%20Gaslight%20Anthem">The Gaslight Anthem</a>, frequently wears a St Pauli hat and hoodie and displays a flag of the club's logo in front of the speakers of his guitar amp. <a href="Editors%20%28band%29">Editors</a> guitarist and synthesiser player <a href="Chris%20Urbanowicz">Chris Urbanowicz</a> frequently wears the skull and crossbones t-shirt. Dave Doughman, the singer for <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>'s <a href="Swearing%20at%20Motorists">Swearing at Motorists</a>, who has been spotted in concert with the skull and crossbones on his guitar and amplifier, moved to St Pauli in 2010. <a href="Bad%20Religion">Bad Religion</a> played a charity match against St Pauli's third team in 2000. German musicians who are fans include: <a href="Fettes%20Brot">Fettes Brot</a>, <a href="Die%20%C3%84rzte">Die Ärzte</a> singer/drummer/songwriter <a href="Bela%20B.">Bela B.</a>, <a href="Kettcar">Kettcar</a>, <a href="Tomte%20%28band%29">Tomte</a>, and many other bands, most of them underground.
Several bands have also made music directly related to St Pauli: The Norwegian punk rock band <a href="Turbonegro">Turbonegro</a> recorded a special version of their song "<a href="I%20Got%20Erection">I Got Erection</a>" with re-worked German lyrics for St Pauli. In 2009, Italian ska combat-folk punk band <a href="Talco%20%28band%29">Talco</a> from <a href="Marghera">Marghera</a>, <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, wrote the song "St Pauli".

In 2010, FC St Pauli celebrated its 100th anniversary. For the occasion, the fan club 18auf12 recorded the song "Happy Birthday St Pauli, One Hundred Beers for You", with words and music by Henning Knorr and <a href="Christoph%20Br%C3%BCx">Christoph Brüx</a>.
The Canadian punk rock band The Pagans of Northumberland recorded a song in 2014 called simply "St Pauli" for their first 7-inch detailing their love of the club and its supporters around the world.

When the team played in Germany's 2nd Bundesliga, their home fixtures at the <a href="Millerntor-Stadion">Millerntor</a> used to average greater attendances than any other team and often exceeded turnouts for second division teams. As of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%202.%20Bundesliga">2011–12</a> season, St Pauli was the only team that has close to 100% in average home attendance.
In 2006, St Pauli had more season ticket holders than many Bundesliga teams. One study estimated that the team had roughly 11 million fans throughout Germany, making the club one of the most widely recognised German sides. The number of official fan clubs in 2011 passed 500, which was an increase of 300 over three years.
In January 2020, the club's famous skull and crossbones flag was listed by the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>'s counter-terrorism police in a guide sent to public sector workers, to notice potential <a href="extremism">extremism</a>, prompting a backlash from St Pauli's Welsh defender <a href="James%20Lawrence%20%28footballer%29">James Lawrence</a>.

The Low Dunk (featuring a smooth white colorway, and holding the team's logo impregnated in the side panel leather) was released only to shops in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, with only 150 pairs produced.
Fundamental Principles.
St Pauli were the first club in Germany to integrate a set of Fundamental Principles (Leitlinien) to dictate how the club is run. The Fundamental Principles were passed by an overwhelming majority at the St Pauli Congress in 2009 and they go beyond solely football.
The first five Principles states that:
– "In its totality, consisting of members, staff, fans and honorary officers, St Pauli FC is a part of the society by which it is surrounded and so is affected both directly and indirectly by social changes in the political, cultural and social spheres."
– "St Pauli FC is conscious of the social responsibility this implies, and represents the interests of its members, staff, fans and honorary officers in matters not just restricted to the sphere of sport."
– "St Pauli FC is the club of a particular city district, and it is to this that it owes its identity. This gives it a social and political responsibility in relation to the district and the people who live there."
– "St Pauli FC aims to put across a certain feeling for life and symbolises sporting authenticity. This makes it possible for people to identify with the club independently of any sporting successes it may achieve. Essential features of the club that encourage this sense of identification are to be honoured, promoted and preserved."
– "Tolerance and respect in mutual human relations are important pillars of the St Pauli philosophy.""
Stadium.
The home venue of the FC St Pauli is the <a href="Millerntor-Stadion">Millerntor-Stadion</a>. Work on the stadium began in 1961, but its completion was delayed until 1963 as there was initially no drainage system in place, making the pitch unplayable after rain. It originally held 32,000 supporters, but the capacity was later reduced for safety reasons.
In 1970, the stadium was renamed the Wilhelm Koch-Stadium in honour of a former club president. However, this name became highly controversial when it was discovered that Wilhelm Koch had been a member of the <a href="National%20Socialist%20German%20Workers%20Party">Nazi Party</a> during the war. After protests by fans, the name was changed back to Millerntor-Stadion in 1999.
A total redevelopment began in 2006. The final phase of the redevelopment work ended with the completion of the new north stand in July 2015. The stadium is since then permitted for a capacity of 29,546 spectators of which 16,940 are standing and 12,606 are seated.
The stadium is located next to the <a href="Heiligengeistfeld">Heiligengeistfeld</a>, and is overlooked by the infamous <a href="Flak%20tower%23Flakturm%20IV%20%E2%80%93%20Heiligengeistfeld%2C%20Hamburg">Flak Tower IV</a> to the north and a building of the <a href="Deutsche%20Telekom">Deutsche Telekom</a> to the south. It can easily be reached with the <a href="U-Bahn">Hamburg U-Bahn</a> line U3 (<a href="St.%20Pauli%20%28Hamburg%20U-Bahn%20station%29">St Pauli Station</a> and <a href="Feldstra%C3%9Fe%20%28Hamburg%20U-Bahn%20station%29">Feldstrasse Station</a>).

Other sports.
The St Pauli rugby section has several teams, both in the men's and women's leagues.

Alemannia Aachen

Alemannia Aachen () or ATSV Alemannia 1900 is a <a href="football%20in%20Germany">German football club</a> from the western city of <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>, North Rhine-Westphalia. A long term fixture of the country's <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">second division</a>, "Alemannia" enjoyed a three-year turn in the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> in the late 1960s and, after a successful 2005–06 campaign, returned to the first division for a <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Bundesliga">single season</a>. The club has since slipped to third division play and in late 2012 entered into bankruptcy. They finished their 2012–13 <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> schedule before resuming play in the tier IV <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a> in 2013–14.
Alemannia carries the nickname "the <a href="potato%20beetle">potato beetle</a>s" (Kartoffelkäfer) because of their striped yellow-black jerseys, which make them look like the particular insects.
History.
Foundation to World War II.
In the second half of the 19th century, resident English workers and businessmen brought football, in addition to the traditional equestrian sports, into the western <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>. The club was founded on 16 December 1900 by a group of eighteen high school students. Knowing that another team had already taken the name 1. FC Aachen, the new club was christened FC Alemannia, using the Latin word for Germany (see <a href="Alamannia">Alamannia</a>). The First World War devastated the club: the pre-war membership of 200 was reduced to a mere 37 by the conflict. In early 1919 Alemannia merged with local sports club Aachener Turnverein 1847 to become TSV Alemannia Aachen 1900. Their new partner's interest was primarily in gymnastics rather than football and as a result the union was short-lived, with the clubs splitting again in 1924.
The city of Aachen is very near the <a href="Belgium">Belgian</a> and <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> borders and as a result Alemannia has had frequent contact with clubs from those countries. Their first game was against the Belgian side <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Belgium">R. Dolhain F.C.</a>, one of that country's earliest clubs. There are intensive and friendly contacts with the Dutch professional club <a href="Roda%20JC%20Kerkrade">Roda JC Kerkrade</a>. Both clubs have the same club colors.
The team played in the Rhineland-Westphalia FA and won its first championship there in 1907, before joining the newly formed Westdeutsche Fussball Verband in 1909. The club grew steadily as interest in football increased. They qualified for the Rheingauliga in 1921, built their own stadium in 1928, and earned admittance to the Oberliga the following year.
The club enjoyed some success in the early 1930s by advancing to the final four of the Westdeutsche championship playoffs. In 1933, German football was re-organized under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> into sixteen top-flight <a href="Gauligen">Gauligen</a>. Alemannia played several seasons in the <a href="Gauliga%20Mittelrhein">Gauliga Mittelrhein</a> in the late 1930s and early 1940s. They finished top in their division in 1938 and advanced to the national final rounds. This was in spite of a protest by <a href="SV%20Beuel%2006">SV Beuel 06</a> which ultimately saw that club awarded the division championship, but too late to allow Beuel to play in the national playoff in Aachen's stead.
Alemannia is known as one of the few sports clubs of this era to offer any challenge to the <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> regime's purge of Jews from the country's sports organizations by demanding the release of a jailed Jewish member.
Postwar and entry to the Bundesliga.
In 1946, after World War II and the lifting of the ban placed by Allied occupation authorities on most types of organizations in Germany, "Alemannia" re-constituted itself and began play in second tier Rheinbezirk. They returned to first division play in the Oberliga West the next year, but ran into financial difficulty. They remained a steady, but unspectacular second division side, generally finishing mid-table.
"Aachen"'s first measure of success came with an advance to the <a href="DFB-Pokal">DFB-Pokal</a> final in 1953 where they lost a 1–2 decision to <a href="Rot-Weiss%20Essen">Rot-Weiss Essen</a>.
After the formation of the <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a>, Germany's new professional football league, in 1963, Alemannia found themselves in Regionalliga West (II). In 1965, they had another good run in German Cup competition, earning another final appearance – but were once again unsuccessful – this time losing 0–2 to <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>.
The club captured their division in 1967 and were promoted to the Bundesliga (I) for the 1967–68 season. They enjoyed their best ever result the next year with a second-place finish behind champion <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. However, the following season was a disaster: the team earned only one point in play away from home and toppled to an 18th-place finish. They returned to play in the Regionalliga West (II), and in 1990 fell still further to the third division.
Road to recovery.
After several mediocre seasons in the second half of the 1990s, trainer <a href="Werner%20Fuchs">Werner Fuchs</a> rejuvenated the Alemannia squad by playing 4–4–2 without a <a href="Libero%20%28football%29">libero</a> (sweeper), creating a side that played an attractive, fluid offense. In 1999, the team played well and delivered an especially strong second half. They were atop the table, just weeks away from the end of the season, when tragedy struck with the unexpected death of Fuchs. The whole city was in shock, but the club managed to pull through, dedicating their promotion to their late trainer and winning the <a href="Regionalliga%20West/S%C3%BCdwest">Regionalliga West/Südwest</a> (III). The first years in the <a href="2.%20Bundesliga">2. Bundesliga</a> were tough for Aachen, both on the field and financially. The club struggled for several seasons and the situation was worsened when financial irregularities were uncovered showing the club was near bankruptcy.
The turnaround came with a new executive board under president Horst Heinrichs, trainer <a href="Dieter%20Hecking">Dieter Hecking</a> and manager <a href="J%C3%B6rg%20Schmadtke">Jörg Schmadtke</a>. Through improved financial management, shrewd player signings, and clever game tactics, "Aachen" became a power once again in the 2003–04 season. They played their way to their third DFB-Pokal final appearance, knocking off <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">TSV 1860 Munich</a>, <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, and <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, before losing 2–3 to Bundesliga champions <a href="Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a>. As league champions Bremen already held a place in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, thereby making room for Aachen to take part in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> competition. They delivered a decent performance, advancing to the Round of 32 before going out to eventual semi-finalists <a href="AZ%20Alkmaar">AZ Alkmaar</a>. The club's participation in the German Cup and UEFA Cup play helped to significantly improve their financial situation.
Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga.
On 16 April 2006, Alemannia became the first team to earn promotion to the Bundesliga in 2005–06, ending Aachen's 36-year absence from top-flight football. However, they stayed up only a single season as they took only one point from their last eight matches of the campaign. In the middle of 2007, the club appointed former German international defender and 1990 FIFA World Champion <a href="Guido%20Buchwald">Guido Buchwald</a> as manager trainer, who was fired after only 14 matches. After a short interim with Alemannia's Sportsmanger Jörg Schmadtke as headcoach, he was then replaced by <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Seeberger">Jürgen Seeberger</a>, hardly known in Germany, in the winter break of the season.
The club suffered a rapid decline after its single Bundesliga season, being relegated from the 2. Bundesliga in 2012 and from the <a href="3.%20Liga">3. Liga</a> the season after. Alemannia consequently now plays in the tier four <a href="Regionalliga%20West">Regionalliga West</a>.

Stadium.
Alemannia Aachen used to play at the <a href="Old%20Tivoli">Old Tivoli</a> which had a capacity of 21,632 spectators (3,632 seats). One of Germany's better known stadiums, it was built in 1928 and was renovated several times. The club played its 2004 UEFA Cup matches, however, in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>'s <a href="RheinEnergieStadion">RheinEnergieStadion</a> in order to meet the stadium capacity requirements in place for the competition.
