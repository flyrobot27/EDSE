Real Sociedad

Real Sociedad de Fútbol, more commonly referred to as Real Sociedad (; "Royal Society") in English, Erreala or Reala in <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a>, La Real in Spanish, is a Spanish professional <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> in the city of <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">Donostia-San Sebastián</a>, <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a>, founded on 7 September 1909. It plays its home matches at the <a href="Anoeta%20Stadium">Anoeta Stadium</a>.
Real Sociedad won the Liga title in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20La%20Liga">1980–81</a> and <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20La%20Liga">1981–82</a>, and finished runner-up in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20La%20Liga">1979–80</a>, <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20La%20Liga">1987–88</a>, and <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20La%20Liga">2002–03</a>. The club has also won the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> three times, in <a href="1909%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1909</a>, <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1987</a>, and <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2020</a>. It contests the <a href="Basque%20derby">Basque derby</a> against rivals <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>. Real Sociedad was a founding member of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in 1929; its longest spell in the top flight was for 40 seasons, from 1967 to 2007.
Traditionally the club followed a policy (<a href="Athletic%20Bilbao%20signing%20policy">similar to that of its rival Athletic</a>) of signing only Basque players, before signing <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland</a> forward <a href="John%20Aldridge">John Aldridge</a> in 1989. While a strong Basque contingent has been retained among its players, nowadays both non-Basque Spaniards and foreign players are represented at the club. Its <a href="Real%20Sociedad%20cantera">youth section</a> subsequent to the all-Basque era has still been very successful in developing internationally renowned players, such as World Cup winners <a href="Xabi%20Alonso">Xabi Alonso</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Griezmann">Antoine Griezmann</a>.
The club has competed in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> four times. In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2013–14</a> season, the team finished 4th place in the group stage. In the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2003–04</a> season, the club progressed to the round of 16 before losing to <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a>. In the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20European%20Cup">1982–83 European Cup</a>, its predecessor tournament, the team reached the semifinals, only to lose narrowly against <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>. In the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20European%20Cup">1981–82</a>, the club lost in the first round against <a href="CSKA%20Sofia">CSKA Sofia</a>.
Aside from football (including a <a href="Real%20Sociedad%20Femenino">women's team</a>), Real Sociedad also has several sections in athletics, including <a href="track%20and%20field">track and field</a>, <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a>, and <a href="basque%20pelota">basque pelota</a>.
History.
Early history.
Football was introduced to <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a> in the early 1900s by students and workers returning from <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a>. In 1904, they formed <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Recreation%20Club">San Sebastián Recreation Club</a>, the first football club in the city, and in 1905 the club competed in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>. In 1907, a conflict between the club's members caused the team to split with several players (such as <a href="Alfonso%20Sena">Alfonso</a> and <a href="Miguel%20Sena">Miguel Sena</a> and Domingo Arrillaga) leaving to create a new team in 1908, the <a href="Club%20Ciclista%20de%20San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n%23Football%20section">San Sebastian Football Club</a>. This team applied to enter the <a href="1909%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1909 Copa del Rey</a>, but complications over registration permits saw them compete as Club Ciclista de San Sebastián. This team convincingly defeated the powerful <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Club</a> 4–2 in the quarter-finals and then beat <a href="Club%20Espa%C3%B1ol%20de%20Madrid">Club Español de Madrid</a> 3–1 in the <a href="1909%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">final</a>. A notable figure of this team was <a href="George%20McGuinness">George McGuinness</a>, who netted 6 goals in the tournament including the opener in the final.
A few months after this victory, the players who had won the tournament founded the Sociedad de Futbol on 7 September 1909. Sociedad applied to enter the <a href="1910%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1910 Copa del Rey</a>, but once again had to compete under a different name, Vasconia de San Sebastián, and once again they reached the <a href="1910%20UECF%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">final (UECF)</a>, where they were beaten by Athletic (0–1). In the same year, King <a href="Alfonso%20XIII">Alfonso XIII</a> – who used San Sebastián as his <a href="summer%20capital">summer capital</a> – gave the club his patronage, where it subsequently became known as Real Sociedad de Fútbol. The first final the club played as "Real Sociedad" was in <a href="1913%20UECF%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1913</a>, where <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> needed three games to beat them. After a 15-year hiatus, Sociedad reached the <a href="1928%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1928 final</a>, which was remarkably similar to their previous one since Barcelona again needed three games to beat them at <a href="Estadio%20El%20Sardinero%20%281913%29">El Sardinero</a>.
Real Sociedad was a founding member of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in 1929. The team came fourth with Francisco "Paco" Bienzobas finishing as the top scorer. The team's name was changed to "Donostia Club de Futbol" in 1931 with the advent of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>, but changed back to Real Sociedad after the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> in 1939. The team has generally fluctuated between the "Primera" and "Segunda" divisions, in one period (during the 1940s) managing to be relegated and promoted seven times. Around that time, the sculptor <a href="Eduardo%20Chillida">Eduardo Chillida</a> was the team's goalkeeper until injury put a stop to his football career.
The success of the 1980s.
The team finished as runners-up in La Liga for the first time in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20La%20Liga">1979–80</a>, gaining 52 points compared to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>'s 53, and 13 points clear of third-placed <a href="Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n">Sporting de Gijón</a>. Real Sociedad won its first ever Primera División title at the end of the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20La%20Liga">1980–81 season</a>, denying Real Madrid a fourth-consecutive title because although both clubs earned 45 points and Madrid had the superior goal difference Sociedad were better in the head-to-heads. This qualified La Real for the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20European%20Cup">1981–82 European Cup</a>, where they were eliminated in the first round by <a href="PFC%20CSKA%20Sofia">CSKA Sofia</a> of Bulgaria, who hosted and won the first leg 1–0. The second leg in Spain was a 0–0 draw.
The club retained the Liga title the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20La%20Liga">following season</a>, beating Barcelona by 47 points to 45, under the management of <a href="Alberto%20Ormaetxea">Alberto Ormaetxea</a>. Forward <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Satr%C3%BAstegui">Jesús María Satrústegui</a> was the club's top scorer for 1980–81 with 16 goals. He scored 13 the following season as <a href="Pedro%20Uralde">Pedro Uralde</a> was the top scorer, with 14. The club reached the semi-finals of the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20European%20Cup">1982–83 European Cup</a>, defeating <a href="Knattspyrnuf%C3%A9lagi%C3%B0%20V%C3%ADkingur">Víkingur</a> of Iceland, <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> and <a href="Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal">Sporting Clube de Portugal</a> before losing 3–2 on aggregate to eventual champions <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>. Real Sociedad won the <a href="Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a> at the beginning of the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20La%20Liga">1982–83 season</a>, overturning a 1–0 defeat in the first leg to defeat Real Madrid 4–1 on aggregate.
On 11 March 1987, Real Sociedad set a record for most goals in a quarter-final of the Copa del Rey after defeating <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">Mallorca</a> 10–1. In the semi-finals of the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Copa%20del%20Rey">same tournament</a>, it beat its <a href="Basque%20derby">Basque rivals</a> <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> 1–0 over two legs. On 27 June 1987, Real Sociedad won its first Copa del Rey title, defeating <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> 4–2 on penalties after drawing 2–2. The match was held at <a href="La%20Romareda">La Romareda</a> in <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>, <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a>. In the following season's Copa del Rey, Real Sociedad defeated Atlético Madrid again after defeating them in the quarter-finals. It then beat Real Madrid 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals, but lost 1–0 in the final to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> at Real Madrid's <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> on 30 March 1988. In the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20La%20Liga">1987–88 La Liga</a>, Real Sociedad were runners-up for the first time since its lost its title – with 51 points to Real Madrid's 62 – and three points clear of third-placed Atlético Madrid.
For many years, Real Sociedad followed the practice of its Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao of <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao%20signing%20policy">signing only Basque players</a>. It abandoned the policy in 1989 when it signed <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Irish international</a> <a href="John%20Aldridge">John Aldridge</a> from <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Aldridge scored 16 goals in his first season to be the club's top scorer, and fourth-highest scorer of the entire league as La Real finished fifth. In 1990, La Real signed an English striker, <a href="Dalian%20Atkinson">Dalian Atkinson</a> of <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, who therefore became the club's first black player. He scored 12 goals in his first season, second at the club only to Aldridge's 17. That was Aldridge's final season at La Real, and he left to play in the English 2nd tier at <a href="Tranmere%20Rovers">Tranmere Rovers</a>, while Atkinson left to join top-flight <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>.
In <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20La%20Liga">1997–98</a>, Real Sociedad finished third, its best finish since being runners-up for the first time since 1988. Its total of 63 points was 11 less than champions Barcelona but just two less than runners-up Athletic Bilbao. The club finished higher in the table than Real Madrid due to a superior goal differential. Yugoslav striker <a href="Darko%20Kova%C4%8Devi%C4%87">Darko Kovačević</a> scored 17 times that season, making him the fourth-highest scorer in the league. The third-place finish qualified La Real for the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Cup">1998–99 UEFA Cup</a>, where it beat <a href="AC%20Sparta%20Prague">Sparta Prague</a> and <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Moscow">Dynamo Moscow</a> before being knocked out in the third round by Atlético Madrid.
21st century.
After finishing in 13th position for three consecutive seasons, Real Sociedad were runners-up in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20La%20Liga">2002–03 La Liga</a>, its best finish since 1988. Its tally of 76 points was only beaten by Real Madrid's 78, and La Real had four more points than third-placed <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a>. The club was managed by Frenchman <a href="Raynald%20Denoueix">Raynald Denoueix</a>. La Real's strikeforce combined the Turkish striker <a href="Nihat%20Kahveci">Nihat Kahveci</a> with <a href="Serbia%20and%20Montenegro%20national%20football%20team">Yugoslav international</a> <a href="Darko%20Kova%C4%8Devi%C4%87">Darko Kovačević</a>. The two were third and fourth top scorer in the league respectively, with 23 and 20 goals. The team also included <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Dutch international</a> goalkeeper <a href="Sander%20Westerveld">Sander Westerveld</a> and <a href="Xabi%20Alonso">Xabi Alonso</a> in midfield. Alonso was the winner of the 2003 <a href="Don%20Bal%C3%B3n">Don Balón</a> award for the best Spanish player in the league, while Kahveci was voted the best foreign player and Denoueix the best manager.
Key moments from that season came when Real Sociedad beat Real Madrid in April 4–2 at the <a href="Anoeta%20Stadium">Anoeta Stadium</a>. It kept first place in La Liga until the penultimate game of 38, when it lost 3–2 away to <a href="Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a>, while Real Madrid beat Atlético Madrid 4–0. This meant that Real Madrid secured first place two points clear of Real Sociedad for the last game, where La Real defeated Atlético Madrid 3–0 and Real Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao to win the title. The team qualified directly for the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2003–04 UEFA Champions League</a> after finishing second; it was unbeaten at home, scored 71 goals in total and lost just six times.
Real Sociedad were placed in Group D of the 2003–04 Champions League with <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, <a href="Galatasaray%20S.K.%20%28football%29">Galatasaray</a> and <a href="Olympiacos%20F.C.">Olympiacos</a>. The team won two matches, drew three and lost away to Juventus to finish second and advance to the last 16. It was knocked out after losing 1–0 in both games against <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a>, hosting the first game. The <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20La%20Liga">2003–04 La Liga</a> saw a dramatic decline in the club's performance, slipping to 15th out of 20. Their tally of 46 points was only five more than relegated <a href="Real%20Valladolid">Real Valladolid</a>.
On 9 September 2006, Real Sociedad played its 2,000th La Liga match. That same season, they were relegated from La Liga, finishing 19th and ended a 40-year streak there, their longest ever stay in the top flight. On 9 July 2007, former Welsh international and <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> manager <a href="Chris%20Coleman%20%28footballer%29">Chris Coleman</a> was appointed as the new club coach, on the recommendation of former Real Sociedad manager <a href="John%20Toshack">John Toshack</a>, an important board member at the club. Coleman resigned on 16 January 2008.
In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20La%20Liga">2012–13 season</a>, Real Sociedad finished in fourth place and qualified for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2013–14 Champions League</a> for the first time since the 2003–04 season, but in the play-offs, this time. In the play-offs, the club defeated Lyon 2–0 in both legs to qualify for the group stage. Real Sociedad, however, did not make it out of the group, earning just one point.
On 10 November 2014, Real Sociedad announced <a href="David%20Moyes">David Moyes</a> as the chosen manager to replace <a href="Jagoba%20Arrasate">Jagoba Arrasate</a>, who was sacked following a series of poor results. Moyes became the sixth British manager in the club's history, however he was sacked 9 November 2015 after falling to 16th in La Liga. Later that day, he was replaced by <a href="Eusebio%20Sacrist%C3%A1n">Eusebio Sacristán</a>.
Sacristán signed an initial contract until 30 June 2017. His contract was renewed in 2017, but Sacristán was ultimately dismissed after a string of poor performances left that 15th in the table and drawn into a relegation battle. <a href="Asier%20Garitano">Aiser Garitano</a> became the next head coach, having arrived from <a href="CD%20Legan%C3%A9s">Leganés</a>. He lasted only seven months before being dismissed, with the team also in 15th place, with only five wins in his seventeen league matches.
Garitano was succeeded by reserve team manager and local boy <a href="Imanol%20Alguacil">Imanol Alguacil</a> on 26 December 2018. During his tenure, he oversaw an attacking style of play combining pace, precision, power, and exuberance.
In 2008, at Real Sociedad's annual general meeting, Iñaki Badiola, at the time the club's president, accused the preceding club management of buying doping substances. In 2013 Badiola gave an extended interview were he accused <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Astiazar%C3%A1n">José Luis Astiazarán</a>'s presidency of paying up to €300,000 to <a href="Eufemiano%20Fuentes">Eufemiano Fuentes</a> to dope players on the team between 2001 and 2007. <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Astiazar%C3%A1n">José Luis Astiazarán</a>, who was Real Sociedad's president between 2001 and 2005, denied the claims.
Real Sociedad won its third Copa del Rey on 3 April 2021, the nearly year-long delayed <a href="2020%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2020 Copa del Rey Final</a> due to COVID-19, in a <a href="Basque%20derby">Basque derby</a> against Athletic Bilbao. In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20La%20Liga">2022–23</a> season, the club finished fourth in La Liga to qualify to the next season's <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> for the first time in ten years.
Stadium and facility.
Real Sociedad plays home fixtures in the Anoeta Stadium. The venue is owned by the <a href="City%20Council%20of%20San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián Municipal Council</a>.
Name and colours.
The club's name means "Royal Society of Football" in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>. The club's name was changed to "Donostia Club de Futbol" in 1931 with the advent of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>, but changed back to Real Sociedad after the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> in 1939. The club is nicknamed in <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a> as Erreala or the txuri-urdin ("white-blue" due to the colours of their kit). The colours stem from the flag of San Sebastián: a blue canton on a white field.
Fanbase.
The Spanish Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (Centre of Sociological Investigations) found out that of 2,473 adults interviewed in 49 provinces in 2007, 1.3% of the Spanish population have more feelings for Real Sociedad than any other club, and 1.5% have more feelings for La Real than any other club apart from their favourite.
In appreciation of the value of the supporters to the club – in the words of club president Jokin Aperribay, "The fans are the soul, the nourishment and the reason for Real Sociedad" – the players each wore the name of a randomly selected club member on their shirt for the match against <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> in December 2012.

History.
Club Deportivo Tenerife was founded in 1922. <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> started in 1928, but the team played in regional divisions until it was promoted to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> in 1953. It first reached the top flight in 1961, <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20La%20Liga">being immediately relegated back</a> and, in the following 27 years, played almost exclusively in the second level, also spending three years in <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> and six – five in a row – in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>, the newly created division three (in 1978).
In 1985, when Tenerife were relegated to the third division for a second time, Javier Pérez became president of the club. The side was promoted this year to the second level and, <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">two years later</a>, returned to the first, after winning the promotion playoff against <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> (4–1 on aggregate).
In 1991, <a href="Jorge%20Valdano">Jorge Valdano</a> took charge of the club as manager, and the Argentine would help rob former side <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> of two consecutive league titles in the last round, to the benefit of <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. In <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20La%20Liga">the first season</a>, the Canary Islands outfit barely avoided relegation, but would <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20La%20Liga">finish in a best-ever fifth position in the following year</a>, eventually reaching the <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament">round of 16</a> in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20UEFA%20Cup">the subsequent</a> <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, losing to <a href="Juventus%20FC">Juventus</a> 2–4 on aggregate.
German <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> became head coach of Tenerife in 1995, <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20La%20Liga">leading the club to another fifth-placed finish</a> and the quarter-finals of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>. In the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20UEFA%20Cup">1996–97 UEFA Cup</a>, the islanders fared better, reaching the last-four after defeating <a href="Maccabi%20Tel%20Aviv%20F.C.">Maccabi Tel Aviv</a>, <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a>, <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> and <a href="Br%C3%B8ndby%20IF">Brøndby</a> (the winner coming late in <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a> from an <a href="Antonio%20Mata">Antonio Mata</a> <a href="Direct%20free%20kick">free-kick</a>), only bowing out to eventual winners <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>.
Tenerife then went on a downward spiral which eventually led to relegation to the "silver category" in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20La%20Liga">1999</a>, prompting various managerial changes within the club. In <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2001</a>, the club was again promoted, led by <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a>, who promptly left to take up the manager's job at <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>; the promotion was achieved in the last match of the campaign thanks to a goal from <a href="Hugo%20Morales">Hugo Morales</a>.
<a href="Pepe%20Mel">Pepe Mel</a> became the new trainer but the first division season never took off, as Tenerife were beaten heavily at home by Barcelona 0–6, which cost the manager his job. <a href="Javier%20Clemente">Javier Clemente</a>, formerly with the <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain national team</a>, took the reins, but could not help prevent <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20La%20Liga">the eventual immediate relegation</a>.
Tenerife suffered from serious economic problems in the following years, owing more than €40 million. President Pérez was replaced with <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Perez%20de%20Ascanio">Víctor Perez de Ascanio</a>, who resigned due to bad management, leaving his position to <a href="Miguel%20Concepci%C3%B3n">Miguel Concepción</a>, who negotiated with local politicians and businessmen, also creating a construction company as a subsidiary of the side.
On 13 June 2009, Tenerife <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">secured a top flight return</a> after a seven-year absence after a 1–0 win at <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona</a>. In <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20La%20Liga">the following season</a>, even though the team held on until the last round, another relegation befell, after the 0–1 loss at third-placed Valencia.
<a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2010–11</a> brought with it three coaching changes, as Tenerife eventually suffered another relegation, returning to the third division after 24 years. On 2 June 2013, the club, led by <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Cervera">Álvaro Cervera</a>, returned to the second level after <a href="2013%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">winning the promotion play-off</a> against <a href="CE%20L%27Hospitalet">Hospitalet</a> (3–2 on aggregate).
Fans.
Fans of Tenerife are called "Chicharreros" because in early days, the inhabitants of a small fishing village called <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife">Santa Cruz</a> (later the capital of Tenerife) consumed "chicharros" (<a href="Atlantic%20horse%20mackerel">Atlantic horse mackerel</a>) as a main part of their diet.
Other inhabitants of Tenerife and the Canary Islands used the moniker as a pejorative name, but finally the inhabitants of Santa Cruz accepted it affectionately.

History.
Officially founded in 1919 as "Levante Foot-ball Club"
(records show earlier denominations, such as 1903's "Foot Ball Club de Murcia" and 1906's "Murcia Football Club"), Real Murcia was named as such, in 1923–24, by <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">King Alfonso XIII</a>. The following year, the <a href="Estadio%20de%20La%20Condomina">La Condomina</a> stadium was opened, with the club holding home games there for the next 82 years uninterrupted.
In 1929 the club first competed in the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> (third tier), achieving its first ever promotion to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in 1939–40. The highest position of 11th was reached in 1945, 1946, 1984 and 1987.
Murcia holds the record for the most <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> titles with eight, most recently in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2002–03</a> under manager <a href="David%20Vidal">David Vidal</a>. In that season, the team also equalled its best run in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> by reaching the quarter-finals before losing on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a> to <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a>, despite a 4–3 win in the second leg at home.
Following an immediate descent back to Segunda in last place, the team won promotion to the top flight for the last time under <a href="Lucas%20Alcaraz">Lucas Alcaraz</a> in 2007, again lasting only one year. In June 2010, the team fell into <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> for the first time in a decade with a 1–1 draw at <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona FC</a> on the final day, with goalkeeper <a href="Alberto%20Cifuentes">Alberto Cifuentes</a> saving a <a href="penalty%20kick">penalty kick</a> from <a href="Kiko%20Rat%C3%B3n">Kiko Ratón</a> in added time before it deflected in off himself.
Murcia returned immediately to the second tier, winning the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2010–11 Segunda División B</a> title with a <a href="penalty%20shootout">penalty shootout</a> win over <a href="CE%20Sabadell%20FC">CE Sabadell FC</a> in June after a 1–1 aggregate draw. In 2014, the team finished fourth and was top seeded for the playoffs, losing 2–1 on aggregate to eventual winners <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%20CF">Córdoba CF</a>; weeks later Murcia were relegated for non-compliance with <a href="Liga%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Profesional">Liga de Fútbol Profesional</a> regulations.
In <a href="2019%20Copa%20Federaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">2019</a>, Murcia won the <a href="Spanish%20Royal%20Federation%20Cup">Spanish Royal Federation Cup</a> for the first time with a penalty shootout victory over <a href="CD%20Tudelano">CD Tudelano</a>.

Deportivo de La Coruña

Real Club Deportivo de La Coruña (), commonly known as Deportivo La Coruña (), Deportivo or simply Dépor, is a <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in the city of <a href="A%20Coru%C3%B1a">A Coruña</a>, <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a>, Spain. As of the 2023–24 season, they play in the <a href="Primera%20Federaci%C3%B3n">Primera Federación</a> – Group 1, the third tier of the <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">football league pyramid</a> in Spain.
Founded in 1906 as "Club Deportivo de la Sala Calvet" by Federico Fernández-Amor Calvet, Deportivo have won the <a href="La%20Liga">league</a> title once, in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20La%20Liga">1999–2000 season</a>, and finished as runner-up on five occasions. The club have also won the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Spanish Cup</a> twice (<a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1994–95</a> and <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2001–02</a>), three <a href="Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Spanish Super Cups</a> (1995, 2000 and 2002), and the now defunct <a href="Concurso%20Espa%C3%B1a">Concurso España</a> (1912). The "Blue and Whites" were a regular fixture in the top positions of La Liga for the best part of 20 years, from 1991 to 2010, finishing in the top half of the table in 16 out of 19 seasons, and are ranked 12th in the all-time La Liga table. As a result, the club was a regular participant in European competitions, playing in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for five consecutive seasons between 2000–01 and 2004–05, reaching the quarter-finals twice and reaching the semi-finals in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2003–04</a> season.
Deportivo have played their home games at the 32,490-capacity <a href="Estadio%20Riazor">Riazor</a> since 1944, when the stadium was built. Their traditional home kit consists of blue and white striped shirts with blue shorts and socks. The club has a long-standing rivalry with <a href="Celta%20Vigo">Celta Vigo</a>, and matches between the two sides are known as the <a href="Galician%20derby">Galician derby</a>.
History.
Foundation and first steps.
Unlike what happened in most of the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, football did not reach the city of <a href="A%20Coru%C3%B1a">A Coruña</a> through the English, instead, it was introduced by José María Abalo, a youngster who had returned to his hometown after studying in England. The game gained rapid popularity and several teams were formed on an informal basis.
In December 1906, members of Sala Calvet gymnasium formed Deportivo de La Coruña, naming Luis Cornide as the first president. In May 1907, <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XIII of Spain</a> granted the club the "Real" ("royal") denomination. Dépor started playing at Corral de la Gaiteira ("Piper's Yard"), but soon moved to <a href="Estadio%20Riazor%23History">Old Riazor</a>, a new ground near the Riazor beach.
The team played <a href="Exhibition%20game%23Associaiton%20football">friendly matches</a> regularly and competed in local leagues, but failed to achieve success in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> in its early years. However, in 1912 Deportivo won their first official title, the short-lived <a href="Concurso%20Espa%C3%B1a">Concurso España</a>. 
In 1920, the <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spanish national team</a> made its debut at the <a href="1920%20Summer%20Olympics">Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>. A good run for Spain increased the popularity of football, and as a result, many teams gained professional status, and a league competition was established and scheduled for the <a href="1929%20La%20Liga">1928–29 season</a>.
1928–1947: Segunda División and the top flight.
In 1928, Dépor failed to qualify for the first ever <a href="La%20Liga">Primera División</a>, instead competing in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, where it finished eighth out of ten. The team kept battling over the next few years in a division that was soon to undergo many structural and geographical changes. In 1932, in the Cup, Dépor defeated <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>, which had gone unbeaten through the entire season in the league.
In 1936, the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> broke out, forcing the abandonment of all official competitions until the <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20La%20Liga">1939–40 season</a>. That year, "The Herculeans" qualified for the promotion stage. The final game was against archrivals <a href="Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a>, who were fighting to avoid relegation. Celta won 1–0 and remained in the top flight as Depor's hopes of promotion were denied. The following season, however, the club reached the promotion play-offs again, this time beating <a href="Real%20Murcia">Murcia</a> 2–1 to earn promotion to La Liga for the first time in the team's history.
The <a href="1941%E2%80%9342%20La%20Liga">first season</a> in the top flight saw the club finish fourth. However, the club declined in the next few seasons, finishing ninth, 12th and, in <a href="1944%E2%80%9345%20La%20Liga">1944–45</a>, 14th, resulting in relegation. Instant promotion was achieved the following year, but Dépor were relegated again at the end of the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20La%20Liga">1946–47 season</a>. Nonetheless, the team gained instant promotion in <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20La%20Liga">1947–48</a>.
This decade saw Depor's entrance to the top flight, so the club decided to build a new ground, <a href="Estadio%20Riazor">Riazor</a>, which remains their home today. It was opened on 28 October 1944 with a league game against <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>. In this era, the key player of the team was <a href="Juan%20Acu%C3%B1a">Juan Acuña</a>, the club's goalkeeper. "Xanetas", as he was known by locals, earned four <a href="Ricardo%20Zamora%20Trophy">Zamora Trophies</a> between 1942 and 1951, making him the second-most decorated keeper in the Spanish league.
1948–1957: the "Golden Decade".
The club ended the <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20La%20Liga">1948–49 season</a> in tenth place. The next season would see their first major achievement in the league; Dépor finished as runners-up, just one point behind <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> under the management of Argentinian <a href="Alejandro%20Scopelli">Alejandro Scopelli</a>, who brought to the club a group of South American players such as Julio Corcuera, Oswaldo García, Rafael Franco and <a href="Dagoberto%20Moll">Dagoberto Moll</a>, a group that made the team more competitive and able to remain top flight status for nine consecutive seasons until <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20La%20Liga">1957</a>. It was a great period for the club, as honoured managers like <a href="Helenio%20Herrera">Helenio Herrera</a> and players as <a href="Pahi%C3%B1o">Pahiño</a> and local <a href="Luis%20Su%C3%A1rez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201935%29">Luis Suárez</a> (the only Spanish player to receive the <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or%20%281956%E2%80%932009%29">Golden Ball</a> honour) played at the Riazor.
1958–1973: "Elevator Team".
After nine seasons of first-tier football in Spain, the team was relegated to the Segunda División in 1957 and stayed there for five seasons until 1962, when they were promoted into the top flight. This started a yo-yo era that led the club to be known as the "elevator team"; promotions were achieved in 1962, 1964, 1966, 1968 and 1971, yet subsequent relegations occurred during 1963, 1965, 1967, 1970 and 1973.
Dépor had one of the best youth systems at the time in Spain, as youngsters including <a href="Amancio%20Amaro">Amancio Amaro</a>, <a href="Severino%20Reija">Severino Reija</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Veloso">José Luis Veloso</a> and <a href="Jaime%20Blanco%20Garc%C3%ADa">Jaime Blanco</a> began their careers at the Riazor, in the future to become regular fixtures on the Spanish national team. Still more, including Luis Suárez, went on to play for larger clubs in Spain and Europe. However, the difficult financial situation of the club led to the forced sales of these players, and the team could not consolidate themselves in the top flight. This "yo-yo era" ended with relegation from the Primera División in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20La%20Liga">1973</a>.
1974–1988: dark times.
After being relegated in 1973, the team struggled in the Second Division, failing to avoid another relegation and falling to the third tier (<a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>) for the first time in their history. However, Dépor gained instant promotion and established themselves in the second tier for the rest of the decade. In <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1980</a>, Dépor were again relegated to the newly created <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>, the third tier, again for the second time in their history. Again, however, the drop was short-lived as the team gained promotion the following season. Notably, Dépor were relegated and promoted along with arch-rivals Celta de Vigo, who played during the 1980–81 season the most attended games ever in Spain's third tier.
The club continued to play in the Second Division, showing little chance of being promoted back to the top flight. In the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1987–88</a> season, Dépor struggled and only avoided relegation after Vicente Celeiro scored a goal during added time against <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Racing Santander</a> in the last game of the season. This is often regarded as the end of the club's dark times and the beginning of a new era.
During this period, the club was heavily affected by financial difficulties and internal troubles with managers being sacked almost every year. In the summer of 1988, an open and popular club assembly chose a new board of directors headed by Augusto César Lendoiro. Deportivo had a debt estimated at 600 million <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a>, had been out of the top flight for 15 years and lacked established structures at economic and sporting level.
1989–1998: resurgence and "Súper Dépor".
<a href="Arsenio%20Iglesias">Arsenio Iglesias</a>, a former Deportivo player and manager, was again appointed as manager in the 1988–89 season. Dépor had a lengthy run in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, though ultimately falling in the semi-finals to <a href="Real%20Valladolid">Real Valladolid</a>. The next year, the team competed well in the league and qualified for the promotion play-offs, but expectations were denied again, this time by <a href="CD%20Tenerife">Tenerife</a>. The <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1990–91</a> season saw Dépor finishing as runners-up, finally achieving promotion to La Liga after an 18-year absence. Additionally, the club's finances began to improve and social support increased, especially amongst youth groups.
The <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">1991–92 season</a>, the team's first back in the top flight, saw Dépor struggle, and they were forced to take part in the relegation play-off, beating <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> in a two-legged round. In 1992, Arsenio Iglesias began his fourth spell as Dépor manager; experienced players were also added to the team during that period, including <a href="Luis%20L%C3%B3pez%20Rekarte">López Rekarte</a>, <a href="Paco%20Lia%C3%B1o">Paco Liaño</a>, <a href="Claudio%20Barrag%C3%A1n">Claudio Barragán</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Ribera">José Luis Ribera</a>, <a href="Adolfo%20Aldana">Adolfo Aldana</a> and <a href="Donato%20%28footballer%29">Donato</a>, along with promising youngsters such as local player <a href="Fran%20%28Spanish%20footballer%29">Fran</a> and Brazilians <a href="Bebeto">Bebeto</a> and <a href="Mauro%20Silva">Mauro Silva</a>.
The <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">1992–93</a> Deportivo squad experienced a resurgent season, placing in top positions all season and ultimately finishing third after champions <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and runners-up Real Madrid, respectively, thus qualifying for European competition for the first time in their history. That year, the club also provided La Liga's <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">Pichichi Trophy</a> winner, Bebeto, and its Zamora Trophy winner, Paco Liaño. Additionally, Dépor made a historic comeback against Real Madrid at Riazor, trailing 2–0 at half-time but winning the game 3–2 and starting a run of 18 seasons to "Los Blancos" without a win at A Coruña.
In <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">1993–94</a>, Dépor had another fantastic season, leading the table for the majority of the year and coming to the last matchday in first to face mid-table Valencia, knowing a win would ensure the first league title in club history. The game was very close, but near its end, Valencia's Serer conceded a penalty on <a href="Fernando%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Perales">Nando</a>. Regular penalty-taker Donato had been substituted, so Serbian defender <a href="Miroslav%20%C4%90uki%C4%87">Miroslav Đukić</a> took it, but Valencia keeper González caught the ball; Deportivo saw their possible league title denied. After the frustration passed, the fans nonetheless recognised the impressive season the club had: Paco Liaño earned his second Zamora Trophy after conceding just 18 goals in 38 games, and Dépor made its debut in European competitions with the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, beating <a href="AaB%20Fodbold">Aalborg</a> and <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> but losing to <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in the round of 16.
The <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">1994–95 season</a> began with manager Arsenio Iglesias stating he would leave the club after the end of the year, though Dépor made another great campaign finishing again as runners-up, this time to Real Madrid. In that season's <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, Deportivo were beaten again in the round of 16 by a German club, this time by <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> 3–2 on aggregate. Depor had won the first leg at home 1–0, and Dortmund equalized in the second leg to send the match into extra time. Now in extra time, Depor scored a second goal to put the match at 2–1, but with five minutes remaining, Dortmund scored two goals in two minutes to win the series. Despite this tough defeat, the season still hid a great surprise for the club, as Dépor made a fantastic run in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> and reached <a href="1995%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">the final</a> for the first time in club history, against Valencia. On 24 June 1995, at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu</a>, the final was levelled 1–1 when referee García-Aranda suspended the game at the 80th minute due to heavy rain and a hailstorm. It was decided that the game would resume three days later. Two minutes after the match resumed, <a href="Alfredo%20Santaelena">Alfredo Santaelena</a> scored a header, which proved to be the winning goal that handed Depor their first major title (notwithstanding the 1912 <a href="Concurso%20Espa%C3%B1a">Concurso España</a>).
The <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">1995–96</a> season was an average one for Depor; they finished ninth in the league table, but reached the semi-finals of the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a>, losing to eventual champions <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">PSG</a>. The <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">1997–98</a> season was very disappointing. The team only finished twelfth in the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20La%20Liga">league table</a>, failing to qualify for European competitions, and were eliminated in the first round of the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> by French club <a href="AJ%20Auxerre">Auxerre</a>.
1999–2007: La Liga title, "El Centenariazo", and European Glory days.
In <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20La%20Liga">1999–2000</a>, Deportivo, managed by <a href="Javier%20Irureta">Javier Irureta</a> and with players like <a href="Noureddine%20Naybet">Noureddine Naybet</a>, <a href="Diego%20Trist%C3%A1n">Diego Tristán</a>, <a href="Djalminha">Djalminha</a>, <a href="Fran%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201969%29">Fran</a>, <a href="Roy%20Makaay">Roy Makaay</a> and <a href="Mauro%20Silva">Mauro Silva</a>, finally won their first La Liga title, five points ahead of Barcelona and Valencia. With this title, La Coruña became the second-smallest Spanish city with a population of approximately 250,000, behind <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a> (home of <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>), to have ever won La Liga.
As league champions, Deportivo qualified for the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the first time in its history. Their first match was a 1–1 draw against <a href="Panathinaikos%20F.C.">Panathinaikos</a> in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. They went on to top their group unbeaten with two wins and four draws. In the second group stage, they also topped their group, and Deportivo were now looking to be one of the strongest teams in the competition. However, in the quarter finals, they lost the first leg 3–0 to Leeds United, and although Depor won the second leg at Riazor 2–0, it was not enough and they were eliminated. The <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">following campaign</a>, they were unbeaten in the first group stage again, including two wins against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. They progressed out of the second group stage into the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by the team they beat twice in the group stage, Manchester United. On 8 September 2001, Deportivo played its 1,000th game in La Liga.
In the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">2001–02 season</a>, Depor finished league runner-up to Valencia and won the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> for a second time with a 2–1 win against Real Madrid on 6 March 2002. This match is commonly known in Spain as the "<a href="Centenariazo">Centenariazo</a>". Deportivo's opponents were expected to win the final comfortably as they were nicknamed the "<a href="Gal%C3%A1cticos">Galácticos</a>" and were among the strongest teams in Europe at the time. Additionally, the final was being played at their home ground, the Santiago Bernabéu. Everything was prepared so that after the expected victory, Real Madrid could celebrate their 100th anniversary by lifting the trophy in front of their own fans. However, Deportivo spoiled the party with a 2–1 win with goals from <a href="Sergio%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201976%29">Sergio</a> and Tristán.
Depor's best Champions League campaign was in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2003–04 season</a>, where they lost to eventual winners <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a> by a narrow 1–0 aggregate scoreline in the semi-finals. Although this was their best Champions League campaign, the club also had its biggest defeat in European competitions, losing 8–3 to <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a> in the group stage. However, this campaign is also remembered for their stunning comeback against <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> in the quarter-finals. Milan won the first leg 4–1 at <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a>, but in the second leg at Riazor, Deportivo won 4–0 and eliminated the defending champions 5–4 on aggregate.
Deportivo had a mediocre <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">2004–05 season</a>. The team finished eighth in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, only good enough to qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a>. In the Champions League, the club had their worst campaign ever, finishing bottom of their group without winning a single match, and without scoring a single goal. This season ended the club's spell of five consecutive years playing Champions League football.
In the summer of 2005, manager <a href="Javier%20Irureta">Javier Irureta</a> was replaced by <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Caparr%C3%B3s">Joaquín Caparrós</a>, ending his seven-year spell at the club.
2008–2014: transition and decline.
Deportivo's period in the top flight came to an end as they were relegated after finishing 18th in <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20La%20Liga">2010–11</a>. In July 2015, however, it was suspected that in the final round of matches for that season, <a href="UD%20Levante">Levante</a> and <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a> were involved in a match-fixing scandal which ensured that the latter won 2–1 at the <a href="Estadi%20Ciutat%20de%20Val%C3%A8ncia">Estadi Ciutat de València</a> and remained in the division at the expense of Deportivo, who lost 2–0 at home to Valencia. The case was in Courts until December 2020, when the match fixing was discarded by the <a href="Audiencias%20Provinciales%20of%20Spain">Provincial Court</a>.
In the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2011–12 season</a>, Deportivo made an immediate return to the top flight, spending half of the season top of the league. <a href="Lassad%20Nouioui">Lassad Nouioui</a> was the top scorer with 14 goals, <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Guardado">Andrés Guardado</a> the top assistant and <a href="%C3%81lex%20Berganti%C3%B1os">Álex Bergantiños</a> the only player to participate in all league matches. They amassed a Segunda División record haul of 91 points and finished in first position.
In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20La%20Liga">2012–13 season</a>, Deportivo finished 19th after a turbulent campaign under three managers, and once again were relegated to the Segunda División. Deportivo, however, finished second in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2013–14 season</a>, guaranteeing promotion to the top-flight for the second time in three years. A less-than-impressive <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20La%20Liga">2014–15 campaign</a> back in the top division with a disjointed squad featured some very poor performances on the pitch under new manager <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Víctor Fernández</a>, including a humiliating 2–8 reverse at home to Real Madrid. This was especially disappointing considering the impressive 18-match unbeaten home run between 1992–93 and 2010–11 at the Riazor against Madrid, a feat which no other team has managed to achieve in the history of Spanish football. Deportivo ultimately finished the season in 16th place and avoided relegation after appointing former player <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20S%C3%A1nchez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201976%29">Víctor Sánchez</a> as manager on 9 April 2015, for the remaining eight matches of the season.
2015–present: "New Dépor" and relegation to the third division.
With Víctor Sánchez as their new manager, Deportivo made changes for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">new season</a>. With the addition of new players <a href="Alejandro%20Arribas">Alejandro Arribas</a>, <a href="Fernando%20Navarro%20%28Spanish%20footballer%29">Fernando Navarro</a>, <a href="Pedro%20Mosquera">Pedro Mosquera</a> and <a href="Fay%C3%A7al%20Fajr">Fayçal Fajr</a>, Deportivo began the season with a 0–0 draw against Real Sociedad. On 28 November 2015, with a 2–0 victory against <a href="UD%20Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a>, Deportivo were in fifth place after an impressive start. However, after a disastrous second half of the season, which was precipitated by a 3–0 home defeat to <a href="CD%20Mirand%C3%A9s">Mirandés</a> in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, Deportivo won only two matches out of the next 22, including an 8–0 humiliation at the hands of Barcelona, and only secured their safety in La Liga in the penultimate game of the season with a victory over <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a>. Victor Sánchez was sacked on 29 May 2016 after several incidents of player unrest within the squad.
The team continued in a negative spiral in the following seasons. At the end of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Deportivo%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a%20season">2017–18 season</a>, Deportivo was relegated following a 4–2 home defeat to Barcelona, which also secured Barcelona the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> title. The following season, the club played in Segunda División and finished sixth. In the promotion play-offs, Deportivo lost to <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">Mallorca</a> 3–2 on aggregate and remained in Segunda División. In the following campaign Deportivo was relegated once again, falling down into <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> for the first time in 39 years. In 2020–21, the league system in Spain was reorganized and Deportivo was almost relegated to the newly-formed fourth division, <a href="Segunda%20Federaci%C3%B3n">Segunda Federación</a>, escaping relegation by just one point. Thus, they remained in the third division, in the newly-formed <a href="Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">Primera División RFEF</a>, for the 2021–22 season.
Identity.
Crest.
Deportivo's crest contains cues to predecessor Sala Calvet's crest, with a gentlemen's belt encircling the purple and white banner of the gymnasium. The banner itself features a sky blue diagonal band which represents the maritime flag of A Coruña and the <a href="Galician%20flag">Galician flag</a>. In addition, it features a crown which represents its royal patronage (granted in 1909 by <a href="Alfonso%20XIII">Alfonso XIII</a>). During the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Spanish Republic</a>, the honorific "real" (royal) and the crown were removed from the club crest; this was to return under Francoist Spain.
Kit.
Deportivo have always played in their famous blue and white stripes, but it was not until 1912 that the club made these colours official for matches. Deportivo continues to wear blue and white striped shirts with blue shorts and socks, yet their second and third kits change annually according to commercial interests. Their current shirt sponsors are local brewery <a href="Hijos%20de%20Rivera%20Brewery">Hijos de Rivera</a>, with <a href="Kappa%20%28brand%29">Kappa</a> manufacturing the kits. In 2015, Deportivo and <a href="Estrella%20Galicia">Estrella Galicia</a> extended their sponsorship deal throughout the 2015–16 La Liga season with an option of a further year.
Supporters.
Deportivo's supporters are known as "deportivistas." Despite playing in the third tier, the club had 25,001 season ticket holders in the 2022–23 season. The supporters organise themselves around 200 supporter groups known as "peñas"; the most well-known being the "Riazor Blues". The interests of the supporters are represented by the Federación de Peñas RC Deportivo.

Elche CF

Elche Club de Fútbol, S.A.D. () is a Spanish professional <a href="association%20football%20club">football</a> club based in <a href="Elche">Elche</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20Alicante">Province of Alicante</a>, in the <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencian Community</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. Founded in 1923, the club competes in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">LaLiga Hypermotion</a>, holding home matches at "<a href="Estadio%20Manuel%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Valero">Estadio Manuel Martínez Valero</a>", with a capacity of 33,732 seats.
Founded in 1923 as the result of a merger between all of the town's clubs, Elche entered the league system in 1929, reaching <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> in <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1934</a> and <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1959</a>, finishing fifth in the latter tournament in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20La%20Liga">1963–64</a>. The club were runners-up in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> in <a href="1969%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo">1969</a>. Elche became the first and only club in the history of La Liga to be relegated due to unpaid tax debts in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20La%20Liga">2014–15</a> season. Elche returned to La Liga in <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20La%20Liga">2020–21</a> after being promoted to the Segunda División and then La Liga in only three seasons.
History.
Foundation and early years.
Elche Club de Fútbol was founded in the winter of 1923, after the <a href="Mergers%20and%20acquisitions">merger</a> of all of the town's football teams. The club's first-ever game was against <a href="Mon%C3%B3var">Monóvar</a>, where they beat the home team 4–0, and its first official match was a 2–0 win over <a href="Crevillente%20Deportivo">Crevillente</a>. In its first years Elche, like many teams of the time, played in an all white uniform. The team played its first league season in 1929–30, in the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>, achieving promotion to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> in 1934. However, Elche suffered relegation for the first time six years later, but were promoted back the following season.
In the late 1950s, Elche achieved two consecutive promotions from the third level to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, securing the club's first promotion to the latter competition with a 3–0 success against <a href="CD%20Tenerife">Tenerife</a> in 1959.
1959–78: La Liga.
Elche opened <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20La%20Liga">its first season in the top level</a> with a 1–1 draw against <a href="Real%20Oviedo">Real Oviedo</a>, the first goal being scored by <a href="Vicente%20Pahuet">Vicente Pahuet</a>. The club finished tenth out of 16 sides, nine points ahead of relegated <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a> – the campaign included a 2–1 comeback home victory over <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, but also a 2–11 loss at <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20La%20Liga">The following season</a> saw the team having to compete in the <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation/promotion</a> play-off, where it overcame a 0–1 loss in the away leg against Atlético Ceuta with a 4–0 home victory.
Elche achieved their best-ever league finish in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20La%20Liga">1963–64</a>, ranking in fifth position. The season also saw the club's <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a>, <a href="Elche%20CF%20Ilicitano">Elche Ilicitano</a>, promote to <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>.
In <a href="1969%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo">1969</a> the club reached their first and only <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> final, following victories over <a href="Pontevedra%20CF">Pontevedra</a>, <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> and <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>. The semi-final against the latter was won 2–0 in a replay in neutral <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, as the tie had finished 4–4 on aggregate; the final, played on 15 June at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> in the same city, brought a 0–1 loss to <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>.
After twelve seasons Elche were relegated to division two in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20La%20Liga">1971</a>, having finished second from bottom. <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Two years later the team returned to the main category, as champions</a>. Its second spell in the top flight lasted five seasons, often immerse in relegation fights as the best campaign (<a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20La%20Liga">1974–75</a>) ended with the club in eighth position; at the end of <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20La%20Liga">1977–78</a> the side returned to the second division after finishing 17th out of 18 clubs, the last game being a 4–4 draw with <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, which was led 2–4 with five minutes remaining.
80s and 90s: severe financial crisis.
After the relegation Elche suffered in 1978, they never managed to gain promotion to the top flight – in fact, in the first five years since their return to the second level, they were fourth on three occasions and fifth on two (and on a further two, even on points with the third-placed team but with a worse goal difference), often losing the chance of promotion on the last matchday. Especially traumatic was the finish of the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20La%20Liga">1980–81 season</a>: with one game remaining, they were second two points ahead of <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a> and <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Racing de Santander</a>, only needing a draw against <a href="C%C3%A1diz%20CF">Cádiz</a> at the "<a href="Estadio%20Manuel%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Valero">Martínez Valero</a>"; the game ended however in a loss, and Elche finished with 45 points alongside <a href="CD%20Castell%C3%B3n">Castellón</a>, Cádiz, Racing and Rayo.
A promotion finally occurred at the end of <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1983–84</a>, even though Elche only finished fifth in the <a href="Season%20%28sports%29%23Regular%20season">regular season</a> – the first two positions were occupied by <a href="Real%20Madrid%20Castilla">Real Madrid Castilla</a> and <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao%20B">Athletic Bilbao B</a>, who could not promote as reserve sides. The whole of the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20La%20Liga">top division campaign</a> was spent in the relegation zone, and relegation consequently befell as 17th. In <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1988</a> they were promoted again for another cameo appearance, as the side went on to finish dead last with eighteen points, dropping down a category alongside <a href="Real%20Murcia">Real Murcia</a>, who they trailed by nine points; the last match for years in the category was a 1–3 away loss against <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a>, the goal coming courtesy of <a href="Alfonso%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Alfonso Fernández</a>.
After the relegation in 1989, Elche started to suffer heavily in the financial department, and relegated to <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> – the new third level created in 1977 – at the end of <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1990–91</a>. During the better part of the 1990s the club reached the second division promotion playoffs, only to consecutively fall short.
In <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">1997</a> Elche finally managed to return to the second category, being <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">immediately relegated back</a> but <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">gaining another promotion subsequently</a>.
2010s: return to the top flight.
In <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2010–11</a>, again in the "silver category", the team finished fourth and thus qualified for <a href="2011%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20play-offs">the play-offs</a>: after disposing of <a href="Real%20Valladolid">Real Valladolid</a> in the first round (3–2 on aggregate) the dream of top flight promotion ended at the hands of <a href="Granada%20CF">Granada</a>, on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>.
On 18 May 2013, following <a href="FC%20Barcelona%20B">Barcelona B</a> and <a href="AD%20Alcorcon">Alcorcón</a>'s 1–1 draw, Elche was <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">automatically promoted to the top level</a>, returning to the competition after 24 years. In the meantime the team coached by <a href="Fran%20Escrib%C3%A1">Fran Escribá</a> had broken a number of Segunda División records, being the only team to date able to lead the competition from the first until the last match of the season, setting in the process a new record of both matches won and points scored to date as well as the best first round in the history of Segunda's championship.
During the 2013–14 season, the team managed to keep in the top competition, with an average attendance to home matches estimated at 25,104 people.
In the 2014–15 season, despite managing once again to keep in the top flight (the team was already safe from relegation four dates before the end of the competition) Elche became the first team ever in the history of the Spanish "Primera División" being relegated to "Segunda" following new regulations by the Spanish football league limiting excess debt and economic mismanagement.
In the 2016–17 season, Elche were relegated to third level after 18 years in professional league.

Xerez finished in last place however, and was relegated. After several seasons of financial problems, the team was eventually relegated all the way to the fifth tier by 2016.
Team colours are usually blue shirt and socks, and white shorts.
History.
Due to the link between <a href="Jerez%20de%20la%20Frontera">Jerez de la Frontera</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> created by the exports of <a href="sherry">sherry</a> ("Jerez" in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>), football had its beginnings in the region towards the second half of the 19th century. In the early 20th century Sir Thomas Spencer, who worked with the William & Humbert <a href="winery">winery</a>, founded "Sociedad Jerez Foot-Ball Club" – he also served as chairman, player and captain.
From 1942 to 1947 the club had several names, ending with "Jerez Club Deportivo", which was changed to the current name in 1960s. Xerez first reached the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second division</a> in 1953–54, remaining there for five years; previously, in the 1940s, the team had promoted on the field but, due to the "high national interest" of the <a href="Francoist%20Spain">dictatorial government</a>, left its position to <a href="UD%20Espa%C3%B1a">España de Tánger</a>.
The team's new stadium, "<a href="Estadio%20Municipal%20de%20Chap%C3%ADn">Estadio Municipal de Chapín</a>", was inaugurated on 10 July 1988, replacing the old "Estadio Domecq" – the first match there was a friendly against <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. After decades in that category and also in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">the third</a>, it had a <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2001–02 second level campaign</a> which almost resulted in an historic <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> promotion, only one year after <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">doing the same thing</a>; the club seemed certain to gain promotion all season, but ultimately failed after a dramatic loss of form towards its closure, only gaining four points in the last eight matches.
Since then, Xerez finished in the top 10 in division two each campaign, except in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2007–08 season</a> when a weak start led to a 15th-place finish. <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">The following campaign</a> proved excellent, as the club was always in the top positions: on 13 June 2009, after beating <a href="SD%20Huesca">SD Huesca</a> 2–1 at home, it achieved promotion to the top division for the first time in its history. In the final day of the competition, a draw at <a href="Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a> proved enough for the title, as <a href="CD%20Tenerife">CD Tenerife</a> lost 1–2 home to <a href="CD%20Castell%C3%B3n">CD Castellón</a> in the final minute.
<a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20La%20Liga">The first season</a> of Xerez in the top flight would be short-lived, as it ended in relegation. After only collecting seven points from the first 19 games – which led to the sacking of coach <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20%C3%81ngel%20Ziganda">José Ángel Ziganda</a> – the club amassed 27 in the remaining 19 with <a href="N%C3%A9stor%20Gorosito">Néstor Gorosito</a> as boss, not good enough however to prevent the drop as last (the club, however, had chances to stay up until the final round, a 1–1 draw at <a href="CA%20Osasuna">CA Osasuna</a>).
Xerez ranked <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">eighth</a> and <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">14th</a> in the two following second level seasons, respectively. The <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2012–13 campaign</a>, however, was disastrous on all levels, as the team finished in 22nd and last position as a direct consequence of enduring serious financial difficulties for several years, and the situation culminated with the club being relegated to the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">fourth division</a> on 1 August.
After the Xerez's season, a group of supporters founded a new club in the lower leagues, named "<a href="Xerez%20Deportivo%20FC">Xerez Deportivo FC</a>" due to the club's institutional problems. While the latter was promoted to "Primera Provincial", the former was again relegated, this time to "Primera Andaluza", until May 2017, when Xerez came back to Tercera División. They managed a 16th-place finish in the 2017–18 season, avoiding relegation and managing another season in the Spanish fourth tier. The following season, Xerez improved and managed a 10th-place finish.

SD Eibar

Sociedad Deportiva Eibar (in ) is a <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20teams">professional Spanish football club</a> based in <a href="Eibar">Eibar</a>, <a href="Gipuzkoa">Gipuzkoa</a>, in the autonomous <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a>.
Founded on 30 November 1940, the team currently plays in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, the second tier of Spanish football, having been relegated from <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> at the end of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20La%20Liga">2020–21</a> season. The club played in the top tier of Spanish football for seven consecutive seasons from 2014 to 2021, and participated in 26 Segunda División seasons (a spell in the 1950s, and most of the 1990s and 2000s), spending the rest of their history competing at lower levels.
The team plays in claret and blue shirts with blue shorts (originating from the kit of <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>) and holds home games at the <a href="Ipurua%20Municipal%20Stadium">Ipurua Municipal Stadium</a>. SD Eibar is a fan-owned club, with about 8,000 shareholders from 48 countries. Until <a href="SD%20Huesca">SD Huesca</a> qualified for the top flight in 2018, the club was considered the smallest to have played in Spain's top division, and its stadium had the lowest capacity of any La Liga teams. Although Eibar is the sole professional club of its town, it contests several <a href="Basque%20football%20derbies">Basque derbies</a> with other clubs from the region.
Eibar is the only football club which has the quality certificate <a href="ISO%209001">UNE-EN-ISO 9001</a>.
History.
Establishment.
Formed by the <a href="Mergers%20and%20acquisitions">merger</a> of "Deportivo Gallo" and "Unión Deportiva Eibarresa", the club was originally known as "Eibar Fútbol Club", before changing to "Sociedad Deportiva Eibar". During the difficult postwar years, the team played sporadically, which caused Eibar to disappear from official competitions during the 1942–43 season. Originally an irregular team, it was not until the 1943–44 season that it was reorganised into more of a full-time unit.
Tercera División.
Promoted to <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> in 1950, Eibar achieved promotion to <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> three seasons later, <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">being relegated again after a five-year stint</a> and competing in division three for 25 of the following 28 years (in 1977 "Tercera" became the fourth level, after the creation of <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>). In <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">1988</a>, the side returned to the "silver category". That season also included a historic moment when goalkeeper <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ignacio%20Garmendia">José Ignacio Garmendia</a> scored a goal in a game against <a href="Pontevedra%20CF">Pontevedra</a> via a kickout from his own area.
Promotion to Segunda División.
After spending 18 years in a row in Segunda División, Eibar was relegated to the third division at the end of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2005–06 campaign</a>. However, it won its group <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">the next season</a>, thereby qualifying for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20Play-Off">promotion play-offs</a> where it won its semi-final tie against <a href="CE%20L%27Hospitalet">Hospitalet</a> 2–0 and defeated <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a> 2–1 on aggregate in the decisive round, sealing its return after just one year. Eibar finished 21st in the 2008–09 season meaning they were relegated to the Segunda Division B.
Relegation to Segunda B (2009–13).
Eibar qualified for three straight promotion play-offs but could not get promoted to the Segunda División.
In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2012–13 edition</a> of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, Eibar ousted <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque</a> neighbours <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> – who had appeared in two of the last four finals in the tournament – on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a> to reach the <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament">round-of-16</a> following a 1–1 draw at the <a href="San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%281913%29">San Mamés Stadium</a>. The decisive goal was scored by <a href="Mikel%20Arruabarrena%20Aranbide">Mikel Arruabarrena</a> who played youth football with the opposition, as did manager <a href="Gaizka%20Garitano">Gaizka Garitano</a>; <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">the same season</a> the team managed to return to the "silver category", following a four-year absence.
Segunda División and promotion to La Liga.
In <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2013–14</a> Eibar earned, for the first time in its history, one of two direct promotion berths to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, which was certified on 25 May 2014 with a 1–0 home win against <a href="Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s">Deportivo Alavés</a>. (they celebrated their feat with confetti originally produced by Barcelona, who wear the same colours and had anticipated winning the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">Spanish league title</a> a week earlier, but that did not come to pass). Simultaneously, however, the club was threatened with relegation back to division three due to the financial inability of the <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">S.A.D.</a> to have a <a href="share%20capital">share capital</a> of at least €2,146,525.95 before 6 August 2014. The club launched a campaign named "Defiende al Eibar" (Defend Eibar) with the aim of reaching the required share capital through a <a href="seasoned%20equity%20offering">seasoned equity offering</a>. On 15 July 2014 the club announced it had reached the established goal.
Eibar finished its first top-flight season in 18th, ending in relegation. However, after the season ended, 13th-placed <a href="Elche%20CF">Elche</a> were sent to the second tier as punishment for financial mismanagement, and Eibar were reinstated.
On 18 July 2015, Eibar played its 75th-anniversary game against <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> in <a href="Ipurua%20Municipal%20Stadium">Ipurua</a> (1–4). This included an inaugural ceremony on the pitch with a parade of 19th-century-clothed Basque soldiers with a <a href="Saltire">Saltire</a> and bagpipes playing "<a href="Scotland%20the%20Brave">Scotland the Brave</a>", with officials from both clubs shooting a 350 <a href="Kilogram">kg</a> <a href="Cannon%2318th%20and%2019th%20centuries">19th-century cannon</a>. Eibar stated that they invited Celtic as their opponent for the game due to the strong connection between the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a> and <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and also due to the Scottish presence in Eibar through the years (the main supporter group is named "Eskozia la Brava", meaning "Scotland the Brave").
Under its new coach <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Mendilibar">José Luis Mendilibar</a>, Eibar finished its <a href="2015-16%20La%20Liga">second top-flight season</a> in 14th. <a href="Borja%20Bast%C3%B3n">Borja Bastón</a> finished top ten in scoring and was named <a href="La%20Liga%20Player%20of%20the%20Month">La Liga Player of the Month</a> of October 2015, making him the first "Armero" to receive the award. In April 2017, <a href="Dani%20Garc%C3%ADa%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201990%29">Dani García</a> became the first player to reach the milestone of 100 top division appearances for the club.
The club's 10th place in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20La%20Liga">2016–17</a> was improved to 9th the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20La%20Liga">following season</a>, with the latter campaign marking the first time ever that Eibar had finished as the highest-ranking of the Basque teams.
On 16 May 2021, Eibar was relegated after a defeat to <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>. This ended their seven-year stay in the top tier. The following season in Segunda, Eibar was in the top two of the league for the majority of the season, however, the team had to eventually settle for third place. In the playoffs, Eibar lost to <a href="Girona%20CF">Girona</a>, and failed to make an immediate return to La Liga.
Affiliated clubs.
Vitoria.
In 2015, the club signed a collaboration agreement with <a href="CD%20Vitoria">CD Vitoria</a> (<a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>) to act as an Eibar <a href="farm%20team">feeder team</a> for emerging players. Eibar had previously disbanded their own <a href="SD%20Eibar%20B">B team</a> in 2012 to cut costs while the senior side languished in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> but decided to seek a new formal arrangement for a subsidiary club after retaining their place in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>. Within two years of the partnership, Vitoria gained promotion to the third tier for the first time in their history; they were relegated in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%23Group%202">2018–19</a> and their home matches back in the Tercera División were then moved to Eibar.
Eibar Urko.
In summer 2016, the club expanded its club structure further by integrating local team "Urkomendi" (of the 6th level <a href="Divisiones%20Regionales%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20in%20the%20Basque%20Country%23Preferente%20de%20Guip%C3%BAzcoa">Preferente de Guipúzcoa</a>) into the organisation as a <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a> to act as a link between the <a href="Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Honor%20Juvenil%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol">youth level</a> and Vitoria, to be known as "Eibar Urko".
Playing in the town's <a href="Unbe%20Sports%20Complex">Unbe Sports Complex</a>, Eibar Urko gained promotion to the provincial fifth level in 2018, but were blocked from a further promotion after Vitoria were relegated to the same due to rules preventing teams owned by the same club competing in the same division. This also meant Urko could not be promoted in the 2019–20 or 2020–21 seasons either, as Vitoria failed to achieve the same goal.
Logroñés.
Also in 2016, Eibar made a 3-year collaboration agreement with <a href="UD%20Logro%C3%B1%C3%A9s">UD Logroñés</a>, with Eibar players going on loan to the Segunda B club for experience with the aim of achieving promotion due to the additional talent in the squad. Four players made the move that summer: goalkeeper <a href="Jon%20Ander%20Felipe%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Jon Ander</a>, defender Amelibia, midfielder Sergio García and winger Thaylor.

History.
The club was founded on 1 March 1886 by a group of fifteen people who met at the "Cafè del Centre" on "Rambla Nova".

Later the club members began to organise <a href="fencing">fencing</a>, <a href="hiking">hiking</a>, <a href="boxing">boxing</a> and <a href="cycle%20sport">cycling</a>. In 1914, the club absorbed a local football club called the "Club Olímpic de Tarragona" and consequently formed its own football team using the former colours of Olímpic: red, white and black. In those days the team played home matches in the "Avenida Catalunya" stadium.
In January 1918, Gimnàstic made its debut as a football team in the "<a href="Catalan%20football%20championship">Campionat de Catalunya</a>" and by 1927 were crowned champions in the second division.

The team finished its debut first division season in <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20La%20Liga">seventh place</a>, with the highlight of the season coming on 11 January 1948 with a 3–1 win against the <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Bernabéu</a>, thus becoming the first team ever to do so. The club played two further seasons in the top level, being relegated in <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20La%20Liga">1949–50</a> after losing a play-off to the <a href="CD%20Alcoyano">CD Alcoyano</a>. The team moved to the new "<a href="Nou%20Estadi">Nou Estadi</a>" in 1972.
Fifty-six years later, for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">2006–07</a> season, Gimnàstic returned to the top flight. Along with coach <a href="Luis%20C%C3%A9sar%20Sampedro">Luis César Sampedro</a>, some of the players responsible for <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the promotion</a> included veterans <a href="Antonio%20Pinilla">Antonio Pinilla</a> and <a href="Albano%20Bizarri">Albano Bizarri</a>. <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Castro">Rubén Castro</a>, <a href="Ariza%20Makukula">Ariza Makukula</a> and <a href="Javier%20Portillo%20%28Spanish%20footballer%29">Javier Portillo</a> (eventually the team's top scorer) were also brought in. The club was placed in the relegation zone for 33 of the 38 rounds, eventually dropping down a division. Sampedro was replaced mid-season by <a href="Paco%20Flores">Paco Flores</a> who improved the team's numbers. In the middle of 2007 the club was crowned the <a href="Copa%20Catalunya">Copa Catalunya</a> champions after a 2–1 win over <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, with goals from Pinilla and <a href="Francisco%20Jos%C3%A9%20Maldonado">Tati Maldonado</a>.
After returning to the second level Gimnàstic achieved a mid-table position in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2007–08</a> and <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2008–09</a> with César Ferrando in charge of the team. However, in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2009–10</a> and <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2010–11 seasons</a>, the club only managed to rank one position above the relegation zone. In the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2011–12 campaign</a> the team was relegated to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> after only winning six games out of 42.
On 12 September 2012 Nàstic won the second Catalan Cup in its history, after defeating the <a href="AEC%20Manlleu">AEC Manlleu</a> with an <a href="Eugeni%20Valderrama%20Dom%C3%A8nech">Eugeni</a> goal. In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2014–15 campaign</a>, after finishing first in its group, the club returned to the second level after defeating the <a href="SD%20Huesca">SD Huesca</a> in <a href="2015%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">the play-offs</a>.

Real Unión Club, S.A.D. is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football club</a> based in <a href="Irun">Irun</a>, in the autonomous community of the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a>, in the province of <a href="Gipuzkoa">Gipuzkoa</a>, near the border with France. Founded on 15 May 1915 it currently plays in <a href="Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">Primera División RFEF – Group 2</a>, holding home matches at the 5,000-seater "<a href="Stadium%20Gal">Stadium Gal</a>". Real Unión was one of the founding members of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in 1929. The club spent four seasons in the Spanish elite, suffering relegation in 1932. Real is yet to return to the top tier, spending the rest of its history bouncing between the second and fourth tiers of Spanish football.
History.
Real Unión were among the early pioneering <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20teams">Spanish football</a> teams and, along with fellow <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque</a> clubs <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>, <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a> and <a href="Arenas%20Club%20de%20Getxo">Arenas Club de Getxo</a> were founding members of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, in 1928.
The club was formed in 1915 following the merger of "Irún Sporting Club" and "Racing Club de Irún". The former was founded in 1902 as "Irún Foot-Ball Club", changing its name in 1907. The latter, formed in 1908, had already won the <a href="1913%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1913 Copa del Rey</a>, beating Athletic Bilbao 1–0 in a replayed final. The club was briefly known as "Unión Club Irún" before <a href="Alfonso%20XIII">Alfonso XIII</a> gave the club royal approval, but during the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a> the club reverted to this name.
Real Unión then won the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> a further three times, beating <a href="Real%20Madrid">Real Madrid</a> in <a href="1918%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1918</a> and again in <a href="1924%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1924</a> (with former <a href="Derby%20County">Derby County</a> and <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> striker <a href="Steve%20Bloomer">Steve Bloomer</a> acting as their coach). In <a href="1927%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1927</a> they defeated Arenas Getxo in the first all-Basque <a href="1927%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">final</a>. The latter two finals both ended in 1–0 victories, with <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Echeveste">José Echeveste</a> netting the winner on both occasions. In <a href="1922%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1922</a> they were runners-up, losing 5–1 to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>. In 1930 they participated in the <a href="Coupe%20des%20Nations">Coupe des Nations</a> in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, Switzerland, a predecessor of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> since the champions of all major European football nations were invited, although it has never been entirely clear why Unión was invited as they had finished sixth in the <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20La%20Liga">1929–30 La Liga</a>. Nonetheless, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by <a href="SK%20Slavia%20Prague">Slavia Prague</a>. The club was relegated from <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20La%20Liga">1932</a>.
In 1920, when <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a> made their international debut at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201920%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympic Games</a>, the club provided the squad with two players—<a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Eguiaz%C3%A1bal">Eguiazábal</a> and <a href="Patricio%20Arabolaza">Patricio</a>, the latter scoring Spain's first-ever goal in international football in a 1–0 victory over <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Denmark</a> on 28 August 1920. Another Real Unión player, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Petit">René Petit</a>, took part in the same Olympic Games with <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>. In the 70s and 80s, Spanish internationals <a href="Javier%20Irureta">Javier Irureta</a> and <a href="Roberto%20L%C3%B3pez%20Ufarte">Roberto López Ufarte</a> began their career with the club.
On 11 November 2008, in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2008–09 Copa del Rey</a> against <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, Real Unión lost 3–4 at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu</a>, but secured a famous aggregate victory following a 3–2 home victory in the first leg (<a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>). It was the first time in history that Real Madrid were eliminated by a <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> team at home.
The club finally returned to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> in 2009 after a 44-year absence, successively defeating <a href="CE%20Sabadell%20FC">CE Sabadell FC</a> (2–1 aggregate) and <a href="AD%20Alcorc%C3%B3n">AD Alcorcón</a> (3–1) in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2008–09 promotion play-offs</a>. However, it would be a short-lived return, as the team <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">was immediately relegated, after ranking 21st</a>.

Having enjoyed its heyday in the 1960s, it even reached the <a href="Spanish%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">First Division</a>, leading it during November and December 1965.
History.
"Pontevedra Club de Fútbol" was founded in 1941, following the <a href="Mergers%20and%20acquisitions">merge</a> of the two top teams in the city at the time: "Eiriña FC" and "Alfonso XIII CF" The first president of the new club was Fernando Ponte Conde.
Pontevedra promoted to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in 1963 but was relegated <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20La%20Liga">a year after</a>, managing to play again in the top flight between 1965 and 1970. During this time the fans coined the motto "Hai que roelo", in reference to the difficulties rival teams had when playing a strong side, who <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20La%20Liga">achieved a seventh place in 1966</a>, <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20La%20Liga">adding an eighth two seasons later</a>; <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a> Ignacio Martín-Esperanza and forwards Neme and Roldán were among the stars of this era, and years following the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1972–73 season</a> saw the team more often than not struggling in lower categories, well into the 2000s.
Pontevedra returned to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> after 20 years on 27 June 2004, after winning their <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> group and defeating <a href="Lorca%20Deportiva%20CF">Lorca Deportiva CF</a> on the final day of the <a href="2004%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">playoffs</a>. The team struggled in their <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">one year</a> back in national professional football, finishing dead last but winning 4–1 at home in their final fixture against fellow relegated team <a href="UD%20Salamanca">UD Salamanca</a>.
On 23 January 2007 Pontevedra was transformed into a "<a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">Sociedad Anónima Deportiva</a>" (sporting <a href="Joint%20stock%20company">Joint stock company</a>), as required by Spanish law – this was a general measure introduced in order to revitalise the financial situation of professional football clubs. Yet, some risked disappearance as they could not face the cost involved in this transformation from "private" to "stock company". In the club's case this was made possible after then president, Nino Mirón, had purchased 52 per cent of the stock options; the club then added the letters "S.A.D." to its official name.
In <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2010–11</a>, Pontevedra had the stated aim of returning to the second tier, but following an economic crisis that saw them sell Brazilian star <a href="Igor%20de%20Souza">Igor de Souza</a>, the team were relegated to the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> for the first time in 27 years; relegation was sealed with a 5–1 home defeat to <a href="CD%20Guadalajara%20%28Spain%29">CD Guadalajara</a>. Four years later, the team bounced back, <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">winning their group</a> before defeating <a href="Haro%20Deportivo">Haro Deportivo</a> 3–1 on aggregate in the <a href="2015%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20play-offs">play-off</a> final.

Colours and crest.
The traditional colours of Pontevedra are <a href="Burgundy%20%28color%29">burgundy</a> shirt, blue shorts and burgundy socks. However, during certain periods white shorts and blue socks were also used, and even a blue and burgundy ribboned shirt for a short period of time.
The current colours are the traditional, with the crest of the club on the left upper part of the shirt. The name of the sponsor (if any) is normally placed in the centre of the shirt.
The crest is a fusion between the coat of arms of the city of <a href="Pontevedra">Pontevedra</a> and a football, displaying the name of the city/club and the letters "CF". The club has an official mascot called "Roélio", a walking bone dressed in the club colours who is a direct reference to the club's motto.
Stadium.
Pontevedra plays at the "<a href="Estadio%20Municipal%20de%20Pasar%C3%B3n">Estadio Municipal de Pasarón</a>". With a 105x68 meters playing field, it was built in 1956 and was partially refitted for the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 FIFA World Cup</a> celebrated in Spain; it did not hold any actual games in the tournament, but it benefitted from the general funds allocated to the refurbishment of football stadiums.
The stadium used to have a capacity for 16,500, including standing spectators. However, <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> regulations dictated that all attendants must be seated and, therefore, the stadium went under re-construction. – regardless, "Pasarón" was also in need of a general refurbishment, overdue since 1982. The works were completed for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2010–11 season</a>, with the new capacity being of 10,500 spectators.
"Pasarón" is located in the north side of the city (north to <a href="L%C3%A9rez%20River">Lérez River</a>), at Rúa de Luis Otero s/n, 36005. The stadium is owned by the local city council, the <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20190115134835/http%3A//www.pontevedra.eu/">"Concello de Pontevedra"</a>.

Foundation and early years (1949–1954).
In the aftermath of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, which ended a decade earlier, football in the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> was facing numerous challenges. The war disrupted the organisation of championships and created financial difficulties for the local clubs. Despite the construction of the <a href="Insular%20Stadium">Las Palmas Stadium</a> five years prior, the future of football in Gran Canaria was uncertain. Several prominent clubs, including Marino Fútbol Club, Real Club Victoria, Arenas Club, and Club Deportivo Gran Canaria, were struggling with financial issues. The geographical distance between the Canary Islands and the Spanish mainland made it economically impossible for these clubs to participate in national championships, which was essential for their growth and survival.
Manuel Rodríguez Monroy, along with the support of Adolfo Miranda, the president of the <a href="Canarian%20Football%20Federation">Regional Football Federation</a>, and other members of the board of directors, decided to propose a merger as a solution to the challenges facing the clubs. Although some clubs initially had reservations, including Marino and Victoria due to their history and social following, Gran Canaria, Atlético, and Arenas quickly embraced the idea. The formal discussions began in a meeting held at the Regional Football Federation's headquarters in <a href="Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a> on 28 February 1949. During this meeting, the representatives of the clubs decided to form a work team known as the Fusion Report, which would meet regularly to advance the merger proposal.
After more than a month of deliberations, Miranda and Monroy were tasked with presenting the proposal to the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Royal Spanish Football Federation</a>. On 4 April 1949, they submitted a letter requesting that the team resulting from the merger be included in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Second Division</a>. Initially, the request was rejected on the grounds that it could disadvantage other teams and alter promotion regulations. However, Ricardo Cabot, the secretary of the Royal Spanish Football Federation, promised to reconsider the proposal later. After a meeting in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> on 6 June 1949, Canary Islands football was accepted into the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">third division of Spanish football</a>, with the components of Las Palmas starting in the competition the following season.
The success of getting into national football led to the integration of Arenas and Gran Canaria under the name Unión Deportiva Las Palmas. This was the first phase of the merger, with the goal of eventually incorporating Atlético, Marino, and Victoria under the same banner. Despite progress, there were still disagreements among the clubs, including refusals to financially support the lease of the Las Palmas Stadium for UD Las Palmas to play its matches during the 1949–1950 season. In response to these challenges, Manuel Rodríguez Monroy organised a Magna Assembly on 22 August 1949, at the Real Club Náutico de Gran Canaria. The assembly aimed to finalise the formation of Unión Deportiva Las Palmas. During this assembly, concerns were resolved and Unión Deportiva Las Palmas was officially established for the upcoming season.
Las Palmas finished second in their first season in the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> (1949–50), ranking third in <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the following year's Segunda División</a> to reach <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> for the first time ever, and became the first Spanish club to achieve consecutive promotions in its first two years of existence. <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20La%20Liga">The first season in the top flight ended, however, in relegation</a>, but the team <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">returned to the category in 1954</a>, going on to enjoy a six-year spell.
Top-flight success.
After Las Palmas returned to La Liga at the end of the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1963–64 season</a>, again as champions, the club went on to have their most successful spell in the competition. Managed by <a href="Vicente%20Dauder">Vicente Dauder</a>, they finished third in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20La%20Liga">1967–68</a> behind <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, and four club players made the <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a> squad which hosted and won the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201964">UEFA Euro 1964</a> tournament; <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20La%20Liga">the following season</a> the team fared even better and only lost the league to Real Madrid, and thus qualified for <a href="UEFA">European competition</a> for the first time in its history, appearing in the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> and being knocked out in the first round by <a href="Germany">Germany</a>'s <a href="Hertha%20BSC">Hertha BSC</a> (0–0 home draw, 0–1 away loss).
Las Palmas player <a href="Juan%20Guedes">Juan Guedes</a> died suddenly on 9 March 1971 at the age of 28. <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20La%20Liga">The next season</a>, <a href="France">French</a> coach <a href="Pierre%20Sinibaldi">Pierre Sinibaldi</a> led the club to the fifth place, with subsequent <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20UEFA%20Cup">qualification</a> for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>: after disposing of <a href="Torino%20F.C.">Torino F.C.</a> and <a href="%C5%A0K%20Slovan%20Bratislava">ŠK Slovan Bratislava</a>, the Spaniards bowed out to <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> club <a href="FC%20Twente">FC Twente</a>; at the end of <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20La%20Liga">1974–75</a> another team player, <a href="Tonono">Tonono</a> – a <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">defender</a> who played with Guedes – died of a <a href="liver">liver</a> infection.
Las Palmas' third appearance in European competition came with the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20UEFA%20Cup">1977–78 UEFA Cup</a>, where they defeated <a href="FK%20Sloboda%20Tuzla">FK Sloboda Tuzla</a> of <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> in the first round before falling to the English side <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. Under the management of <a href="Miguel%20Mu%C3%B1oz">Miguel Muñoz</a>, and with players such as <a href="Argentina">Argentines</a> <a href="Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Brindisi">Miguel Ángel Brindisi</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Carnevali">Daniel Carnevali</a> (the first to arrive in 1973), <a href="Carlos%20Morete">Carlos Morete</a> and <a href="Quique%20Wolff">Quique Wolff</a>, the club also <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Copa%20del%20Rey">reached their first</a> final of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> in that year, losing on 19 April to Barcelona at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> (1–3).
From the 1990s onwards, Las Palmas played mainly in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, but also spent six years in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> – the new third level created in 1977 – and, from 2000 to 2002, competed in the top flight. On 3 October 2001 the side managed a 4–2 home win against Real Madrid, with youth product <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Castro">Rubén Castro</a> scoring two goals for the hosts, but <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20La%20Liga">the season ended nonetheless in relegation</a>. On 22 December 2001, Las Palmas played its 1,000th game in La Liga. In the 2009–10 season in Segunda División the club finished 17th, just one point away from being relegated to Segunda División B. On 21 June 2015, Las Palmas was promoted back to La Liga after defeating <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a> on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>.
On 27 May 2023, Las Palmas achieved promotion to the first division by sealing a 2nd position in the table, respectively, on the very last match day of the season, after spending five years in the second tier.
Ciudad deportiva.
The Ciudad Deportiva UD Las Palmas, also known as Barranco Seco, is the training ground of UD Las Palmas. Occupying a total area of 70,000 m², the complex is located in the area known as "Barranco Seco" at the southern outskirts of the city of Las Palmas. 
History and construction.
The current land in Barranco Seco was acquired by UD Las Palmas during the 1960s by the efforts of then club director Manuel Betancor. During the 1970s, there was only a single training pitch used by the reserve and junior teams of the club. In 1982, when the ground was upgraded to be used as a training field by the first team.
In June 2015, the "Ciudad Deportiva" project was initiated. However, works did not start until 2017. After around 2 years of construction works, the complex was finally opened on July 8, 2019. It was designed by architect Juan Palop-Casado, who assured that the construction of this project was "an attempt that has been made to build with the greatest possible sustainability". The construction was executed by "Construcciones Alex y Nadal, S.L.", involving around 380 workers, 10,000 tons of sand, nearly 300 tons of steel, almost 2,000 cubic meters of concrete and beams of approximately 1,600 meters.
Being only the first phase of the entire sports city project, the club invested 22.5 million euros of its own funds to carry out the construction works of the current facilities. The construction of a multifunctional service building is scheduled in the second phase. The eventual area of the complex will become 70,000 m² after the completion of the second phase.
Facilities.
The new complex has modern changing rooms, a meeting hall, a gym with physiotherapy facilities, a dining room, a press room, in addition to two parking spaces designated for 130 vehicles. The Ciudad Deportiva is home to 3 regular size training pitches:

Crest.
Las Palmas' badge is a blue shield with yellow scrolls on top with the club's name, city and archipelago. The municipal arms, granted by the city's mayor, feature in the centre of the design. Underneath lie the five crests of the clubs which united in 1949 to create the club: from left to right – Victoria, Arenas, Deportivo, Marino and Atlético; a smaller white scroll above them displays the city motto "Segura tiene la palma".
In <a href="Football%20in%20Spain">Spanish football</a>, many clubs possess royal patronage and thus are permitted to use the prefix "Real" in their name and use an image of the Spanish crown. Las Palmas does not have such patronage, but tops its crest with the Spanish crown due to the patronage held by Real Club Victoria.
The crest is the central emblem of the club flag, a horizontal bicolour with yellow on top and blue underneath. The flag of the island of Gran Canaria uses these colours diagonally.

Unión Deportiva Salamanca, S.A.D. () was a historical <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Salamanca">Salamanca</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Castile%20and%20Le%C3%B3n">Castile and León</a>.
Founded on 9 February 1923 and nicknamed "Los Charros", the club played in white shirts and black shorts, holding home games at "<a href="Helm%C3%A1ntico%20Stadium">Estadio Helmántico</a>", which seated 17,341 spectators.
History.
Initially formed by <a href="Ireland">Irish</a> students, Salamanca first played in early Spanish championships in 1907, before an official league was founded later on. On 16 March 1923, at the tables of <a href="Caf%C3%A9%20Novelty">Café Novelty</a>, situated in the <a href="Plaza%20Mayor%2C%20Salamanca">Plaza Mayor</a>, <a href="Dionisio%20Ridruejo">Dionisio Ridruejo</a> set the club's early official foundations and, from 1939 and during the following three decades, it fluctuated between the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">third</a> and the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second levels</a> of the <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football league</a>.
In the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20La%20Liga">1974–75 season</a>, Salamanca made its <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> debuts, overachieving for a final 7th position (out of 18 teams), which eventually would be its best classification ever. The team lasted in the topflight until 1981, mainly coached by José Luis García Traid, then returned the following year for a further two seasons, being further relegated to "<a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>" – the new third division created in 1977 – in <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1984–85</a>, and spending three years in that category before promoting back.
In <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1994–95's second division</a>, after finishing fourth in the league, Salamanca lost the first leg of the <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion/relegation</a> playoffs against <a href="Albacete%20Balompi%C3%A9">Albacete Balompié</a>, 0–2 at home, but won 5–0 away, returning to the main level after eleven years. The club was managed by 29-year-old <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20Lillo">Juan Manuel Lillo</a>, also in charge for <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20La%20Liga">the following season</a>, as the <a href="Castile%20and%20Le%C3%B3n">Castile and León</a> club ranked 22nd and last in the top level.
From 1999 onwards (with two more visits to the first division, with 15th and 20th-place finishes respectively), Salamanca stabilized in the second level, save for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2005–06 season</a> spent in the third division, with the club winning the regular season and promoting in the playoffs. Veteran <a href="Quique%20Mart%C3%ADn">Quique Martín</a> was arguably the most important player of the club in the decade, whilst Argentine <a href="Jorge%20D%27Alessandro">Jorge D'Alessandro</a>, who held the record for most games in the top division in the club's history, worked with the team as a manager in a further two spells (three in total).
<a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2010–11</a> brought a club record ten consecutive defeats between December 2010/February 2011, and two coaching changes, as Salamanca returned to the third division after five years. On 18 June 2013, 90 years after its foundation, the club was liquidated due to the accumulation of unpaid debts.

History.
Foundation.
RC Celta de Vigo was formed as a result of the ambition of Vigo's teams to achieve more at national level, where the <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> sides had been their "bête noire" in the Spanish Championship. The idea was to merge both Vigo-based teams, <a href="Real%20Vigo%20Sporting">Real Vigo Sporting</a> and <a href="Real%20Club%20Fortuna%20de%20Vigo">Real Club Fortuna de Vigo</a>, to create a more powerful team at national level. The standard-bearer of this movement was Manuel de Castro, known as "Handicap", a sports writer for the "<a href="Faro%20de%20Vigo">Faro de Vigo</a>" who, from 1915, began to write in his articles about the need for a unitarian movement. The slogan of his movement was "Todo por y para Vigo" ("All for and to Vigo"), which eventually found support among the managers of both clubs. It was backed unanimously when De Castro himself presented the motion at the assembly of the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Royal Spanish Football Federation</a> in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> on 22 June 1923.
On 12 July 1923, the merger was approved at the annual general meetings of Vigo and Fortuna, held at the Cine Odeón and Hotel Moderno, respectively. At the last general meeting of Fortuna and Vigo, which approved the formation of the new club and was held on 10 August, the members decided on the name and colours of the team. Among the various names proposed were Club Galicia, Real Atlético FC, Real Club Olímpico, Breogán and Real Club Celta. The latter two names were the most liked and in the end they decided on Club Celta, an ethnic race linked to <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a>. The first president of Celta was Manuel Bárcena de Andrés, the Count of Torre Cedeira. This assembly also decided on the squad, which totaled 64 players and included some important players from Fortuna and Vigo, and was managed by <a href="Francis%20Cuggy">Francis Cuggy</a>. Their first match was a <a href="Exhibition%20game%23Association%20football">friendly</a> against Portuguese side <a href="Boavista%20F.C.">Boavista</a>, which Celta won 8–2.
In 1947–48, Celta ranked fourth, the club's joint highest ever finish, and reached the <a href="1948%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">Copa del Generalísimo Final</a>, where they lost 4–1 to <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla FC</a>. Local striker <a href="Pahi%C3%B1o">Pahiño</a>, who took the <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">Pichichi Trophy</a> for 21 goals in 22 games that season, subsequently moved to <a href="Real%20Madrid">Real Madrid</a>.
EuroCelta and subsequent decline.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Celta were dubbed "EuroCelta" by the Spanish press as a result of their European performance. This included a 4–1 aggregate win against <a href="Liverpool%20FC">Liverpool</a> in a run to the quarter-finals of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Cup">1998–99 UEFA Cup</a>. In the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Cup">next season's edition</a> they again reached the last eight, with a 4–0 second leg win over <a href="Juventus">Juventus</a> and a 7–0 home win against <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> (8–1 on aggregate). Domestically, the team reached the <a href="2001%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20final">2001 Copa del Rey final</a>, losing 3–1 to <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a> in <a href="Seville">Seville</a>.
Key players during the period included <a href="Alexander%20Mostovoi">Alexander Mostovoi</a>, <a href="Valery%20Karpin">Valery Karpin</a> and <a href="Haim%20Revivo">Haim Revivo</a>, though the squad also relied upon other international players as well, such as goalkeeper <a href="Pablo%20Cavallero">Pablo Cavallero</a>; defender and future coach <a href="Eduardo%20Berizzo">Eduardo Berizzo</a>, midfielders <a href="Claude%20Mak%C3%A9l%C3%A9l%C3%A9">Claude Makélélé</a> and <a href="Mazinho">Mazinho</a>; winger <a href="Gustavo%20Adri%C3%A1n%20L%C3%B3pez">Gustavo López</a>; and strikers <a href="Catanha">Catanha</a> and <a href="Lyuboslav%20Penev">Lyuboslav Penev</a>, amongst others.
In 2002–03, under manager <a href="Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Lotina">Miguel Ángel Lotina</a>, Celta ranked fourth, their highest finish since 1948, and qualified for the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2003–04 UEFA Champions League</a>. They reached the round of 16, where they were eliminated by <a href="Arsenal%20FC">Arsenal</a> 5–2 on aggregate. Domestically that year, the team came 19th and suffered relegation to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>. Although the squad was heavily dismantled following the demotion, Celta earned an immediate return to the top flight after finishing second in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2004–05</a>.
In <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">2006–07</a>, Celta finished 18th and were once again relegated to the Segunda División. The team subsequently fought against relegation to the third tier, and the risk of bankruptcy. This trend was bucked in the 2010–11 season, when new striker <a href="David%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20S%C3%A1nchez">David Rodríguez</a>, winger <a href="Enrique%20de%20Lucas">Enrique de Lucas</a> and manager <a href="Paco%20Herrera">Paco Herrera</a> helped them finish sixth. They were eliminated in the first knockout round by <a href="Granada%20CF">Granada</a> after a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a>, the game having finished 1–1 in 90 minutes.
Return to La Liga and Europe.
On 3 June 2012, Celta returned to La Liga after a five-year absence. In their first season after returning to the top flight, they avoided relegation to the Segunda División on the final day after beating <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">RCD Espanyol</a> 1–0 to ensure a 17th-place finish.
Under "EuroCelta" veteran <a href="Eduardo%20Berizzo">Eduardo Berizzo</a> in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20La%20Liga">2015–16</a>, Celta finished sixth for their best result in a decade and earned a spot in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2016–17 UEFA Europa League</a>. In their return to European competitions, Celta reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2016–17 UEFA Europa League</a>, where they were eliminated by eventual champions <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>.

Celta's original crest was rather simple, featuring a red shield with two stylised letter Cs (Club Celta) and the <a href="Regalia%20of%20Spain">royal crown</a> of Spain; in the year of its foundation, the club became one of a number of Spanish football clubs to be granted patronage by <a href="Alfonso%20XIII">Alfonso XIII</a> and thus the right to use the honorific "real" (Royal) in its name and the crown on its badge. The following year the shield's colour was changed to the traditional sky blue colour. Like many other Galician clubs, such as <a href="SD%20Compostela">Compostela</a> and <a href="Racing%20de%20Ferrol">Racing Ferrol</a>, the crest also features the red <a href="cross%20of%20Saint%20James">cross of Saint James</a> which was added in 1928. During the <a href="Spanish%20Second%20Republic">Spanish Second Republic</a> (1931–1936), the honorific title and crown were removed from the club's name and crest; however, it was to return under the <a href="Spanish%20State">Spanish State</a>.
Kit.
Celta's home colours are sky blue and white. Originally, their home strip consisted of a red shirt, black shorts and blue socks. This was later changed at an unknown date to the current colours, representative of the <a href="Galician%20flag">Galician flag</a>.
Celta had the longest-running sponsorship deal in Spanish football, and one of the longest-running in the world, with the French automobile manufacturer <a href="Citro%C3%ABn">Citroën</a> from 1985 to 2016. The company established its plant within walking distance from Balaídos in 1958, and had first sponsored the club's women's basketball team in 1980. In 2016, the sponsor was changed to that of Galician brewery, <a href="Estrella%20Galicia">Estrella Galicia</a>, which had advertised on the back of the shirts since 2011. Their business deal with kit supplier, <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a>, was also one of the longest-running ones, from 1986 to 2010.

It is located in the neighborhood of <a href="Nervi%C3%B3n%2C%20Seville">Nervión, Seville</a>, and is named after the late <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez-Pizju%C3%A1n">Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán</a>, who was the president of Sevilla FC for a total of 17 years.
History.
Foundation to Civil War.
The practice of football was introduced in Seville at the end of the 19th century by the large <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> expatriate population in the city, composed by owners or managers of manufacturing companies based in the capital of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. <a href="Sevilla%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Club">Sevilla Fútbol Club</a> was founded on 25 January 1890 as "Sevilla Foot-ball Club" (in English).
Sevilla FC was duly formed on 25 January 1890 while a group of young British, mainly Scots, along with other young men of Spanish origin, celebrated <a href="Burns%20supper">Burns Night</a> in Seville. The club's founding document, published on the "<a href="Dundee%20Courier">Dundee Courier</a>"'s edition of 17 March 1890 describes in full detail the formation of the club and how those young founding members decided first to play under Association Rules, secondly to bear the word "football" within its name and thirdly, to elect their "office-bearers". The following paragraph is an extract of that article:
The club's first president was the Scot Mr. <a href="Edward%20F.%20Johnston">Edward Farquharson Johnston</a> (Elgin, 14 October 1854), who was the British vice-consul in Seville and co-proprietor of the firm MacAndrews & Co., ship-owners with commercial lines between Spain and the UK, one of them being the transport of <a href="Seville%20orange">Seville orange</a>s. <a href="Hugh%20MacColl%20%28footballer%29">Hugh MacColl</a>, another Scottish young man (Glasgow, 9 June 1861), a marine engineer who at that time had moved to Seville to work as the technical manager of Portilla White foundry, was their first captain. One of Maccoll's partners in the Portilla White foundry in Seville, Isaias White junior, was the club's first secretary. He was the son of an English entrepreneur who founded the aforesaid company, one of the major foundries in Spain at the end of the 19th century.
In order to celebrate the foundation of the club, <a href="Isaias%20White">Isaias White</a> sent a letter to Huelva Recreation Club, to invite them to play a football match in Seville. That letter was published by the Spanish newspaper "La Provincia". The Huelva club accepted the invitation and the match took place on 8 March 1890, being thus the <a href="First%20football%20match%20in%20Spain">first official match ever played in Spain</a>. Sevilla FC won that historical match 2–0, with the first goal in an official match in Spanish football history scored by the Seville team player Ritson. Isaias lived at Calle Bailen 41 in Seville (the house still exists but has since been renumbered) making this the first home of Sevilla FC.
In 1907, Sevilla Balompíe was founded, followed by Betis Football Club in 1909, Recreativo de Sevilla and Español de Sevilla. More clubs were formed as the years passed and more competitive matches were organized between the teams, although Sevilla FC, the oldest club of the city, imposed its supremacy over the other clubs in this early period. 
In 1912, the first Copa de Sevilla was played and won by Sevilla FC. From 1915 to 1940, the <a href="Campeonato%20Regional%20Sur">Campeonato Regional Sur</a> (also known as the Copa Andalucía) was organized by the "Federación Sur" (<a href="Royal%20Andalusian%20Football%20Federation">Andalusian FA</a>) and these championships included Sevilla FC, Real Betis Balompié, Recreativo de Huelva, Español de Cádiz and the sporadic participation of other clubs such as Nacional de Sevilla and Córdoba. The domination of Sevilla was so evident that of the 20 championships played, 17 were won by Sevilla FC, (the three remaining being won by Español de de Cádiz, Recreativo de Huelva and Real Betis Balompié).
In 1917, Sevilla FC participated in the "Copa de España" for the first time and became the first Andalusian team to reach the final round of the competition. In 1928, when the "Campeonato Nacional de Liga" (National League Championships) was organized, Sevilla FC was not part of the First Division due to their defeat to <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Racing de Santander</a> in an elimination game that was set-up to decide which of the two teams would compete in the newly formed league.
At the end of the 1933–34 season, Sevilla FC was promoted to the First Division of the "Campeonato Nacional de Liga." In 1935, they were proclaimed "Campeón de Copa" (Cup Champions) for the first time by defeating <a href="CE%20Sabadell%20FC">Sabadell</a>, repeated in 1939 against <a href="Racing%20de%20Ferrol">Racing de Ferrol</a> and again in 1948 against <a href="Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a>. The club participated in two other finals, but conceded defeat to <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> in 1955 and to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> in 1962. Sevilla FC remained in the First Division from the 1933–34 season until 1968, when they were relegated to the Second Division, a tier from which they have never further been relegated from.
The 1945–46 season was one of high importance in the history of Sevilla, as it marked the first, and to date only, time in which Sevilla FC were League champions. On four other occasions, the club was proclaimed "subcampeón de Liga" (League Runner-up: 1939–40, 1942–43, 1950–51 and 1956–57).
Including the 2021–22 season, Sevilla has participated 78 times in the First Division and 13 in the Second Division, never dropping below the Second Division. Sevilla has also participated in four European tournaments, the "Copa de Europa" (European League Winners Cup) (1957–58); Recopa (Winners Cup) (1962–63) and <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> on nine occasions (1966–67, 1970–71, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1990–91, 1995–96, 2004–05, 2005–06 and 2006–07). Sevilla also participated in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2007–08</a>.
There are more than 400 individuals who currently play for the Sevilla FC organization, which includes two semi-professional teams (in Second Division A – second national category) and 12 youth teams.
Sevilla has always counted on having international players within its ranks to aid in the pursuit of trophies. The first of these players were Spencer and Herminio in the 1920s. Juan Arza, an international player from the 1940s, was proclaimed top scorer of the Spanish League in the 1954–55 season, with 29 goals. About 30 Sevilla players have been chosen to play for the <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spain national football team</a> over the years.
Foreign players have always played an integral part in the success of Sevilla FC with Diego Maradona representing the most well known among them during his spell with the club during the 1992–93 season. During the same season, Sevilla FC was managed by Carlos Salvador Bilardo, a world champion manager.
Historically, Sevilla FC has fielded teams in a variety of other sports including: basketball, rugby, rowing, athletics, and <a href="Olympic%20weightlifting">weightlifting</a> or petanca. Presently, Sevilla FC counts twenty-five professional teams on its ledgers (one of these being in the second national category) and a women's football team in the Honor Division.
Sevilla FC's stadium, the <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Pizju%C3%A1n%20Stadium">Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán</a>, was inaugurated in 1958 and is one of the largest stadiums in Spain, and has the honor of hosting a World Cup semi-final match in <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982</a>. After its final completion, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 75,000 spectators, but since its latest remodelling, the stadium has been converted to an all-seat with a covering added to the main seating area, reducing the capacity to its current count of 45,000 spectators.
First successes.
Sevilla had their first spell of national success in the decade following the end of the Civil War, winning the <a href="1945%E2%80%9346%20La%20Liga">1945–46 La Liga</a> title and two <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> titles. In the first season of this (1939–40), Sevilla won the cup on 25 June, beating Racing de Ferrol 6–2 in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. That same season, the side lost the Liga title on the last day to <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> after drawing 3–3 against <a href="H%C3%A9rcules%20CF">Hércules</a>. The Sevilla forward line was known as "los stukas" after the <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">German bomber aircraft</a>, and scored 216 goals over four seasons. It comprised López, Torrontegui, <a href="Campanal%20I">Campanal</a>, Raimundo, Berrocal and <a href="Pepillo%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201916%29">Pepillo</a>.
In 1941, President <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Pizju%C3%A1n">Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán</a> left the club to manage the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Spanish Football Federation</a>. After his departure, Antonio Sánchez Ramos occupied temporarily occupied the position until the permanent appointment of Jerónimo Domínguez y Pérez de Vargas, Marquess of Contadero, who was president of the club for six years until the return of Sánchez Pizjuán. Sevilla was runner-up to Athletic Bilbao in the 1942–43 season and came third a season later. Sevilla won its only Liga title in 1945–46, edging <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> by one point. Two years later, Sevilla won the <a href="1948%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1948 Copa del Rey</a> after beating Celta de Vigo 4–1 in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> on 4 July.
The most significant signing of those years was the Spanish international striker <a href="Juan%20Arza">Juan Arza</a>. There was also the debut of the Campanal's nephew, defender Campanal II, with his uncle as a trainer. During the 1950–51 season, with Campanal acting as the coach, the team finished runner-up in La Liga, two points behind Atlético Madrid. Before the 1953–54 season, Argentinean coach <a href="Helenio%20Herrera">Helenio Herrera</a> was hired. During his time in charge, the club came fifth in the 1953–54 season, fourth in both 1954–55 and 1955–56 and second to Real Madrid in 1956–57. 
In 1954, the club put the construction of the new stadium out to tender because Nervión Stadium was becoming too small for the club's fanbase. In the 1954–55 season, Arza won the <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">Pichichi Trophy</a> as La Liga's top scorer, with 28 goals, and the team was runner-up in the Copa del Rey. In 1955, for the club's 50th anniversary, a triangular tournament was organized against the French club <a href="Stade%20de%20Reims">Stade de Reims</a> and the Swedish club <a href="IFK%20Norrk%C3%B6ping">IFK Norrköping</a>; Sevilla won.
On 28 October 1956, President Sánchez Pizjuán suddenly died. As an appreciation to the deceased leader under whose chairmanship Sevilla had won three Copas del Rey, the fans decided that the club's planned new stadium was to be named in his honour. In the 1956–57 season, the team were Liga runners-up behind Real Madrid, ensuring qualification for the first time to the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>. Herrera left the club at the end of the season. The club needed a victory on the final day of the next season to avoid relegation but reached the round of 8 of the European Cup before being knocked out by holders and eventual champions Real Madrid.
After the death of the President, Ramón de Carranza assumed the position for four years. It is said that he spoke these words at Sánchez Pizjuán's tomb:
"Dear Ramón, now your friends, among who I am honored to be one, is going to give you Christian burial, and on the following day, giving your body to the ground, we will start working and your dream that the Sevilla FC has a grand stadium will become a reality. Ramón, go in peace to heaven because your wishes will be fulfilled."
Being true to his words, Carranza made obligation bonds amounting to 50 million pesetas, and a month and a half after Sánchez Pizjuán's death, the first stone in the stadium's construction was placed. The architect was Manuel Muñoz Monasterio, co-designer of the recently built <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a>, the home of Real Madrid. The <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Pizju%C3%A1n%20Stadium">Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium</a> was ultimately opened on 7 September 1958 as Sevilla played an inaugural friendly against fellow Andalusian club <a href="Real%20Ja%C3%A9n">Real Jaén</a>. The stadium's first official match was on the opening day of the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20La%20Liga">1958–59 season</a>, where Sevilla beat cross-city Real Betis 4–2.
Crisis and stability.
In the 1970s, Sevilla was forced into selling its top players in order to pay off debts incurred from the construction of its new stadium; <a href="Manuel%20Ruiz%20Sosa">Manuel Ruiz Sosa</a> transferred to Atlético Madrid, <a href="Gallego%20%28footballer%29">Gallego</a> to Barcelona and Juan Batista Agüero to Real Madrid. Moreover, part of the adjacent land to the stadium was also sold to a bank. In the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20La%20Liga">1967–68 season</a>, Sevilla returned to the Second Division for the first time in 31 years but was promoted back after one season. The next season, Austrian coach <a href="Max%20Merkel">Max Merkel</a>, nicknamed "Mr. Whip" for his usage of severe and harsh discipline techniques and training, was hired. 
That season, the club finished third in the league. However, the club was relegated again at the end of the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20La%20Liga">1972–73 season</a>. In 1973, Sevilla signed their first-ever black player, Gambian winger <a href="Biri%20Biri">Biri Biri</a>, from the Danish club <a href="Boldklubben%201901">Boldklubben 1901</a>. He remained at the club until 1978 and became a cult figure, with an <a href="ultras">ultra group</a> named after him surviving to this day. In the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20La%20Liga">1974–75 season</a>, with the Argentine <a href="Roque%20Olsen">Roque Olsen</a> in charge, the club returned to the First Division. In the late 1970s, Sevilla signed Argentinians such as <a href="H%C3%A9ctor%20Scotta">Héctor Scotta</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Bertoni">Daniel Bertoni</a>.
Directed first by Miguel Muñoz and later by Manolo Cardo, the team participated in two consecutive seasons of the UEFA Cup from 1981 to 1983. The 75th anniversary of the club was celebrated with a variety of social events and a match against the Brazilian side <a href="Santos%20FC">Santos</a>. In 1982, the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> was held in Spain and Sevilla's Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán was the venue for the semi-final match between <a href="West%20Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a> and <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>. In 1984, Eugenio Montes Cabeza finished his 11-year presidency and was replaced by the cattle businessman Gabriel Rojas, who as the vice-president had made several advancements to the club's stadium. In the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20La%20Liga">1985–86 season</a>, Manolo Cardo left his management position after five years in charge, while <a href="Francisco%20L%C3%B3pez%20Alfaro">Francisco</a> played in the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 FIFA World Cup</a> for Spain. <a href="Vicente%20Cantatore">Vicente Cantatore</a> led the club to UEFA Cup qualification at the end of the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20La%20Liga">1989–90 season</a>, with <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n forward <a href="Toni%20Polster">Toni Polster</a> scoring a club-record 33 Liga goals. 
In the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20La%20Liga">1992–93 season</a>, after several months of negotiations, world-renowned Argentine <a href="Diego%20Maradona">Diego Maradona</a> signed from <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a> for a fee of $7.5 million. His time at the club, however, was unsuccessful, and he was released in large part due to his periodic injuries and clashes with coach Bilardo. In the following seasons, <a href="Luis%20Aragon%C3%A9s">Luis Aragonés</a> became manager and finished the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20La%20Liga">1994–95 season</a> with qualification to next season's UEFA Cup.
At the end of the 1994–95 season, despite the pleas of the club's directors, Sevilla, along with Celta de Vigo, were one of two clubs relegated from the top flight on reasons of administration, provoking action from fans. The action resulted in both Sevilla and Celta being reinstated to La Liga.
These events led to an institutional instability, with the season seeing four presidents and three managers take charge. Sevilla was relegated at the end of the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20La%20Liga">1996–97 season</a> but returned in 1999. At the beginning of the 21st century, the presidency of the club was assumed by the popular Roberto Alés. The situation of the club was very delicate at the time; the team had dropped back to the Second Division in 2000 and the squad was weakened by player retirements and the sales of key players. The club opted for a relatively unknown trainer, <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Caparr%C3%B3s">Joaquín Caparrós</a>, who helped the team win the Second Division with three matches to spare in just his first season at the helm.
Successes in the 21st century.
In May 2002, Roberto Alés resigned as president, and the Sevillian lawyer José María del Nido assumed the presidency. One of his first decisions was to confirm Caparrós as a coach and <a href="Monchi">Monchi</a> as sporting director.
On 6 October 2002, before a <a href="Seville%20derby">Seville derby</a> against Betis at the Sánchez Pizjuán, four Sevilla fans, including a minor, assaulted a security guard. The attack was punished by Sevilla being forced to play their next four home matches behind closed doors, the longest term ever given to a La Liga side. The club finished sixth in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20La%20Liga">2003–04 La Liga</a>, giving the club qualification for the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup">2004–05 UEFA Cup</a> and marking a return to continental competition for the first time since the 1995–96 season. In the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20La%20Liga">2004–05</a> league season, Sevilla finished sixth and qualified for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">following season's UEFA Cup</a>, entering the competition in the third qualifying round.
This set up Sevilla's first-ever European triumph in the <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">2006 UEFA Cup Final</a> at the <a href="Philips%20Stadion">Philips Stadion</a> in <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a> on 10 May 2006. The club defeated English club <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> 4–0 under new manager <a href="Juande%20Ramos">Juande Ramos</a>, with the scoring opened by Brazilian striker <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Fabiano">Luís Fabiano</a>. In the second-half, Italian substitute <a href="Enzo%20Maresca">Enzo Maresca</a> scored twice to be named Man of the Match, and Malian striker <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Kanout%C3%A9">Frédéric Kanouté</a> finished the scoring, to give the club its first major title in 58 years on the season of its centenary, which was celebrated in October 2005.
Sevilla opened their <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">2006–07 season</a> by winning the <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2006 UEFA Super Cup</a> on 25 August 2006 with a 3–0 victory over Champions League winners and compatriots Barcelona at the <a href="Stade%20Louis%20II">Stade Louis II</a> in <a href="Monaco">Monaco</a>. The goals were scored by <a href="Renato%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201979%29">Renato</a>, Kanouté and a late penalty by Maresca. The season ended with a second consecutive UEFA Cup win, this time against fellow Spanish club <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">Espanyol</a> at <a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a>, <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>. The match went to penalties after finishing 2–2 after extra-time, with Sevilla goalkeeper <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Palop">Andrés Palop</a> saving three of Espanyol's penalties.
On 12 November 2006, Sevilla played its 2,000th game in La Liga. Sevilla defeated <a href="Getafe%20CF">Getafe</a> in the <a href="2007%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2007 Copa del Rey Final</a>, with Kanouté scoring the only goal in the game's 11th minute. Sevilla finished third in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">that season's La Liga</a> to qualify for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2007–08 Champions League</a>, returning to the competition for the first time in 50 years. As a result of these successes, Sevilla was voted as the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Football%20History%20%26amp%3B%20Statistics">IFFHS</a> Team of the Year for the second consecutive season, becoming the first club to achieve this.
Sevilla won the <a href="2007%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">2007 Supercopa de España</a> against La Liga champions Real Madrid. The season started to derail, however, after defender <a href="Antonio%20Puerta">Antonio Puerta</a> suffered a heart attack in the first game of the season and died three days later on 28 August. Three days after his death, Sevilla then lost 3–1 to <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> in the <a href="2007%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2007 UEFA Super Cup</a> in Monaco. Juande Ramos, the individual largely responsible for Sevilla's recent successes, resigned as manager on 27 October to take the post with <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>; he was replaced by <a href="Sevilla%20Atl%C3%A9tico">Sevilla Atlético</a> manager <a href="Manuel%20Jim%C3%A9nez%20Jim%C3%A9nez">Manolo Jiménez</a>. In spite of the personnel issues, Sevilla nonetheless advanced in first place in its Champions League group ahead of <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> before later being eliminated in the round of 16 via penalties to <a href="Fenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K.%20%28football%29">Fenerbahçe</a> of Turkey.
In the summer of 2008, before Jiménez's debut season as first-team manager, <a href="Dani%20Alves">Dani Alves</a> and <a href="Seydou%20Keita">Seydou Keita</a> were both sold to Barcelona, while <a href="Christian%20Poulsen">Christian Poulsen</a> left for <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>. Sevilla finished third in La Liga with a club record-equalling 21 victories and a club record number of away victories.
The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20La%20Liga">2009–10 season</a> saw a third-consecutive qualification to the Champions League. On 19 May 2010, Sevilla defeated Atlético Madrid 2–0 in the <a href="2010%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2010 Copa del Rey Final</a> at <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a>, with goals from <a href="Diego%20Capel">Diego Capel</a> and <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Navas">Jesús Navas</a>. Before the 2010–11 season started, Sevilla lost to Barcelona 5–3 on aggregate in the <a href="2010%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa</a> and were eliminated in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20qualifying%20phase%20and%20play-off%20round">Champions League playoffs</a> by Portuguese club <a href="S.C.%20Braga">Braga</a>.
Unai Emery era.
On 14 January of the following year, after a 0–2 away loss to Valencia that left the Andalusians in 12th place, Jiménez was relieved of his duties, and was replaced by Spanish manager <a href="Unai%20Emery">Unai Emery</a>. The club went through an organizational financial crisis and was forced to sell team stars <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Negredo">Álvaro Negredo</a> and Jesús Navas, transactions that gave the club a combined €40 million; the duo was replaced by a contingent of younger players including strikers <a href="Carlos%20Bacca">Carlos Bacca</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Gameiro">Kevin Gameiro</a>.
On 14 May 2014, Sevilla defeated <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> on penalties in the <a href="2014%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">2014 UEFA Europa League Final</a> to claim their third triumph in the competition. After this season key midfielder <a href="Ivan%20Rakiti%C4%87">Ivan Rakitić</a> was sold to Barcelona for around €16 million (the deal was closed on 16 June 2014). In summer 2015 top scorer Carlos Bacca, who had only joined two years previous, moved to Milan for €30 million. Despite these exits, the club acquired players <a href="Grzegorz%20Krychowiak">Grzegorz Krychowiak</a> and <a href="%C3%89ver%20Banega">Éver Banega</a> to reinforce the squad.
On 27 May 2015, Sevilla were again Europa League champions after defeating Ukrainian club <a href="FC%20Dnipro%20Dnipropetrovsk">Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk</a> 3–2 in the <a href="2015%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">2015 Final</a>. The goals for Sevilla were scored by <a href="Grzegorz%20Krychowiak">Grzegorz Krychowiak</a> and a brace from <a href="Carlos%20Bacca">Carlos Bacca</a>. By defeating Dnipro, they became the only club to have won the Europa League four times.
The club returned to the Europa League final for a third consecutive time, facing <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the <a href="2016%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">2016 Final</a>. After being down 1–0 at half-time, Sevilla bounced back in the second half to eventually win 1–3, with one goal scored from Kevin Gameiro and two from club captain <a href="Coke%20%28footballer%29">Coke</a>. With its third consecutive Europa League title, Sevilla improved its record of most Europa League titles won, having lifted the trophy five times in the span of ten years.
Post-Emery era.
Despite Sevilla's continued success in the Europa League, the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20La%20Liga">2015–16 season</a> proved to be another finish outside the top four, the side finishing in seventh. In response, Castro decided to engineer a resurrection of the club. <a href="Jorge%20Sampaoli">Jorge Sampaoli</a> was hired as manager – replacing <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">Paris Saint-Germain</a>-bound Unai Emery – and the club began to invest heavily that summer. Additions to the side included goalkeeper <a href="Salvatore%20Sirigu">Salvatore Sirigu</a> on loan, playmaker <a href="Paulo%20Henrique%20Ganso">Ganso</a>, forwards <a href="Luciano%20Vietto">Luciano Vietto</a> and <a href="Wissam%20Ben%20Yedder">Wissam Ben Yedder</a>, attacker <a href="Franco%20V%C3%A1zquez">Franco Vázquez</a>, wide midfielders <a href="Hiroshi%20Kiyotake">Hiroshi Kiyotake</a> and <a href="Pablo%20Sarabia">Pablo Sarabia</a>, as well as former <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> player <a href="Samir%20Nasri">Samir Nasri</a> on loan. 
In December of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20La%20Liga">2017–18 La Liga</a>, <a href="Vincenzo%20Montella">Vincenzo Montella</a> was named as the third manager since Emery's departure in 2016 replacing Eduardo Berizzo. In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2017–18 UEFA Champions League</a> season, Sevilla progressed into the knockout stages of the competition, and defeated <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a> in the Round of 16, reaching the round of 8 for the first time in 60 years, where they ultimately lost to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> 2–1 on aggregate.
On 4 June 2019, Sevilla announced the signing of <a href="Julen%20Lopetegui">Julen Lopetegui</a> as manager for the next three seasons. On 16 August 2020, Sevilla won 2–1 over <a href="Manchester%20United">Manchester United</a> in the semi-finals of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2019–20 UEFA Europa League</a>, en route to lifting the trophy for a record sixth time, beating <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> 3–2 in the <a href="2020%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">final</a>. 
On 31 May 2023, Sevilla clinched their record-extending <a href="2023%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20final">7th Europa League title</a> with a win over <a href="A.S.%20Roma">Roma</a>, drawing 1–1 after extra time and beating them 4–1 on penalties.
Board and finances.
Presidency.
Sevilla is governed by a presidential management system, but with a board of directors that discusses and approves those important decisions that must be carried out. The president is supported by a general director sometimes and a sports director.
Throughout its history, Sevilla has had 28 presidents, the first being <a href="Edward%20Farquharson%20Johnston">Edward Farquharson Johnston</a>, a Scotsman. Those who have occupied the presidency for the longest periods have been Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, Eugenio Montes Cabezas, José María del Nido Benavente, Luis Cuervas Vilches and José Castro Carmona.
In 1992, Sevilla FC became a Sporting Limited Association, following the entry into force of the law that regulated this kind of sporting companies, and therefore the system of election of the president was amended from being elected by the members to be elected by the shareholders of the club.
Symbols.
Anthems.
Sevilla has two official anthems:
Crest.
From its foundation, the team used a double-circled crest. On the exterior circle, the name of the club and the date of its foundation were written, while in the interior circle on a white background the letters "SFC" were interlaced as they are on the current crest. This first crest was designed by Juan Lafita, who was a close associate of the club and was the son of the Sevillian painter José Lafita y Blanco.
The second crest was designed in 1922 by Pablo Rodríguez Blanco, a draftsman of the Water Company. He divided the shield in three parts and together they formed the silhouette of a heart. The three figures that appear are the Christian saints portrayed on the coat of arms of the city—<a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>, <a href="Ferdinand%20III%20of%20Castile">Ferdinand III of Castile</a> and <a href="Leander%20of%20Seville">Leander of Seville</a>. On the right side appear the initials "SFC," which were on the official shield from 1905 to 1922. 
Where the three parts meet, a football of the era appears. Regarding the red and white stripes, there are various theories, but it seems that the most coherent is that from the first time, the club wished that the official kit would be red and white. Another version indicates that the lower part is inspired on the flag which King <a href="Ferdinand%20III%20of%20Castile">Ferdinand III of Castile</a> carried in the reconquest of Seville in 1248.
Flag.
The definition of Sevilla's flag is in the articles of association of 1982, which is a modification of the old ones which were formed and deposited in the Record of Associations and Sports Federations of the Higher Council of Sports. Its title 1, article 6 states that this is a distinctive emblem of the club:
The flag, which will be rectangular, divided by a diagonal line that goes from the lower left angle to the upper right angle, which divides it into two triangles, the superior is white and the inferior red.
Kit.
Sevilla wore shirts with a sponsor logo for the first time in the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20La%20Liga">1986–87 season</a>, to promote the <a href="Seville%20Expo%20%2792">Seville Expo '92</a>. Previously, before the 1980–81 season, the club signed its first kit-manufacturer deal with the German firm <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>. Since 2022 the kit is manufactured by <a href="Castore%20%28brand%29">Castore</a>.
Media.
Sevilla have several media outlets. Its radio station, "SFC Radio", launched in September 2004, broadcasts all day on FM and online, while its television channel SFC TV aired for the first time in the 2005–06 season with a UEFA Cup match against <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">Zenit Saint Petersburg</a>. Since 8 June 2009, the television coverage has been shown on the club website. Sevilla issue a physical and digital newspaper the day after every match and on the same day as an important one, as well as a magazine before home games. The official magazine of the club is released every two months, the first issue being free and issued at a friendly against the <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil national team</a> to mark the club's centennial in September 2005.

Stadium.
In their first fifty years Sevilla played their home matches in various locations around Seville: la Trinidad Field, the Mercantile Field, 'La Victoria' Stadium and the <a href="Estadio%20de%20Nervi%C3%B3n">Estadio de Nervión</a>.
The <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Pizju%C3%A1n%20Stadium">Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium</a> was first planned in 1937 when the land was bought near to the then-home of Sevilla, in <a href="Nervi%C3%B3n%2C%20Seville">Nervión</a>, and construction began in 1954. A contest was held for its design, won by the architect Manuel Muñoz Monasterio, who had also designed the home of Real Madrid, the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a>.
The construction of the stadium was completed in the summer of 1958 and was inaugurated on 7 September of the same year with a friendly match against <a href="Real%20Ja%C3%A9n">Real Jaén</a>. The east and west grandstands to the stadium were finished in 1974 under the presidency of Eugenio Montes Cabezas and increased the stadium's capacity to 70,000. The visor, the mosaic on the main façade (by Santiago del Campo) and the new lighting were added for the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 FIFA World Cup</a>, in which it held a group game between the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team">Soviet Union</a> and <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a>, as well as a semi-final between <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> and <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a>. 
The <a href="1986%20European%20Cup%20Final">1986 European Cup Final</a> was held in the stadium, and won by <a href="FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti">Steaua București</a> against Barcelona. The capacity of the stadium was reduced to approximately 60,000. The last modification was made during the mid-1990s, when according to <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> rules, all standing areas were redeveloped into seating, reducing the capacity to the present 42,714.
The <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spain national team</a> have played 26 matches in the stadium since 1961, unbeaten with 21 wins and 5 draws. To mark the club's centenary in 2005, an allegorical mosaic designed by Ben Yessef was built above the southern gate, depicting the history of the city of Seville. Above it, the club's badge floated in the wind. The stadium currently houses the headquarters of the club's media, as well as an official store, club museum and trophy cabinet.
Training facilities.
The sporting facilities known as La Ciudad Deportiva (The Sporting City) are used by the first team for training and by the reserve teams and women for matches. These facilities were inaugurated in 1974 and are located on the outskirts of the city on the road to <a href="Utrera">Utrera</a>. It has four natural grass pitches and three artificial pitches, as well as an artificial pitch for the Antonio Puerta Football School, changing rooms, gymnasium, press room, cafeteria, medical center and a recovering room.
League record.
Season to season.
Since the club was first promoted to La Liga in the 1934–35 season, Sevilla has played all but thirteen seasons in the first division. Sevilla won La Liga in the 1945–46 season, and finished as runners-up four times (1939–40, 1942–43, 1950–51 and 1956–57). While the club has only suffered four short-lived descents to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, it won the second division title in 1968–69 and 2000–01.

The official Madrid anthem is the "<a href="Hala%20Madrid%20y%20nada%20m%C3%A1s">Hala Madrid y nada más</a>", written by <a href="RedOne">RedOne</a> and Manuel Jabois.

Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have <a href="List%20of%20unrelegated%20association%20football%20clubs">never been relegated</a> from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably "<a href="El%20Cl%C3%A1sico">El Clásico</a>" with Barcelona and "<a href="Madrid%20Derby">El Derbi Madrileño</a>" with <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Cups</a> and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a>, <a href="Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s">Ferenc Puskás</a>, <a href="Paco%20Gento">Paco Gento</a> and <a href="Raymond%20Kopa">Raymond Kopa</a> is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time. Real Madrid is known for its "<a href="Gal%C3%A1cticos">Galácticos</a>" policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="Zidane">Zidane</a> and <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a> to create a superstar team. The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of <a href="Florentino%20P%C3%A9rez">Florentino Pérez</a>'s presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018), however, <a href="Gal%C3%A1cticos%23First%20gal%C3%A1ctico%20era">players</a> brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the "Galácticos" legacy. A notable example is <a href="Steve%20McManaman">Steve McManaman</a>, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy. On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed <a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> for a record breaking £80 million (€94 million); he became both the club and history's all-time top goalscorer. Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as <a href="Vin%C3%ADcius%20J%C3%BAnior">Vinícius Júnior</a>, <a href="Rodrygo">Rodrygo</a> and <a href="Jude%20Bellingham">Jude Bellingham</a>.

History.
Early years (1902–1943).
Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the "<a href="Instituci%C3%B3n%20Libre%20de%20Ense%C3%B1anza">Institución Libre de Enseñanza</a>", which included several <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> University graduates. They founded "(Sociedad) Sky Football" in 1897, commonly known as "La Sociedad" (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, "Nueva Sociedad de Football" (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from "Sky Football". Among the dissenters were <a href="Juli%C3%A1n%20Palacios">Julián Palacios</a>, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, <a href="Juan%20Padr%C3%B3s">Juan Padrós</a> and <a href="Carlos%20Padr%C3%B3s">Carlos Padrós</a>, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, "Sky" was renamed as "<a href="New%20Foot-Ball%20Club">New Foot-Ball Club</a>". On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded. The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of "Al Capricho", the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a> a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honor of a famous English team <a href="Corinthian%20F.C.">Corinthian</a>, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.
Three years after its founding, in <a href="1905%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1905</a>, "Madrid FC" won its first title after defeating <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Spanish Cup</a> final. The club became one of the founding sides of the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Royal Spanish Football Federation</a> on 4 January 1909, when club president <a href="Adolfo%20Mel%C3%A9ndez">Adolfo Meléndez</a> signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the "<a href="Campo%20de%20O%27Donnell">Campo de O'Donnell</a>" in 1912. In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after <a href="Alfonso%20XIII">King Alfonso XIII</a> granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.
In <a href="1929%20La%20Liga">1929</a>, the first <a href="La%20Liga">Spanish football league</a> was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona. Real Madrid won its first league title in the <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20La%20Liga">1931–32 season</a> and retained it <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20La%20Liga">the following year</a>.
On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a> caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, <a href="Real%20Madrid%20v%20FC%20Barcelona%20%281943%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%29">Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1</a> in the second leg of the <a href="1943%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%23Semi-finals">Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals</a>, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honor of <a href="Francisco%20Franco">General Franco</a>. The first leg, played at the <a href="Camp%20de%20Les%20Corts">Les Corts</a> in Catalonia, had ended with <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona, with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper "<a href="Ya%20%28newspaper%29">Ya</a>" reported the whistling as a "clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain." Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker <a href="Mariano%20Gonzalvo">Mariano Gonzalvo</a> said of the incident, "Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins." Barcelona goalkeeper <a href="Luis%20Mir%C3%B3">Luis Miró</a> rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As <a href="Francisco%20Calvet">Francisco Calvet</a> told the story, "They were shouting: "Reds! Separatists!"... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up."
Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a "completely normal tackle". Madrid's <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Llopis%20Corona">José Llopis Corona</a> recalled: "At which point, they got a bit demoralized," while Ángel Mur countered, "at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'." Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal. According to football writer <a href="Sid%20Lowe">Sid Lowe</a>, "There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims." Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: "There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game."
Santiago Bernabéu and unprecedented success (1943–1978).
<a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20%28footballer%29">Santiago Bernabéu</a> became president of Real Madrid in 1943. Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol</a> (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities <a href="Ciudad%20Deportiva%2C%20Madrid">Ciudad Deportiva</a>. Additionally, during the 1950s former "Real Madrid Amateurs" player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or ""<a href="cantera">cantera</a>"," known today as <a href="La%20F%C3%A1brica%20%28Real%20Madrid%29">La Fábrica</a>. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a>.
In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by <a href="Gabriel%20Hanot">Gabriel Hanot</a>, a French sports journalist and editor of "<a href="L%27%C3%89quipe">L'Équipe</a>", Bernabéu, Bedrignan and <a href="Guszt%C3%A1v%20Sebes">Gusztáv Sebes</a> created the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park <a href="1960%20European%20Cup%20Final">final</a> against <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a> in <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20European%20Cup">1960</a>. After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup%23Multiple-winner%20badge">UEFA badge of honor</a>. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">1953–54</a> to <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">1968–69</a>, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.
The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20European%20Cup">1966</a>, defeating <a href="FK%20Partizan">Partizan Belgrade</a> 2–1 in the <a href="1966%20European%20Cup%20Final">final</a> with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition. This team became known as the <a href="Y%C3%A9-y%C3%A9%20%28Real%20Madrid%29">Yé-yé</a>. The name "Yé-yé" came from the "Yeah, yeah, yeah" chorus in <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' song "<a href="She%20Loves%20You">She Loves You</a>" after four members of the team posed for "<a href="Marca%20%28newspaper%29">Marca</a>" and impersonated the Beatles. The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in <a href="1962%20European%20Cup%20Final">1962</a> and <a href="1964%20European%20Cup%20Final">1964</a>. In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups. The club competed in its first <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1970–71</a> and progressed all the way to the <a href="1971%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, where it lost to English side <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> 2–1 in a replay. On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> was being played in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> decreed three days of mourning to honor him during the tournament. The following year, the club organized the first edition of the <a href="Trofeo%20Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u">Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu</a> in memory of its former president.
Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a>, six <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cups</a>, 16 <a href="List%20of%20Spanish%20football%20champions">league titles</a>, six <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Spanish Cups</a>, two <a href="Latin%20Cup">Latin Cup</a>s and one <a href="Copa%20Eva%20Duarte">Copa Eva Duarte</a>.
Quinta del Buitre and sustained success (1980–2000).
In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought <a href="Football%20in%20Spain">domestic</a> success back to the club. Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name "<a href="Quinta%20del%20Buitre">La Quinta del Buitre</a>" ("Vulture's Cohort"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, <a href="Emilio%20Butrague%C3%B1o">Emilio Butragueño</a>. The other four members were <a href="Manolo%20Sanch%C3%ADs">Manolo Sanchís</a>, <a href="Rafael%20Mart%C3%ADn%20V%C3%A1zquez">Martín Vázquez</a>, <a href="M%C3%ADchel%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201963%29">Míchel</a> and <a href="Miguel%20Pardeza">Miguel Pardeza</a>. All five footballers were graduates of <a href="La%20F%C3%A1brica%20%28Real%20Madrid%29">Real Madrid's youth academy</a>. With "La Quinta del Buitre" (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a> in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper <a href="Francisco%20Buyo">Francisco Buyo</a>, right-back Miguel Porlán "<a href="Chendo">Chendo</a>" and Mexican striker <a href="Hugo%20S%C3%A1nchez">Hugo Sánchez</a>, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cups</a>, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three <a href="Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Spanish Super Cups</a>. In the early 1990s, "La Quinta del Buitre" split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.
In 1996, President <a href="Lorenzo%20Sanz">Lorenzo Sanz</a> appointed <a href="Fabio%20Capello">Fabio Capello</a> as coach. Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like <a href="Predrag%20Mijatovi%C4%87">Predrag Mijatović</a>, <a href="Davor%20%C5%A0uker">Davor Šuker</a>, <a href="Clarence%20Seedorf">Clarence Seedorf</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Carlos">Roberto Carlos</a> and keeper <a href="Bodo%20Illgner">Bodo Illgner</a>, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20%28footballer%29">Raúl</a>, <a href="Fernando%20Hierro">Fernando Hierro</a> and <a href="Fernando%20Redondo">Fernando Redondo</a>. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of <a href="Fernando%20Morientes">Fernando Morientes</a> in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a>, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the <a href="1998%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a> with a goal from Mijatović.
In November 1999, <a href="Vicente%20del%20Bosque">Vicente del Bosque</a> took over as coach. For the last season of the century, <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">1999–2000</a>, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of <a href="Guti%20%28Spanish%20footballer%29">Guti</a> and <a href="Iker%20Casillas">Iker Casillas</a>, supported by the arrival of <a href="Steve%20McManaman">Steve McManaman</a> and <a href="Nicolas%20Anelka">Nicolas Anelka</a> from the English Premier League, alongside local talents <a href="M%C3%ADchel%20Salgado">Míchel Salgado</a> and <a href="Iv%C3%A1n%20Helguera">Iván Helguera</a>. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">eighth time</a>, following a 3–0 victory over <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> in the <a href="2000%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a>, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl. This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.
Florentino Pérez era (2000–2006).
In July 2000, <a href="Florentino%20P%C3%A9rez">Florentino Pérez</a> was elected club president. He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Figo">Luís Figo</a> from arch-rivals Barcelona. The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the "<a href="Gal%C3%A1cticos">Galácticos</a>" team by signing a global star every summer, which included <a href="Zinedine%20Zidane">Zinedine Zidane</a>, <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Figo">Luís Figo</a>, <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a> and <a href="Fabio%20Cannavaro">Fabio Cannavaro</a>. It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> and an <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> in <a href="2002%20Intercontinental%20Cup">2002</a>, followed by <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the "Zidanes y Pavones" policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.
The few days after the capturing of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20La%20Liga">2003 La Liga title</a> were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach <a href="Vicente%20del%20Bosque">Vicente del Bosque</a>. Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder <a href="Claude%20Mak%C3%A9l%C3%A9l%C3%A9">Claude Makélélé</a> refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. "That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team," stated Zidane. Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach <a href="Carlos%20Queiroz">Carlos Queiroz</a>, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a>.
The <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2005–06 season</a> began with the promise of several new signings: <a href="J%C3%BAlio%20Baptista">Júlio Baptista</a> (€24 million), <a href="Robinho">Robinho</a> (€30 million), and <a href="Sergio%20Ramos">Sergio Ramos</a> (€27 million). However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005. Madrid's coach <a href="Vanderlei%20Luxemburgo">Wanderley Luxemburgo</a> was sacked the following month and his replacement was <a href="Juan%20Ram%C3%B3n%20L%C3%B3pez%20Caro">Juan Ramón López Caro</a>. A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza, a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.
Ramón Calderón era (2006–2009).
<a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Calder%C3%B3n">Ramón Calderón</a> was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and <a href="Predrag%20Mijatovi%C4%87">Predrag Mijatović</a> as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">2007</a> for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign. The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">Mallorca</a> at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, the other title challengers, faced <a href="Gimn%C3%A0stic%20de%20Tarragona">Gimnàstic de Tarragona</a> and <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a>, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in <a href="Nou%20Estadi%20de%20Tarragona">Tarragona</a>. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003. Real Madrid repeated as league winners in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">2007–08</a>, but the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">following season</a> ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">league title</a> for Barça that went on to win the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29%23Continental%20trebles">treble</a>.
Second Florentino Pérez era (2009–present).
On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline. Pérez continued with the "Galácticos" policy pursued in his first term, buying <a href="Kak%C3%A1">Kaká</a> from <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> for a <a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20association%20football%20transfers">record-breaking</a> (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million, and then breaking the record again by purchasing <a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> from <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> for £80 million. Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the "Second Galácticos". The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2009–10 season</a>, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20La%20Liga">league</a>, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> at the hands of <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a>. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks, although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Premier%20League">2018–19</a>.
<a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a> took over as manager in May 2010. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2010–11 season</a>, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">Barcelona</a> side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20La%20Liga">league</a>, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the <a href="2011%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey final</a>, and lost to Barça in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Semi-finals">Champions League semi-finals</a>, where Real progressed to for the first time since <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2002–03</a>. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four "<a href="El%20Cl%C3%A1sico">Clásicos</a>" were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football">a.e.t.</a>, bringing them their first trophy in the second "Galáctico" era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw). Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the <a href="European%20Golden%20Shoe">European Golden Shoe</a>.
In the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2011–12 season</a>, Real Madrid won <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous <a href="La%20Liga%20records%20and%20statistics">league records</a> set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall. They also competed in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the 15th successive season, losing in the semi-finals to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a> after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> as the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Copa%20del%20Rey">defending champions</a>, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend <a href="Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s">Ferenc Puskás</a>, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.
Real Madrid started the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2012–13 season</a> by winning the <a href="2012%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a>, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the <a href="2013%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">final</a>, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> 1–2 <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football">a.e.t.</a> Real Madrid faced the "Blaugrana" six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of <a href="Luka%20Modri%C4%87">Luka Modrić</a> from <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> for a fee in the region of £33 million. After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by "mutual agreement".
"La Décima" and Champions League dominance.
On 25 June 2013, <a href="Carlo%20Ancelotti">Carlo Ancelotti</a> succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants. On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of <a href="Gareth%20Bale">Gareth Bale</a> from <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. In Ancelotti's <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">first season at the club</a>, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">league campaign</a> on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and three behind cross-city rivals <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals. By that time, "Los Blancos" had already secured the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner. The major breakthrough came in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, where Real returned to the <a href="2014%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a> after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals. In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football">a.e.t.</a> to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as "La Décima" (Spanish: "The Tenth," ). Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.
After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper <a href="Keylor%20Navas">Keylor Navas</a>, midfielder <a href="Toni%20Kroos">Toni Kroos</a> and attacking midfielder <a href="James%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">James Rodríguez</a>. In August, Madrid won the <a href="2014%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2014 UEFA Super Cup</a> against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy. During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: <a href="Xabi%20Alonso">Xabi Alonso</a> to Bayern Munich and <a href="%C3%81ngel%20Di%20Mar%C3%ADa">Ángel Di María</a> to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, "If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently," while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, "We must start again from zero."
After a slow start to the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2014–15 season</a>, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by <a href="Frank%20Rijkaard">Frank Rijkaard</a>'s Barça in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2005–06 season</a>. In late December, Real Madrid won their first <a href="2014%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">Club World Cup</a>, defeating <a href="San%20Lorenzo%20de%20Almagro">San Lorenzo</a> 2–0 in the <a href="2014%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a>. The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins. Madrid was in contention for both the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> title and the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to <a href="Juventus%20FC">Juventus</a> 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals. Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012. Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals, several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.
On 3 June 2015, <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a> was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2015–16 season</a>, signing a three-year contract. Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20La%20Liga">league</a> until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first "Clásico" of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> (6–0 vs <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">Espanyol</a>, 8–0 vs <a href="Malm%C3%B6%20FF">Malmö</a>, 10–2 vs <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a> and others). In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Copa%20del%20Rey%23Round%20of%2032">Copa del Rey round of 32</a>, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at <a href="C%C3%A1diz%20CF">Cádiz</a> and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez. In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage%23Group%20A">UCL group</a> with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams. Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role. Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favor, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against <a href="VfL%20Wolfsburg">Wolfsburg</a> in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process. Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the <a href="2016%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a>, with the achievement being termed "La Undécima".
Real Madrid began their <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2016–17 campaign</a>, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the <a href="2016%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2016 UEFA Super Cup</a> against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit <a href="Kashima%20Antlers">Kashima Antlers</a> 4–2 in the <a href="2016%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a> of the <a href="2016%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">2016 FIFA Club World Cup</a>. With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">previous season</a>. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by <a href="RC%20Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta Vigo</a> 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> in the <a href="2017%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">Champions League final</a> resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20European%20Cup">1989</a> and <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20European%20Cup">1990</a>, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as "La Duodécima". The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2017–18 season</a>.
Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> in a <a href="2017%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2–1 victory</a> against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> 3–1 in the first leg of the <a href="2017%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">2017 Supercopa de España</a> and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in <a href="List%20of%20El%20Cl%C3%A1sico%20matches">"El Clásico" matches</a> and winning the second trophy of the season. On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club <a href="Gr%C3%AAmio%20Foot-Ball%20Porto%20Alegrense">Grêmio</a> 1–0 in the <a href="2017%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a> <a href="2017%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a> and became the first team to retain the trophy. In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2017–18 UEFA Champions League</a>, Madrid once again progressed to the <a href="2018%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a> where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20European%20Cup">1976</a>. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's "need for change" as his rationale for departing. Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the "Second Galáctico Era" that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the "Blaugrana" boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history, and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage. Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.
Following Ronaldo's departure.
On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named <a href="Julen%20Lopetegui">Julen Lopetegui</a>, the head coach of the <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spanish national team</a>, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 FIFA World Cup</a>. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them. The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million. Madrid began their <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2018–19 campaign</a> by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football">a.e.t.</a> in the <a href="2018%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2018 UEFA Super Cup</a>. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in "El Clásico" on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then <a href="Real%20Madrid%20Castilla">Castilla</a> coach, <a href="Santiago%20Solari">Santiago Solari</a>. On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat <a href="Al%20Ain%20FC">Al Ain</a> 4–1 in the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a> and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles. However, they were then knocked out of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club. Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20La%20Liga">2001–02</a> and <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20La%20Liga">1999–2000</a> respectively.
In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed <a href="Eden%20Hazard">Eden Hazard</a>, <a href="Luka%20Jovi%C4%87">Luka Jović</a>, <a href="%C3%89der%20Milit%C3%A3o">Éder Militão</a>, <a href="Ferland%20Mendy">Ferland Mendy</a>, <a href="Rodrygo">Rodrygo</a>, <a href="Reinier%20Jesus%20Carvalho">Reinier</a> and other players for a total of more than €350 million. On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the <a href="2020%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a%20Final">Supercopa de España final</a> to win their eleventh title. After a three-month hiatus due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Spain">COVID-19 outbreak</a> in March 2020, <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total. From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2020–21 season</a>, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano%20Stadium">Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium</a>, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.
Further domestic success and "La Decimocuarta".
Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">that season</a>, with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2021–22 season</a>. On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> and the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a>. As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid. In the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time, defeating pre-tournament favorites <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">defending champions</a> and favorites <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Premier%20League">Premier League champions</a> and heavy favorites <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, all in dramatic fashion, and setting up the <a href="2022%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a> against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favorites, in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone <a href="Vin%C3%ADcius%20J%C3%BAnior">Vinícius</a> goal sealed the 14th European Cup for "Los Blancos", their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge. Real also claimed their fourth ever <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23European%20double">European double</a> (after <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">1956–57</a>, <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">1957–58</a>, and <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2016–17</a>). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favored to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.
Crests and colours.
Crests.
The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, "MCF" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.
The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle. The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of <a href="Pedro%20Parages">Pedro Parages</a> in 1920. At that time, <a href="Alfonso%20XIII">King Alfonso XIII</a> granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title "Real Madrid," meaning "Royal." Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol".
With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile. In 1941, two years after <a href="Nationalist%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Nationalist</a> victory in the Civil War, the <a href="Francoist%20Spain">Francoist regime</a> restored the crest's "Real Corona", or "Royal Crown", while the mulberry stripe of <a href="Castile%20%28historical%20region%29">Castile</a> was retained as well. In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol". The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.
Colours.
Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by <a href="Juan%20Padr%C3%B3s">Juan Padrós</a> in honor of an English team <a href="Corinthian%20F.C.">Corinthian</a>, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the <a href="1926%20Copa%20del%20Rey">cup</a> by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.
Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>, whose contract extends from 1998. Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, <a href="Zanussi">Zanussi</a>, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by <a href="Parmalat">Parmalat</a> and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with <a href="Teka">Teka</a> in 1992. In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with <a href="Siemens%20AG">Siemens</a> and in 2006, the <a href="BenQ%20Siemens">BenQ Siemens</a> logo appeared on the club's shirt. Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was <a href="bwin.com">bwin.com</a> following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens. Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year. In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026. In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>.
Kit deal.
"Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance."
Grounds.
After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the <a href="Campo%20de%20O%27Donnell">Campo de O'Donnell</a> in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years. After this period, the club moved for one year to the <a href="Campo%20de%20Ciudad%20Lineal">Campo de Ciudad Lineal</a>, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the <a href="Estadio%20Chamart%C3%ADn">Estadio Chamartín</a>, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title. Following his election in 1943, president <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20%28footballer%29">Santiago Bernabéu</a> decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">new stadium</a> was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947. Initially knows as "Nuevo Chamartín", the stadium was renamed in honor of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day. The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club <a href="C.F.%20Os%20Belenenses">Belenenses</a>, with "Los Blancos" winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.
The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion. Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions. The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.
The Bernabéu has hosted the <a href="1964%20European%20Nations%27%20Cup%20Final">1964 UEFA European Championship final</a>, the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">1982 FIFA World Cup final</a>, and the <a href="1957%20European%20Cup%20Final">1957</a>, <a href="1969%20European%20Cup%20Final">1969</a>, <a href="1980%20European%20Cup%20Final">1980</a> and <a href="2010%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2010</a> European Cup/Champions League finals. The stadium has its own namesake <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20%28Madrid%20Metro%29">Madrid Metro station</a> along the 10 line. On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to <a href="UEFA%20stadium%20categories">Elite Football Stadium</a> status by UEFA.
On 9 May 2006, the <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano%20Stadium">Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium</a>, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and <a href="Stade%20de%20Reims">Reims</a>, a rematch of the <a href="1956%20European%20Cup%20Final">1956 European Cup final</a>. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from <a href="Sergio%20Ramos">Sergio Ramos</a>, <a href="Antonio%20Cassano">Antonio Cassano</a> (2), <a href="Roberto%20Soldado">Roberto Soldado</a> (2) and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Jurado">José Manuel Jurado</a>. The venue is now part of the <a href="Ciudad%20Real%20Madrid">Ciudad Real Madrid</a>, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is <a href="Real%20Madrid%20Castilla">Real Madrid Castilla</a>'s home ground. For the latter part of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2019–20 season</a> and throughout the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2020–21 season</a>, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Spain">COVID-19 pandemic</a>-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.
The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to just over the 85,000 mark. Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed. The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a> and <a href="2022%20Russian%20invasion%20of%20Ukraine">Russian invasion of Ukraine</a> caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.
Records and statistics.
<a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20%28footballer%29">Raúl</a> holds the record for most Real Madrid appearances, having played 741 first-team matches from 1994 to 2010. <a href="Iker%20Casillas">Iker Casillas</a> comes second with 725 appearances, followed by <a href="Manuel%20Sanchis%20Hontiyuelo">Manuel Sanchis Jr.</a>, having played 710 times.

Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches. Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a> (1953–1964), <a href="Santillana%20%28footballer%29">Santillana</a> (1971–1988), <a href="Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s">Ferenc Puskás</a> (1958–1966), <a href="Hugo%20S%C3%A1nchez">Hugo Sánchez</a> (1985–1992), <a href="Karim%20Benzema">Karim Benzema</a> (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in <a href="La%20Liga%23Most%20goals">La Liga history with 311 goals</a>. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean <a href="Iv%C3%A1n%20Zamorano">Iván Zamorano</a> on 3 September 1994 during a league match against <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>.
Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 83,329, which was for a Copa del Rey match in 2006. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 81,044. The club's average attendance in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2007–08 season</a> was 76,234, the highest in <a href="List%20of%20association%20football%20competitions%23UEFA%20%28European%20competitions%29">European leagues</a>. Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (35 as of 2021–22) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90). With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.
The club also holds the record for winning the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup/UEFA Champions League</a> fourteen times and for the <a href="European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20records%20and%20statistics%23By%20semi-final%20appearances">most semi-finals appearances</a> (32). As of June 2023, Cristiano Ronaldo is the <a href="List%20of%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20top%20scorers">all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League</a>, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of <a href="European%20Cup%20and%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20records%20and%20statistics%23Consecutive%20appearances">consecutive participations in the European Cup</a> (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70. Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20season">2014–15 season</a>, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide. The same season, the team tied the record winning streak in the Champions League, with ten games. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club <a href="Santos%20FC">Santos</a>, starring <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a>, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game.
In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the <a href="Transfer%20%28association%20football%29%23Highest%20fees">highest transfer fee</a> ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (<a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>80 million). The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy <a href="Kak%C3%A1">Kaká</a> from <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>'s <a href="Gareth%20Bale">Gareth Bale</a> in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million. In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418. Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed <a href="Eden%20Hazard">Eden Hazard</a> from <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> for a reported €115 million. The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.
Support.
During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000. To become a season ticket holder one must first be a "socio", or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 "peñas" (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Bernabéu</a>. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.
Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called "Ultras Sur" supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme <a href="right-wing%20politics">right-wing politics</a>, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group <a href="Boixos%20Nois">Boixos Nois</a>. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a> "<a href="S.S.%20Lazio%20fans">Irriducibili</a>" fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so. <a href="Florentino%20P%C3%A9rez">Florentino Pérez</a> took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result. The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.

Rivalries.
El Clásico.
There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> is known as "The Classic" ("El Clásico"). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: <a href="Castile%20%28historical%20region%29">Castile</a> and <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the <a href="Castilians">Castilians</a> and <a href="Catalan%20people">Catalans</a>, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.
As early as the 1930s, Barcelona "had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid". During the dictatorships of <a href="Miguel%20Primo%20de%20Rivera">Miguel Primo de Rivera</a> and especially <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to <a href="Francoist%20Spain">Franco's regime</a>. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto "Més que un club" ("English: More than a club") because of its alleged connection to <a href="Catalan%20nationalism">Catalan nationalist</a> as well as to <a href="progressivism">progressive</a> beliefs.
There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Aviación</a> and Madrid FC (that recovered its "royal" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as "Spanish team", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Generalísimo</a> titles and a <a href="Copa%20Eva%20Duarte">Copa Eva Duarte</a>; Barcelona claimed three <a href="List%20of%20Spanish%20football%20champions">league titles</a>, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's <a href="%23Early%20years%20%281902%E2%80%931943%29">11–1 home win against Barcelona</a> in the <a href="1943%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo">Copa del Generalísimo</a>, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a> to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20%28footballer%29">Santiago Bernabéu</a>'s "revolution" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for <a href="Nationalist%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Franco's forces</a>, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s. These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. <a href="Fernando%20Maria%20Castiella">Fernando Maria Castiella</a>, who served as <a href="Minister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Spain%29">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that "[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had". Franco died in 1975, and the <a href="Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy">Spanish transition to democracy</a> soon followed. Under his rule, <a href="List%20of%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20records%20and%20statistics%23Honours">Real Madrid had won</a> 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two <a href="Latin%20Cup">Latin Cup</a>s and one <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a>. In the same period, <a href="List%20of%20FC%20Barcelona%20records%20and%20statistics%23Honours">Barcelona had won</a> eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>s and two Latin Cups.
The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a>. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for <a href="Club%20Deportivo%20Los%20Millonarios">Los Millionarios</a> in <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, during a players' strike in his native <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to "Los Blancos", signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.
Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>. The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20European%20Cup">1959–60</a> and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup">1960–61</a>. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a> arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>. Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son <a href="Jordi%20Cruyff">"Jordi"</a>, after the local Catalan <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a>. In 2002, the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20stage%23Semi-finals">European encounter</a> between the clubs was dubbed the "Match of The Century" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world. A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured <a href="Goal%20celebration">memorable goal celebrations</a> from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition. In October 1999, Real Madrid forward <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20%28footballer%29">Raúl</a> silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet. In 2009, Barcelona captain <a href="Carles%20Puyol">Carles Puyol</a> kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu. Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to "calm down" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016. In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them. Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the <a href="2017%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a>, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.
El Derbi madrileño.
The club's nearest neighbour is <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of "Madrid FC". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the <a href="Campeonato%20Regional%20Centro%231906%E2%80%9307">regional championship</a>, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first <a href="1929%20La%20Liga">league championship</a> at the former <a href="Estadio%20Chamart%C3%ADn">Chamartín</a>. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1. After the Civil War, during the early <a href="Francoist%20Spain">Francoist period</a>, Atlético became associated with the <a href="Spanish%20Air%20Force">military air force</a> (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, "Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had." Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were "El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país" – "The team of the government, the shame of the country" – and allegedly adopted a more <a href="left-wing%20politics">left-wing slant</a> (tempered by the rise of <a href="ultras">ultras</a> culture and <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a>'s presence as the "true" leftist club in Madrid).
The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a> when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu</a>, while Atlético won 1–0 at the <a href="Estadio%20Metropolitano%20de%20Madrid">Metropolitano</a>. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Villalonga%20Llorente">José Villalonga</a>, it defeated its city rivals in two successive <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Generalísimo</a> finals in <a href="1960%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1960</a> and <a href="1961%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1961</a>. In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters "Indios" (<a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indians</a>, a reference to the <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>n players signed by the Red-and-whites). It is worth noting that by then, Real Madrid was not very keen on signing non-<a href="Caucasian%20race">Caucasian</a> players (president <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20%28footballer%29">Santiago Bernabéu</a> even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star <a href="Eusebio">Eusebio</a> at the end of the 1960s, "Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote" ("As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here"). Atlético's supporters accepted the new "Indian" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the <a href="bourgeoisie">upper class</a> <a href="Paseo%20de%20la%20Castellana">Paseo de la Castellana</a> street, while the <a href="Vicente%20Calder%C3%B3n%20Stadium">Vicente Calderón</a> (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20season">2016–17 season</a>) could be found near a brewery, alongside the <a href="Manzanares%20%28river%29">Manzanares River</a> and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively <a href="working%20class">working class</a> fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city. In fact, the Atlético crest includes the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Madrid">Coat of arms of Madrid</a>, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader <a href="Castile%20%28historical%20region%29">Castile region</a>).
Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favorable. A high point came in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20La%20Liga">2002–03 season</a>, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the <a href="2013%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey final</a> in May 2013. In <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2013–14</a>, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a <a href="2014%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">4–1</a> comeback victory in extra time. On <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20La%20Liga">7 February 2015</a>, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss. On <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">28 May 2016</a>, Real and Atlético again met for the <a href="2016%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">Champions League title</a>, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a>.
El Viejo Clásico.
A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>. This is known as <a href="El%20Viejo%20Cl%C3%A1sico">El Viejo Clásico</a> ("the old classic"), so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in <a href="1903%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1903</a>. Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of <a href="Football%20in%20Spain">Spanish football</a>, when it was surpassed by "El Clásico".
Athletic Bilbao, who operate a <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao%20signing%20policy">policy of only using local players</a>, have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the "Lions" have collected no major trophies since 1984 and won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20La%20Liga">2005–06</a> to <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20La%20Liga">2016–17</a>. However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque region</a>.
European rivalries.
Bayern Munich.
Real Madrid and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning fourteen times and Bayern winning six times. Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws), with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings. Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the "Bestia negra" ("Black Beast").
During the 2010s, the two teams met in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Semi-finals">2011–12 Champions League semi-finals</a>, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost <a href="2012%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">the final</a> at their own stadium), and then at the same stage in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Semi-finals">2013–14 edition</a> with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate on their way to winning the competition. They were also drawn together in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Quarter-finals">2016–17 quarter-finals</a>; Real Madrid won 6–3 on aggregate after extra time and subsequently lifted the trophy. The following year, they met in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Semi-finals">semi-finals</a>, with Real Madrid again progressing 4–3. Until the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2018–19 season</a>, when they were twice defeated in Madrid by three-goal margins, Real's biggest loss at home in the Champions League had been at the hands of Bayern on <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20second%20group%20stage%23Real%20Madrid%20v%20Bayern%20Munich">29 February 2000</a>, 2–4.
Juventus.
Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).
Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20European%20Cup">1961–62 European Cup</a>, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. At the quarter-final stage in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1995–96</a>, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy. In the <a href="1998%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">1998 UEFA Champions League Final</a> between the teams in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, Real Madrid won 1–0. They met again in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2002–03 UEFA Champions League</a> semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate. By that time, star midfielder <a href="Zinedine%20Zidane">Zinedine Zidane</a>, who played for the "Bianconeri" in the 1998 final, had moved from <a href="Turin">Turin</a> to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.
The teams met again in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage">2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage</a>, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2014–15 UEFA Champions League</a> semi-finals, former Real Madrid player <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Morata">Álvaro Morata</a> scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid. They faced off again in the <a href="2017%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2017 UEFA Champions League Final</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.
The latest Champions League meeting was in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Quarter-finals">2017–18 quarter-finals</a>, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the <a href="Juventus%20Stadium">Allianz Stadium</a> by the same scoreline. Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick, and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time, he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.
Finances and ownership.
It was under <a href="Florentino%20P%C3%A9rez">Florentino Pérez</a>'s first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club. The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as <a href="Zinedine%20Zidane">Zinedine Zidane</a>, <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Figo">Luís Figo</a>, <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a>. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site. The <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.
The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts. Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.
By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by <a href="BBDO">BBDO</a>. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion), only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million). In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide. In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.
A study at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> concluded that Real Madrid "is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid." In 2010, "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season. According to <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a>, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.
Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a>, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money, and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a>, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership. The members of Real Madrid, called "socios", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. As of 2010, the club had 60,000 "socios". At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.
During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football. Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million. For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona; furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, "Forbes" listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion. Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">second highest-earning</a> football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million. In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona. In 2022, "Forbes" listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.

Levante UD

Levante Unión Deportiva, S.A.D. () is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football club</a> in <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>, in the <a href="Valencian%20Community">namesake autonomous community</a>.
Founded on 9 September 1909, Levante play in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, holding home games at <a href="Estadi%20Ciutat%20de%20Val%C3%A8ncia">Ciutat de València Stadium</a>.
History.
Early years (1909–1935).
Levante UD was formerly registered as <a href="Levante%20FC">Levante Football Club</a> on 9 September 1909 (celebrating its 100th anniversary on 9 September 2009). Thus Levante is the most senior football club in <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>, with rival team <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia CF</a> not being formed until 1919. 
Levante shares its name with the eastern region of the Iberian Peninsula, with Spain's east coast, the coast over which the sun rises ("levantar" in Spanish), with the Levant wind that comes from the east, and with the Levante beach in La Malvarrosa where Levante Football Club played some of its earliest fixtures. 
Levante's earliest games were played at La Platjeta, near the docks on a plot of land owned by a perfume entrepreneur. Its next ground was also near the port area, and the club gradually became associated with the working class. In 1919, the side played Valencia CF for the first time, losing 0–1; the game marked the inauguration of the recently built ground at Algirós. In 1928, Levante FC won its first trophy, the Valencian Championship.
1909 also saw the birth of <a href="Gimn%C3%A1stico%20FC">Gimnástico Football Club</a>, which originally played at Patronato de la Juventud Obrera, being then named Gimnástico-Patronato. In 1919, Gimnástico became the champion of the Campeonato de Valencia, beating CD Castellón in two leg finals; the next year, the club had become "Real Gimnástico Football Club", after being granted royal patronage by <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XIII</a>, and they reached the final of Campeonato Regional de Levante, but lost to Club Deportivo Aguileño. In 1931, with the founding of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>, the club dropped the "Real" from its name.
In <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1934–35</a>, both Levante and Gimnástico debuted in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second division</a>, when the league was expanded from 10 teams to 24. In 1935, Levante won the Campeonato Levante-Sur, a competition that featured teams from <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencia</a>, Murcia and <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, and subsequently reached the semi-finals of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Spanish Cup</a>, consecutively beating Valencia and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> before losing to eventual runners-up <a href="CE%20Sabadell%20FC">Sabadell</a>.
During the civil war: Copa de la España Libre (1937).
During the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, Levante and Gimnástico played in the <a href="Mediterranean%20League">Mediterranean League</a>, finishing fifth and sixth respectively. Teams from this league also competed in the <a href="Copa%20de%20la%20Espa%C3%B1a%20Libre">Copa de la España Libre</a> ("Free Spain Cup"). It was originally intended that the top four teams from the league would enter the cup, but Barcelona opted to tour Mexico and the United States, and as a result, Levante took its place. The first round of the competition was a mini-league with the top two teams, Levante and Valencia, qualifying for the final. On 18 July 1937, Levante defeated its city rivals 1–0 at the <a href="Estadi%20Ol%C3%ADmpic%20Llu%C3%ADs%20Companys">Montjuïc</a>.
Merging: Gimnástico and Levante (1939).
During the Civil War, Levante's ground was destroyed, but the club's squad remained intact. In contrast, Gimnástico had a ground, <a href="Estadio%20de%20Vallejo">Estadio de Vallejo</a>, but had lost most of their players. As a result, in 1939 Levante FC and Gimnástico FC merged into Levante Unión Deportiva. Levante UD can thus trace its origin back to at least 1909 through both Levante FC and Gimnástico FC. The merged club was at first named Unión Deportiva Levante-Gimnástico, then changed it a few years later to . The current club colours date from this era: the "blaugrana", blue-garnet, home colours were originally those of <a href="Gimn%C3%A1stico%20FC">Gimnástico FC</a>, while the black and white away kit were the colours of . Levante UD also inherited from Gimnástico FC their nickname, <a href="wiktionary%3Agranota">"Granota"</a>, the Frogs.
La Liga: relegations and promotions (1963–present).
Levante had to wait until the 1960s to make its <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> debut. In 1963, the club finished runner-up in Group II of the second division, defeating <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a> 4–2 on aggregate in the promotion play-offs. During <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20La%20Liga">the first top flight season</a>, it managed to win both games against Valencia, and also achieved a 5–1 home win against Barcelona in <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20La%20Liga">the 1964–65 campaign</a>, but was relegated nonetheless after losing in the playoffs against <a href="CD%20M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a>. It spent most of the following two decades in the second and <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">third divisions</a>; the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> would not be created until 1977.
In the early 1980s, Dutch superstar <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a> played half a season for the club, retiring three years later. After winning <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2003–04's second division</a>, Levante returned to the top level but survived only <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20La%20Liga">one season</a>. Finishing third in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2005–06</a>, it returned for two additional campaigns, the decisive match in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">2006–07 season</a> being a 4–2 home win against Valencia courtesy of <a href="Riga%20Mustapha">Riga Mustapha</a> (two goals), <a href="Salva%20Ballesta">Salva</a> and <a href="Laurent%20Courtois">Laurent Courtois</a>.
Levante's financial status worsened, however, and there were reports that the players had only received approximately one-fifth of their contractual payments. News reports stated that the club had incurred a debt of over €18 million in payments due to its players. The team plummeted down the standings, and it was confirmed with several matches to go that the club would be playing in the second division in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2008–09</a>. The players protested at their lack of payments at one point, refusing to move for several seconds after the opening whistle against Deportivo and later announcing that they would <a href="Strike%20action">strike</a> during the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">season</a>-ending game at <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. The threat was withdrawn when league officials announced that a benefit game would be played between a Levante XI and a Primera División XI, with all receipts going to pay the Levante players' wages.
On 13 June 2010, Levante returned to La Liga after a 3–1 home win against <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">already relegated</a> <a href="CD%20Castell%C3%B3n">Castellón</a>, making its final round 0–4 defeat at <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> irrelevant. Under the manager who led the team back to the top flight, <a href="Luis%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Plaza">Luis García Plaza</a>, Levante finally retained its top division status in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20La%20Liga">2010–11 season</a>. At one point in the league's second round of matches, Levante was third in the table behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, after losing just once (against Real Madrid) in 12 games.
On 26 October 2011, during round nine of <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20La%20Liga">the season</a>, Levante defeated <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a> 3–2 to move top of the first division table for the first time in the club's history, with 23 points. In the process, it recorded seven straight wins after drawing its first two games. The club eventually finished sixth after defeating <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> 3–0 at home in its last match, thus <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">qualifying</a> for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> for the first time in its history. There, they made it to the last 16 before a 2–0 extra-time loss to Russia's <a href="FC%20Rubin%20Kazan">FC Rubin Kazan</a>.
In the <a href="2015-16%20La%20Liga">2015–16 season</a>, Levante was relegated after defeat by <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20CF">Málaga</a> and finished last. The club was promoted back to the top league in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2016–17</a>, winning the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> title. In the <a href="2017-18%20La%20Liga">2017–18 season</a>, the club secured safety in the league and on 13 May, beat the champions <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> 5–4 (having led 5–1 early in the second half), with <a href="Emmanuel%20Boateng%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201996%29">Emmanuel Boateng</a> scoring his first ever career hat-trick. This win ended Barcelona's hopes of achieving an unbeaten season.
In the <a href="2021-22%20La%20Liga">2021–22 season</a>, Levante was relegated after being defeated 0-6 by Real Madrid, ending their five years in the top tier.

History.
20th-century history (1928–2001).
Real Valladolid was founded from the merger of Real Unión Deportiva de Valladolid and Club Deportivo Español, the club played its first game on 22 September 1928. It was a 2–1 win over Alavés. Valladolid first reached the <a href="La%20Liga">top level</a> in the 1947–48 season, as champions of the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>. The club became the first Castile and León club to play in the Spanish top flight. The following year, the team pushed on from this success and reached the finals of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> in <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Chamartín Stadium</a> against <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>, losing 4–1.
The next ten years were spent in the first division, and relegation was short-lived as Valladolid gained promotion again in 1958–59 with a 5–0 win over <a href="Terrassa%20FC">Terrassa</a> under manager José Luis Saso, a legendary figure in club history. He had originally been a goalkeeper for the club and went on to perform many roles, including serving as president of the club.
Valladolid swung between the first and second divisions in subsequent years, falling as low as to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">third</a> division in 1970–71. Next year the club was promoted to second division and in 1980 promoted to first division, where Valladolid played until 1992 when the club was relegated to the second division again. Promoted in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1992–93</a>, the club was again sent down after the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20La%20Liga">2003–04 season</a>. In 1984, Valladolid also won the <a href="Copa%20de%20la%20Liga">Copa de la Liga</a> (a competition only played in the early 1980s) over <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>.
On 14 April 1996, Valladolid played its 1,000th game in La Liga.
The side's highest position during this 11-year stint was seventh in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20La%20Liga">1996–97</a>, being coached in the previous seasons by former <a href="Real%20Madrid%20Castilla">Real Madrid Castilla</a> coach <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a>, as various players from that team would also later appear for Valladolid.
Carlos Suárez era (2001–2018).
In the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2006–07 season</a>, after signing <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque</a> <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Mendilibar">José Luis Mendilibar</a> as head coach, Valladolid had one of its best years in its history while playing in the second level. The club took the league lead in the 15th matchday and went on to finish with a competition all-time high 88 points, winning the championship by a total margin of eight points, and holding an advantage of 26 points over the non-promotion zone (fourth and below), both being all-time records in the league. Valladolid also achieved the honour of going unbeaten in 29-straight matches, from 10 October 2006 to 6 May 2007, being mathematically promoted after a 2–0 away win against <a href="CD%20Tenerife">Tenerife</a> on 22 April 2007 (the 34th matchday of the season), the earliest any club has achieved promotion in Spanish history.
Also remarkable was the side's role in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Copa%20del%20Rey">the season</a>'s <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, reaching the quarter-finals after defeating two top division teams, <a href="Gimn%C3%A0stic%20de%20Tarragona">Gimnàstic de Tarragona</a> (4–1 aggregate) and the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2005–06 UEFA Champions League</a> contender <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a> (3–1), while playing the entire competition with reserve players.
Two relatively successful seasons in the top division followed, finishing in 15th place while avoiding relegation after a 1–1 draw on the last matchday of both seasons (against <a href="Recreativo%20de%20Huelva">Recreativo de Huelva</a> in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">2007–08</a> and <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">the following campaign</a>).
After a slow start to <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20La%20Liga">2009–10</a> (three wins in the first 20 matches), Mendilibar was sacked on 1 February 2010 following a draw at home against <a href="UD%20Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a>. The week following his sacking, Valladolid dropped into the relegation zone (something that never happened during Mendilibar's 138-match stint), with former player <a href="On%C3%A9simo%20S%C3%A1nchez">Onésimo Sánchez</a> taking charge.
After only one win in 10 matches, Sánchez was fired. Former <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spain national team</a> manager <a href="Javier%20Clemente">Javier Clemente</a> was named Sánchez's replacement in a desperate move to avoid relegation with only eight matches remaining. After a brief breather (16th position), Valladolid again returned to the bottom three, then faced a must-win last game at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> against a <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> squad needing a win to secure the Liga championship. Level in the standings with <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Racing de Santander</a>, <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20CF">Málaga</a> and Tenerife for the two final safe positions, Valladolid lost 0–4 and consequently was relegated, ending a three-year stay in the top flight.
The <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2011–12 season</a> saw Valladolid return to La Liga under the management of <a href="Miroslav%20%C4%90uki%C4%87">Miroslav Đukić</a>, promoted through the play-offs after finishing third in the division.
Valladolid were relegated back to the Segunda División on the last matchday of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">2013–14 season</a>.
In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2017–18 season</a>, Valladolid was promoted back to first division after four years via play-off defeating <a href="Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n">Sporting de Gijón</a> and <a href="CD%20Numancia">Numancia</a>.
Ronaldo Nazario, new owner (2018–present).
In the summer of 2018, a series of purchase offers were presented by several foreign entrepreneurs. This process concluded with the acquisition led by the former Brazilian player <a href="Ronaldo%20Naz%C3%A1rio">Ronaldo Nazário</a>, who was officially introduced as the majority shareholder and president of the board of directors on 3 September 2018. The presentation took place in the reception hall of the Valladolid City Hall. It's worth noting that the former president, , continued in the role of CEO until he resigned in August 2019.
When Ronaldo was introduced, the team had already completed the first three rounds of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20La%20Liga">2018–19 La Liga season</a>. Despite failing to score any goals, they managed to secure two draws out of three matches, largely due to their strong defensive performance. Their standing improved to 6th place by the 10th round, but a lack of goals combined with a deteriorating defense resulted in a series of unfavorable outcomes. Throughout April, they found themselves periodically in positions that could lead to relegation. However, the team's performance notably picked up in the final rounds of the season, ensuring their safety in the league mathematically one match prior to the end of the championship. As part of changes, Calero, who had performed well, was transferred to <a href="Espanyol">Espanyol</a> for a fee of 8 million euros plus additional variables.
<a href="Sergio%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20Soriano">Sergio González Soriano</a> continued as the coach for the 2019–20 season. The <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a> caused a pause in the season on 13 March when the team was in 15th place, four points above the relegation zone. The league resumed from mid-June to mid-July, with the team securing safety in the second-to-last round and finishing 13th, their best position in 18 seasons. Throughout the season, Valladolid avoided relegation positions, relying on effective but not flashy play. The standout was Salisu, a Ghanaian defender from the youth team, who excelled in defense. He was sold to Southampton FC for 12 million euros in the summer, a record sale for Valladolid. In January, Ronaldo signed high-profile player <a href="Ben%20Arfa">Ben Arfa</a>, who played sparingly and left at the season's end.
On 23 May 2020, a preliminary agreement was announced with the <a href="Club%20Baloncesto%20Ciudad%20de%20Algeciras">Club Baloncesto Ciudad de Valladolid</a> for collaboration between the two entities. The merger would result in the basketball club becoming a section within Real Valladolid. Among the changes would be alterations to the club's colors and the basketball team's name. On 10 July 2020, members of Atlético Tordesillas agreed to have the team become a subsidiary of Real Valladolid for one season, extendable over time. Atlético Tordesillas would retain its legal identity and board of directors. The agreement would bring young players from the Valladolid academy, a full coaching staff funded by Valladolid, training for lower division coaches at Tordesillas, supply of sports equipment, and the presence of Valladolid's groundkeepers to maintain the Tordesillas team's fields.
On 3 August 2020, a 3-year collaboration agreement was signed with Club Baloncesto Ciudad de <a href="Valladolid">Valladolid</a>. The basketball team's name changed to <a href="Real%20Valladolid%20Baloncesto">Real Valladolid Baloncesto</a>, adopting white and purple colors. David Espinar, the basketball team's director, joined the board of directors. This partnership aimed to attract resources, strengthen fan connections, and enhance public relations. On 21 August 2020, the agreement with <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Tordesillas">Atlético Tordesillas</a> was confirmed, making it the club's second subsidiary team..
The 2020–21 season began in September instead of August due to the COVID-19-induced pause. The RFEF established rules for the 2020–21 league that required teams in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> and <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> to find alternative stadiums for home matches in case COVID-19 complications prevented matches from being played at their regular venues. The preferred option was the <a href="Estadio%20Nueva%20Balastera">Estadio Nueva Balastera</a> in <a href="Palencia">Palencia</a>, provided it met the minimum requirements set by the <a href="Liga%20Nacional%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20Profesional">LFP</a>. The alternative, however, needed to be located outside the club's <a href="Autonomous%20Community">Autonomous Community</a>. Therefore, stadiums in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> were the most likely candidates, and even the possibility of a mutual agreement to share the alternative stadium with another team was considered. Furthermore, during this season, five substitutions in three intervals per match would continue to be allowed. A protocol was designed to address issues like playing surfaces, schedules, first-team player numbers, and what would happen if matches couldn't be played or if positive COVID-19 cases were detected among teams, coaches, and players. The protocol also covered the promotion playoffs to La Liga.
On 18 September 2020, alternative venues for home matches were announced. The primary option was either the <a href="Estadio%20Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u">Estadio Santiago Bernabéu</a> (depending on the progress of ongoing renovations) or the <a href="Estadio%20Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano</a> in Madrid. The secondary choices were the Estadio Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán in <a href="Seville">Seville</a> and the <a href="Estadio%20de%20Bala%C3%ADdos">Estadio de Balaídos</a> in <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a>. Additionally, <a href="Valladolid">Valladolid</a> was a highly sought-after host city, being selected as the primary alternative venue by <a href="Real%20Madrid%20Club%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol">Real Madrid CF</a> and <a href="Real%20Club%20Celta%20de%20Vigo">Real Celta de Vigo</a> to play their matches at the <a href="Estadio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Zorrilla">Estadio José Zorrilla</a>. <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20de%20Madrid">Atlético de Madrid</a>, however, opted for another venue. Valladolid was also considered for the list of alternatives, with convenient flight connections in mind, with cities like <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a> and <a href="M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a>.
Despite the disappointing results, Real Valladolid had a slim chance of avoiding relegation until the very last matchday. They needed to beat the league champions, <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20de%20Madrid">Atlético de Madrid</a>, and hope their rivals didn't win their matches. Unfortunately, this scenario didn't play out, resulting in relegation as the second-to-last team. The club faced criticism from fans for not taking adequate measures to prevent relegation. Despite various challenges including injuries and COVID-19 absences, coach <a href="Sergio%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20Soriano">Sergio González Soriano</a> remained in charge throughout the season, ultimately leading the team back to the lower division.
The following season, 2021–22, marked Real Valladolid's 36th season in the second tier. The main goal was to rekindle the fans' enthusiasm after one of the worst seasons in the club's history. On 22 June 2021, the subsidiary agreement with Atlético Tordesillas was terminated due to Real Valladolid's relegation. Despite this, the collaboration between the two clubs continued. After a somewhat inconsistent start, the team began 2022 with a strong defense, surpassing the team's previous unbeaten record. It's important to note that the earlier record was set in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> by César Sánchez, who went 555 minutes without conceding a goal. This achievement spanned from the 85th minute (goal by <a href="Julen%20Guerrero">Julen Guerrero</a>) of matchday 33 in the <a href="La%20Liga%201997-98">1997–98 season</a> to the 10th minute (goal by <a href="Predrag%20Mijatovi%C4%87">Predrag Mijatović</a>) of matchday 2 in the <a href="La%20Liga%201998-99">1998–99 season</a>. Ultimately, the record was extended to 646 minutes by <a href="Jordi%20Masip">Jordi Masip</a> between the 29th-minute goal by <a href="Borja%20Bast%C3%B3n">Borja Bastón</a> on matchday 20 and the 45th-minute goal by <a href="Bernardo%20Espinosa">Bernardo Espinosa</a> on matchday 27. The team eventually secured direct promotion by defeating <a href="Sociedad%20Deportiva%20Huesca">S.D. Huesca</a> 3–0 in the final matchday, even though it relied on results from <a href="Uni%C3%B3n%20Deportiva%20Almer%C3%ADa">U.D. Almería</a> and <a href="Sociedad%20Deportiva%20Eibar">S.D. Eibar</a>. These results materialized with Almería drawing at <a href="Estadio%20Municipal%20de%20Butarque">Butarque</a> and Eibar surprisingly losing to A.D. Alcorcón, who had been relegated for several rounds. Despite this, Alcorcón finished as the bottom team in the second division. Valladolid concluded the season as runners-up, being the top goal-scorers with 71 goals, largely thanks to the 20 goals contributed by Israeli player <a href="Shon%20Weissman">Shon Weissman</a>. Furthermore, they set a record by spending the fewest matchdays in direct promotion positions before securing promotion, achieving this in only 5 matchdays in total.
The 2022–23 season of La Liga began with Pacheta as the coach, following their promotion, and notable signings like the return of academy graduate <a href="Sergio%20Asenjo">Sergio Asenjo</a> and Valladolid native <a href="Sergio%20Escudero%20Palomo">Sergio Escudero</a>. The season was marked by inconsistent performance, swinging between periods of positive and negative results, often conceding goals in the closing minutes of matches. The team managed to stay above the relegation zone until the break for the <a href="2022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Qatar World Cup</a>.
During the winter transfer window, new players were brought in to elevate the team's performance, but injuries hindered the contribution of some players. <a href="Paulo%20Pezzolano">Paulo Pezzolano</a> replaced Pacheta as the coach after the team conceded six goals in a single match. Despite Pezzolano's efforts, the team's irregular form persisted. In the final matchday, playing at home against Getafe, Valladolid was relegated, marking their fifth relegation in two decades, making them the most relegated team in the 21st century.
The day after relegation, President Ronaldo confirmed Pezzolano as the coach for the 2023–24 season. Just days before the new season's start, <a href="Fran%20S%C3%A1nchez">Fran Sánchez</a> was dismissed, and Domingo Catoira took over as the sporting director. The fans' dissatisfaction with these changes, along with concerns about the team's direction and squad changes, were evident during the Trofeo Ciudad de Valladolid, with strong protests against the club's leadership, including chants calling for Ronaldo's departure.
Stadium.
Real Valladolid play at the 26,421-capacity <a href="Estadio%20Nuevo%20Jos%C3%A9%20Zorrilla">Estadio Nuevo José Zorrilla</a>, finished in 1982 to replace the <a href="Estadio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Zorrilla%20%281940%29">previous stadium of the same name</a> which had stood since 1940(increased it's capacity from 27,846). Both grounds are named after <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Zorrilla%20y%20Moral">José Zorrilla y Moral</a>, a 19th-century poet from the city. After opening for the club on 20 February 1982, it hosted the <a href="1982%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey Final on 13 April of that year</a>, and then three Group D matches at the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 FIFA World Cup</a>. The venue is owned by the <a href="Ayuntamiento%20de%20Valladolid">Ayuntamiento de Valladolid</a>.
In 2010, it was announced that there were plans to expand the stadium to 40,000 spectators. This project was known as Valladolid Arena , but was contingent on Spain winning the right to host the 2018 FIFA World cup.

Hércules CF

Hércules de Alicante Club de Fútbol, S.A.D. () is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> in <a href="Alicante">Alicante</a>, in the <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencian Community</a>. Founded on 25 October 1922, it currently plays in <a href="Segunda%20Federaci%C3%B3n">Segunda Federación</a> – Group 3, and plays its home games at the 29,500-capacity <a href="Estadio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Rico%20P%C3%A9rez">Estadio José Rico Pérez</a>.
History.
Hércules CF has been documented since 1914 although not officially registered until 26 September 1922, alongside Mercantil de Cartagena, Federación Levantina and others. Its founder was Vicente Pastor Alfosea dubbed "El Chepa". In its early days, the club played in various locations, the foothills of la montañosa, the lands of l'Hort del tio Ron, the campo de Benalúa or the facilities of the Alicante Recreation Club.
Hercules joined a youth league, becoming champion in 1918. The first official match was in 1919 against <a href="Athletic%20Club%20Benaluense">Athletic Club Benaluense</a>, Hercules winning 2–1. At first the team played in white and red striped shirts and black pants.
After first appearing in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20La%20Liga">1935–36 season</a>, Hércules would play sporadically in the category for the next 40 years, playing mainly in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second division</a> but going as low as <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the third</a>. From 1961 to 1969, neighbours <a href="Alicante%20CF">Alicante</a> acted as its <a href="Farm%20team">feeder club</a>.
After a ten-year spell in the top flight, encompassing 12 seasons in the 1970s and '80s, the club only returned again in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20La%20Liga">1996–97 campaign</a>. Though eventually relegated, it managed two remarkable comeback wins over <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, which ultimately handed the Liga title to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>.
In <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2004–05</a>, after five years in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">third level</a>, Hércules finished second, being subsequently promoted to the "silver category". After posting three consecutive solid seasons, the club narrowly missed out on a return to the top division in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2009</a>, finishing fourth, three points behind last-promotee <a href="CD%20Tenerife">Tenerife</a>.
The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2009–10 campaign</a> saw Hércules promoted back into the top flight after 14 years in dramatic fashion: losing 0–1 at <a href="half-time">half-time</a> at <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a>, the team fought back to win 2–1 in the penultimate game of the season and leap frogged <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> into third place. In the last round, a 2–0 away win against relegation-threatened <a href="Real%20Uni%C3%B3n">Real Unión</a> guaranteed promotion, with the 4–0 win of Betis over <a href="Levante%20UD">Levante</a> eventually counting for nothing (all three teams – Levante, Hércules and Betis – ended equal on points).
Early into the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20La%20Liga">2010–11 season</a>, one year, three months and 19 days after Barcelona's last home defeat in the league, Hércules recorded a shock 2–0 win at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> thanks to a brace from <a href="Nelson%20Valdez">Nelson Valdez</a> – Barcelona had won their last 11 home matches, scored at least three times in each of their last six league fixtures and were protecting a 17-game unbeaten streak. This was the Alicante outfit's third successive win over the Barcelona, having won both meetings in their previous top flight campaign <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20La%20Liga">14 years before</a>.
In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2013–14 campaign</a>, they were relegated to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> after finishing in last place in the Segunda División.
In the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2016–17 Copa del Rey</a>, the team drew 1–1 with Barcelona. In the second match at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> (Barcelona's home), Hércules was defeated by the Catalonian side 7–0.

UD Almería

Unión Deportiva Almería, S.A.D. () is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish professional football club</a> based in <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. Founded on 26 July 1989 and known as "Almería Club de Fútbol" until 2001, when it was renamed "Unión Deportiva Almería". The club currently plays in the Spanish <a href="La%20Liga">Primera División</a> after winning the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> title in 2022, and plays their home games at the 15,274-seat capacity <a href="Power%20Horse%20Stadium">Power Horse Stadium</a>.
History.
The first football club in <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a> was founded in 1909: el Almería Foot-Ball Club. Since then, several Almería football clubs appeared and disappeared. One of them was <a href="AD%20Almer%C3%ADa">AD Almería</a>, a team that played in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> between 1979–81, but disappeared in 1982, and was arguably UD Almería's predecessor. 
In 1989, a club named "Almería Club de Fútbol" was born, but in 2001 was renamed "Unión Deportiva Almería". On 19 January 2001 the mayor of <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a> Santiago Martínez Cabrejas announced in the city council that the new club UD Almería had been formed after the merger of two city teams - Polideportivo Almería and Almería CF. But UD Almería was not official until 28 June 2001, when Almería CF approved at the General Meeting of Shareholders the renaming. After playing one season in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second division</a>, it was relegated to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">third</a> and the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">fourth divisions</a>.
After spending several seasons in the second level, Almería side was first promoted to the top flight after finishing runner-up in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2006–07 season</a>. After some outstanding performances, as the away win against <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a> 3–0 in the first <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> match, the team achieved a final 8th league place in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">2007–08</a>. At the club's helm was coach <a href="Unai%20Emery">Unai Emery</a>, as <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Negredo">Álvaro Negredo</a> finished team topscorer with 13 goals.
After Emery left for <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia CF</a>, <a href="Gonzalo%20Arconada%20Echarri">Gonzalo Arconada</a> stepped in, but was sacked on 21 December 2008, after a string of poor results, albeit without ever reaching the last three. <a href="Mexico">Mexican</a> <a href="Hugo%20S%C3%A1nchez">Hugo Sánchez</a> took the job, and fared slightly better, for a <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">final mid-table position</a>.
In <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20La%20Liga">2010–11</a>, Almería <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Copa%20del%20Rey">reached the semifinals</a> of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> for the first time ever. In the league, however, the club was finally relegated after a four-year spell in the top flight; in November 2010, coach <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20Lillo">Juan Manuel Lillo</a> was fired after a 0–8 home loss against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> (precisely the team that ousted the Andalusians in the domestic cup's last-four, with the same score, but on aggregate), and his successor <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Oltra">José Luis Oltra</a> met the same fate, in April 2011. He was replaced by <a href="Roberto%20Olabe%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201967%29">Roberto Olabe</a>.
After two seasons in the second level, Almería returned to the main category of Spanish football on 22 June 2013, after defeating <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona FC</a> in the <a href="2013%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20play-offs">play-offs</a>. After the departure of manager <a href="Javi%20Gracia">Javi Gracia</a>, the club appointed their former player and manager of <a href="UD%20Almer%C3%ADa%20B">the reserves</a> at the time <a href="Francisco%20Javier%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20V%C3%ADlchez">Francisco Javier Rodríguez Vílchez</a>; the team eventually managed to survive in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">2013–14</a>, finishing 16th.

CD Castellón

Club Deportivo Castellón, S.A.D. is a professional <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Castell%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Plana">Castellón de la Plana</a>, in the <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencian Community</a>. Founded on 20 July 1922, it currently plays in , holding home games at "<a href="Nou%20Estadi%20Cast%C3%A0lia">Nou Estadi Castàlia</a>", which has a capacity of 15,500 seats.
History.
Football first appeared in the town in 1911, and after a period of time under the consecutive denominations "Deportivo", "Castalia", "Gimnástico", "Cultural" and "Cervantes", Club Deportivo Castellón was founded on 22 July 1922.
The club featured periodically in the <a href="La%20Liga">top flight</a>, finishing fifth in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20La%20Liga">1972–73</a> and adding a <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Cup</a> final appearance with a team featuring <a href="Vicente%20del%20Bosque">Vicente del Bosque</a>, who later moved to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>, serving the club as both a player and coach.
On 29 August 1991, in an extraordinary assembly, the conversion of the club to S.A.D. was approved. The first team had just <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20La%20Liga">relegated</a> into <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">division two</a>, and would drop another level to <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">the third</a> <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">three years later</a>, in a spell which would last more than one decade.
In the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2004–05 season</a>, Castellón finished fourth in "Segunda B", eventually winning its promotion playoffs (both matches) and achieving a return to the silver category. The club's stint in the division would last five years, as relegation would befall in <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2009–10</a>, with the <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencian Community</a> outfit ranking last, 13 points behind the following team.
On 18 July 2011, due to the team not paying its players, Castellón was excluded from the third division, being relegated to <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the fourth</a>. In June 2017, former player <a href="Pablo%20Hern%C3%A1ndez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201985%29">Pablo Hernández</a> became joint owner of the club, leading a consortium alongside <a href="Angel%20Dealbert">Angel Dealbert</a>, businessman Vicente Montesinos and others.
On 21 March 2018, Castellón beat the record of seasonal tickets in the fourth division previously held by <a href="Real%20Oviedo">Real Oviedo</a> with 12,700, establishing the new record at 12,867. On 24 June 2018, it returned to the third tier after a seven-year absence.
On 26 July 2020, Castellón promoted back to second division after 10 years by beating <a href="UE%20Cornell%C3%A0">Cornellà</a> in final play off promotion, but they were immediately relegated in the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2020–21 season</a>.

CD Logroñés

Club Deportivo Logroñés, S.A.D. was a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Logro%C3%B1o">Logroño</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="La%20Rioja%20%28Spain%29">La Rioja</a>. Founded in 1940, it last played in "<a href="Regional%20Preferente%20de%20La%20Rioja">Regional Preferente de La Rioja</a>".
Due to financial problems, since 2009 the club has not played in any competition. The club, who appeared in nine <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> seasons, was replaced by <a href="UD%20Logro%C3%B1%C3%A9s">UD Logroñés</a> and <a href="SD%20Logro%C3%B1%C3%A9s">SD Logroñés</a>.
History.
After "<a href="CD%20Logro%C3%B1o">Club Deportivo Logroño</a>", the new "Club Deportivo Logroñés" saw the light of day after the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, on 30 May 1940. Until 1950, it played in "<a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>", after which it achieved a <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second level</a> promotion.
After falling short of reaching the <a href="La%20Liga">top flight</a> in 1952, Logroñés fluctuated between various <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">levels of Spanish football</a>. On 14 June 1987, <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">already promoted</a> <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia CF</a> visited <a href="Estadio%20Las%20Gaunas%20%281923%29">Estadio Las Gaunas</a>, and were defeated 1–0, as the <a href="La%20Rioja%20%28Spain%29">Riojans</a> gained first division rights for the first time ever.
In <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20La%20Liga">1989–90</a>, the team finished an all-time best seventh, just two points short of a <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> qualification, and would remain in the top level until 1997, save for a short return to level two in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1995–96</a>, after it <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20La%20Liga">finished last the previous season</a> with just 13 points.
After a double relegation in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1999–2000</a> (on the pitch and off it), it quickly returned to the third level, but new and worse economic problems arose, and the club was again relegated to "Tercera" in July 2004.
At the end of 2007–08, Logroñés returned once more to the fourth division due to its substantial salary commitments, in spite of the club's 13th-place finish in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">the season</a>. Financial troubles continued into the first weeks of 2009, as only nine players took the field for its 4 January 2009 match against <a href="CD%20Arnedo">CD Arnedo</a>, in protest against still overdue payments.
This was Logroñés' last match in the competition, as the side did not present itself at all for the next match, against CD Tedeón, and were therefore retired from the competition, being consequently relegated to "<a href="Divisiones%20Regionales%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20in%20La%20Rioja">Regional Preferente de La Rioja</a>" by the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Royal Spanish Football Federation</a>.

RCD Espanyol

Real Club Deportiu Espanyol de Barcelona (; "Royal Spanish Sports Club of Barcelona"), commonly known as Espanyol, is a Spanish professional <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a> based in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, Spain. They compete in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, the second division of the <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football league system</a>.
Founded in 1900 in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, Espanyol currently play their home games at the <a href="RCDE%20Stadium">RCDE Stadium</a>, which holds up to 40,000 spectators. Domestically, Espanyol has won the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> four times, most recently in <a href="2006%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2006</a>. In international competitions, the club reached the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> final in <a href="1988%20UEFA%20Cup%20final">1988</a> and <a href="2007%20UEFA%20Cup%20final">2007</a>. It has a <a href="Derbi%20barcelon%C3%AD">long-standing rivalry with FC Barcelona</a>.
Name.
Initially known as the Sociedad Española de Football on its foundation, the name was changed to Club Español de Fútbol in 1901. In 1906, the club folded due to financial reasons and most of the players joined the <a href="X%20Sporting%20Club">X Sporting Club</a>, which came to win the <a href="Catalan%20football%20championship">Campionat de Catalunya</a> three times in a row before disappearing in 1908 to merge with the Spanish Jiu-Jitsu Club to be effectively relaunched as the Club Deportivo Español, and in 1910, they adopted their present-day colours. Espanyol is one of several Spanish football clubs granted patronage by the <a href="List%20of%20Spanish%20monarchs">Spanish crown</a> and thus entitled to use "Real" in their names and the <a href="Spanish%20Royal%20Crown">royal crown</a> on their badge. This right was granted to Espanyol in 1912 by <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XIII</a> and the club subsequently became known as the Real Club Deportivo Español.
Following the abdication of the same king in 1931 and the declaration of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>, due to prohibition of royal symbols, the club adopted the more Catalan/republican friendly name, Club Esportiu Espanyol. After the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, the name was reverted.
The club took the Catalan spelling for its name in February 1995. The word ""Deportiu" in Reial Club Deportiu Espanyol de Barcelona is a Catalanised form of the original word "Deportivo"" (<a href="Castilian%20language">Castilian</a>), despite the correct word being "Esportiu" in the Catalan language. This choice was made in order to retain the initials "RCD" in the club's name.
History.
Foundation and club culture.
Espanyol was founded on 28 October 1900 by Ángel Rodríguez Ruiz (1879–1959), an engineering student at the <a href="University%20of%20Barcelona">University of Barcelona</a>. The club's original home was in the well-off district of <a href="Sarri%C3%A0-Sant%20Gervasi">Sarrià</a>; Espanyol was the first club in Spain to be formed exclusively by Spanish fans of the game, with the other early clubs having links to Britain or central Europe.
The club originally played in bright yellow shirts, with the colour of the shorts being left to the individual player. A friend of the club founder owned a textile business and happened to have an abundance of yellow material left over from a job. In 1910, the club changed its name to the Club Deportivo Español and chose blue and white stripes as shirt colours and as the central colours of the club badge. Blue and white were chosen in homage to the colours appearing on the shield of the great Sicilian-Aragonese Admiral <a href="Roger%20de%20Lluria">Roger de Lluria</a>, who sailed the Mediterranean protecting the interests of the Crown of Aragon in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The club was successful from the very beginning, winning the first <a href="Catalan%20football%20championship">Campionat de Catalunya</a> in 1903 and subsequently playing in the very first <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> in <a href="1903%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1903</a>.
In 1906 "Club Español de Football" had to suspend its activities due to a lack of players, since most of them were university students who enrolled to study at universities outside <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. X Sporting Club took advantage of this as most of the remaining Español players joined them, which meant a big leap in quality for the club, and as a result, the X won the <a href="Catalan%20football%20championship">Catalan championship</a> three times in a row between 1905 and 1908, beating the likes of <a href="FC%20Internacional">FC Internacional</a> and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> for the title. This historic side had the likes of <a href="Pedro%20Gibert%20%28footballer%29">Pedro Gibert</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ir%C3%ADzar">José Irízar</a> and <a href="Santiago%20Massana">Santiago Massana</a>. It was not until 1909 that X and Español were restructured again, when several of the former university students returned to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> with the idea of refounding "Club Español de Football", which they achieved on 27 December 1908, when X merged with the Spanish Jiu-Jitsu Club.
In the 1910s, they won the <a href="Catalan%20football%20championship">Campionat de Catalunya</a> three times, in 1911–12, 1914–15 and 1917–18, winning later largely thanks to their backline led by <a href="Ricardo%20Zamora">Ricardo Zamora</a>. They also reached the final of the Copa del Rey twice in <a href="1911%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1911</a> and <a href="1915%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1915</a>, but lost to <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> on both occasions.
In 1994, Espanyol created its <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a>, <a href="RCD%20Espanyol%20B">Espanyol B</a>, currently playing in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>.
Two UEFA Cup finals (1988–2009).
<a href="Javier%20Clemente">Javier Clemente</a> was hired in 1986. In his first season, he took the team to a joint-best 3rd place, qualifying for the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. They defeated <a href="Borussia%20M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Borussia Mönchengladbach</a>, <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a>, <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a>, <a href="TJ%20Vitkovice">TJ Vitkovice</a> and <a href="Club%20Brugge%20KV">Club Brugge KV</a> to reach the <a href="1988%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, losing on penalties to <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer 04 Leverkusen</a> after a 3–3 aggregate draw. Two relegations followed, but the club remained in La Liga from winning the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1993–94 Segunda División</a> until relegated at the conclusion of the 2019-20 COVID pandemic impacted season.
President from 1989 to 1993, Juli Pardo oversaw the transformation of the club into a <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">Sociedad Anónima Deportiva</a>. In the wake of the accumulated debt, the club were forced to sell the <a href="Sarri%C3%A0%20Stadium">Sarrià Stadium</a>, which was eventually demolished in 1997.
<a href="Paco%20Flores">Paco Flores</a>' Espanyol won the <a href="2000%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2000 Copa del Rey Final</a> 2–1 against <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> at <a href="Mestalla">Mestalla</a>, a first cup win since 1940. Six years later, under <a href="Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Lotina">Miguel Ángel Lotina</a>, the club won again, this time 4–1 against <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a> in Madrid, with goals by <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Tamudo">Raúl Tamudo</a>, <a href="Luis%20Garc%C3%ADa%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29">Luis García</a> (two) and <a href="Ferr%C3%A1n%20Corominas">Coro</a>.
With this cup win, Espanyol entered the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>. They won all their group games, before dispatching <a href="A.S.%20Livorno%20Calcio">Livorno</a>, <a href="Maccabi%20Haifa%20F.C.">Maccabi Haifa</a>, <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a>, and <a href="SV%20Werder%20Bremen">Werder Bremen</a> to reach the final. In the final, held on 16 May at <a href="Hampden%20Park">Hampden Park</a> in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, Espanyol fell to fellow La Liga side <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, losing 3–1 in a shootout following a 2–2 draw. They became the only football team in UEFA Cup history to remain unbeaten in the tournament, yet not take home the trophy. <a href="Walter%20Pandiani">Walter Pandiani</a>, who would leave the club at the end of the season, was the UEFA Cup's top goalscorer that season. On 9 June 2007, Tamudo became Espanyol's highest-ever goalscorer after surpassing the 111 goals scored by <a href="Rafael%20Mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n">Rafael Marañón</a>, and ended the night with 113.
On 31 May 2009, Espanyol played its last match at the <a href="Estadi%20Ol%C3%ADmpic%20Llu%C3%ADs%20Companys">Estadio Olímpico de Montjuic</a>, a 3–0 defeat of <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20CF">Málaga</a>. Espanyol had played in the Estadi Olímpic after moving from their previous ground in Sarria. With the move, club talisman Raúl Tamudo had the unique distinction of having played in three different home stadiums with his club: Sarrià, Montjuïc and, beginning in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20La%20Liga">2009–10 season</a>, the Cornellà-El Prat.
Recent years (2009–present).
In January 2009, former Espanyol defender <a href="Mauricio%20Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> was hired as manager with the club in the relegation zone – his first senior job. He won 2–1 against rivals Barcelona at the Camp Nou in February to help keep the club up; Barcelona, under <a href="Pep%20Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a>, won the <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a> that season.
After 12 seasons playing at the <a href="Estadi%20Ol%C3%ADmpic%20Llu%C3%ADs%20Companys">Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc</a>, Espanyol moved to the <a href="RCDE%20Stadium">Estadi de Cornellá-El Prat</a>. The new stadium was officially inaugurated on 2 August 2009 with a match between Espanyol and <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>; Espanyol won 3–0, with <a href="Luis%20Garc%C3%ADa%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29">Luis García</a> scoring the first goal at the ground, followed by a <a href="Ben%20Sahar">Ben Sahar</a> double. Six days later, Espanyol captain <a href="Daniel%20Jarque">Daniel Jarque</a> died from a <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a> aged 26 in the <a href="Florence">Florence</a> neighbourhood of <a href="Centro%20Tecnico%20Federale%20di%20Coverciano">Coverciano</a>, where the club was at the time after playing several fixtures in Italy. Since then, in the 21st minute – his former shirt number – of every Espanyol match, an ovation is made in his honour for a full minute.
After Pochettino left in 2012, the club maintained themselves in the top flight under a series of other managers. In January 2016, Chinese businessman Chen Yansheng took over the club by acquiring a 54% stake. In the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20La%20Liga">2018–19 season</a>, Espanyol finished 7th, thus returning to the Europa League for the first time since their final run in 2006–07. However, the club suffered relegation for the first time since 1994 the following season, after a 1–0 loss at Barcelona. On 3 August 2020 the club published an official statement urging La Liga to suspend relegation; nevertheless relegation was not avoided. Espanyol won promotion back to La Liga at the first attempt on 8 May 2021 following a 0–0 draw against <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>, with four matches to spare in the 42-game season.
Since 2022, Espanyol has achieved a strategic cooperation with LEYU SPORTS. And LEYU became Official Asian Partner of RCDE. On 28 May 2023, Espanyol relegated to the Segunda División after two seasons in La Liga.
Rivalries.
"El derbi barceloní".
In the first half of the 20th century during the <a href="Dictatorship%20of%20Primo%20de%20Rivera">Miguel Primo de Rivera dictatorship</a> (1923–1930), FC Barcelona was seen as a symbol of <a href="Catalans">Catalan</a> identity. This contrasted with RCD Espanyol which cultivated a kind of compliance with the central authority. 
In 1918, the municipalities of Catalonia promoted a campaign to ask the Spanish Government for a <a href="Statute%20of%20Autonomy%20of%20Catalonia">Statute of Autonomy</a>.
FC Barcelona joined that request and the Catalan press recognized FC Barcelona as a major cultural arm of the Catalan independence movement. The city's other team, RCD Espanyol, dissociated itself from the claim due to the former's success on the European stage.
Today FC Barcelona is the club that is closer to the political powers in Catalonia. Its last presidents have linked the club with the <a href="Catalan%20independence">Catalan independence movement</a> and the holding of a referendum, even though this causes discomfort among some Catalan fans and those in the rest of Spain who feel neglected and think the team is biased against them. Although some of RCD Espanyol's directors have expressed pro-independence stances, the club stays out of politics. It is believed that most of the team's fans are against the independence of Catalonia.
On numerous occasions RCD Espanyol has complained of unfavourable and sometimes directly offensive treatment towards the club in favour of FC Barcelona by some Catalonian public media like <a href="TV3%20%28Catalonia%29">TV3</a>.
Despite these differences in ideology, the "derbi" (derby) has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than those of Barcelona (who hold <a href="El%20Cl%C3%A1sico">El Clásico</a> in higher regard instead) due to the difference in objectives.
Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the league table, Espanyol has only managed to finish above Barça on three occasions in almost 70 years and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 victory in 1951.
Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against FC Barcelona during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">season</a>.
Espanyol lost 0–1 to FC Barcelona on 8 July 2020, to be relegated to the Segunda División.
Stadium.
From 1923 until 1997, Espanyol played their home games in <a href="Sarri%C3%A0%20Stadium">Estadi de Sarrià</a> in the <a href="Sarri%C3%A0-Sant%20Gervasi">Sarrià-Sant Gervasi</a> district of Barcelona. In 1997, they moved to the <a href="Estadi%20Ol%C3%ADmpic%20Llu%C3%ADs%20Companys">Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys</a> on <a href="Montju%C3%AFc">Montjuïc</a>. For the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Espanyol moved into the newly constructed <a href="RCDE%20Stadium">RCDE Stadium</a> (also known as Estadi Cornellà-El Prat) between <a href="Cornell%C3%A0%20de%20Llobregat">Cornellà de Llobregat</a> and <a href="El%20Prat%20de%20Llobregat">El Prat de Llobregat</a>.

Notes
Historical departments of RCD Espanyol.
Until the 1990s, Espanyol had several sporting sections. In March 2017, the Association of Supporters and Shareholders of RCD Espanyol boosted a project for recovering the sporting sections of the club, but this time without any economic link with the football team. The new multi-sports club was created with the name of <a href="SD%20Espanyol">Seccions Deportives Espanyol</a> ("Sporting sections Espanyol").
Two months later, the association confirmed that Espanyol would start competing in the 2017–18 season, with a <a href="roller%20hockey">roller hockey</a> team and women's volleyball teams. In the next season, the basketball section was refounded and a new section of handball would be created.

RCD Mallorca

Real Club Deportivo Mallorca, <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">S.A.D.</a> (, , "Royal Sporting Club Mallorca"), commonly known as Real Mallorca or just Mallorca, is a Spanish professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Palma%20de%20Mallorca">Palma</a> on the <a href="Mallorca">island of Mallorca</a> in the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>. Founded on 5 March 1916, they currently compete in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, holding home games at the <a href="Estadi%20Mallorca%20Son%20Moix">Estadi Mallorca Son Moix</a> with a 23,142-seat capacity.
The club had its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, reaching a best-ever third place in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20La%20Liga">1999</a> and <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20La%20Liga">2001</a> and winning the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> in <a href="2003%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20final">2003</a> following final defeats in <a href="1991%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20final">1991</a> and <a href="1998%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20final">1998</a>. Mallorca also won the <a href="1998%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">1998 Supercopa de España</a> and reached the <a href="1999%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20final">1999 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final</a>.
Mallorca traditionally play in red shirts with black shorts and socks.
History.
The early years.
Founded on 5 March 1916, what would later become RCD Mallorca was registered at the Spanish Football Federation under the name of Alfonso XIII Foot-Ball Club.
Weeks after its establishment, the club wasted little time forming the directors of Alfonso XIII FBC, headed by engineer Adolfo Vázquez Humasqué and eight other football fans. Their first stadium, the Buenos Aires field, was inaugurated with a competitive fixture against FC Barcelona just 20 days after registering further fast-tracked development. Despite the fixture ending in a disappointing 8–0 defeat, it was not long before King Alfonso XIII himself requested the royal adoption of ‘Real’ in the team's title, therefore becoming Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII Foot-Ball Club.
In 1917, the Catalan Federation granted Real Sociedad Alfonso XIII admission into the second-tier league championship as an unofficial champion of the Balearic Islands. Booking a place in the final, Los Bermellones went on to record their first title with a resounding 3–1 victory over Futbol Club Palafrugell, in Barcelona.
Until the 1930s, the board of directors managed to organise fixtures against peninsular clubs such as RCD Espanyol and Real Murcia, while also hosting rare exhibitions against foreign sides including: Ajax in 1923, Uruguay's national team in 1925, Chilean outfit Colo-Colo in 1927 and one of the Czech Republic's oldest teams, Prague Meteor, in 1930.
In 1931, following the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic which prohibited any form of reference to monarchy, the club was renamed to Club Deportivo Mallorca.
Although major fixtures and competitions across Spain were soon interrupted by the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936, the squad enjoyed a highly successful spell by winning every possible championship they entered into, as football on the island remained resistant to the deferral experienced throughout the country. When the war finally ended, matches with teams from the Peninsula were quick to resume and the Second Division was inaugurated, based on five groups of eight teams each.
It was during a period in the Second Division that, on 22 September 1945, the time had come to wave goodbye to Buenos Aires Field and up sticks to Es Fortí, a 16,000-maximum capacity stadium which would be called home for over half a century and undergo several expansions. A line-up featuring forward Sebastián Pocoví, defender Saturnino Grech and goalkeeper Antoni Ramallets beat Jerez 3–0 on the opening game of the new campaign the following day, with Carlos Sanz scoring Es Fortí's first goal in front of packed-out terraces. The title Es Fortí was short-lived however, with the board later changing the name of the stadium to Lluís Sitjar, in honour of the man who had driven the construction of the field.
During the 1949–1950 season, the Balearic club recovered their "Real" title, becoming Real Club Deportivo Mallorca
1990s and 2000s: Peak.
In <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1990–91</a>, Mallorca reached the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> <a href="1991%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">final</a> for the first time, losing by one goal to <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>.
Argentine <a href="H%C3%A9ctor%20C%C3%BAper">Héctor Cúper</a> was hired as manager in 1997. In his first season, the club reached the <a href="1998%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1998 Copa del Rey Final</a>, and lost on penalties to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> after a 1–1 draw in <a href="Mestalla">Mestalla</a>. However, as Barcelona also won the league, Mallorca were their opponents in the <a href="1998%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">1998 Supercopa de España</a> and won 3–1 on aggregate for their first major honour. Barcelona's double also meant Mallorca entered the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>, the final staging of the tournament – they lost the <a href="1999%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">final</a> 2–1 to Italy's <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">S.S. Lazio</a> at <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a>.
In 1999, Mallorca also finished a best-ever 3rd and qualified for the first time to the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, but were eliminated on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a> by <a href="Molde%20FK">Molde FK</a> of Norway before the group stage. <a href="Luis%20Aragon%C3%A9s">Luis Aragonés</a> matched 3rd place in 2001, before leaving for an <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> still in the second tier. On 28 June 2003, Mallorca won the Copa del Rey with a 3–0 win over <a href="Recreativo%20de%20Huelva">Recreativo de Huelva</a> in the <a href="2003%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">final</a> in <a href="Elche">Elche</a>; the goals were scored by <a href="Walter%20Pandiani">Walter Pandiani</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Eto%27o">Samuel Eto'o</a> (two).
2010s: Decline and return.
Mallorca was relegated from La Liga on the last day of the 2012–13 season. In January 2016, with the team at risk of relegation to the third tier, American investor <a href="Robert%20Sarver">Robert Sarver</a> and former <a href="NBA">NBA</a> player <a href="Steve%20Nash">Steve Nash</a> bought the club for just over €20 million.
On 4 June 2017, Mallorca fell into the third tier for the first time since 1981, with one game of the season still to play. A year later, they bounced back in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2017–18 season</a> after winning the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">play-off</a> final against <a href="CF%20Rayo%20Majadahonda">CF Rayo Majadahonda</a>, under new manager <a href="Vicente%20Moreno">Vicente Moreno</a>. In June 2019, Mallorca secured a second consecutive promotion to the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20La%20Liga">2019–20 La Liga</a>, following a 3–2 win on aggregate over <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a> in the <a href="2019%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20play-offs">2019 Segunda División play-offs</a> – having lost the first game 2–0.

UE Lleida

Unió Esportiva Lleida was a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Lleida">Lleida</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. It was founded as "Lérida Balompié-AEM" on 30 October 1939, and became "Unión Deportiva Lérida" in 1947, after a merger with "CD Leridano". It held home matches at "<a href="Camp%20d%C2%B4Esports">Camp d´Esports</a>", with a 13,500-seat capacity. It was dissolved in 2011. The soul of the club was reformed as <a href="Lleida%20Esportiu">Lleida Esportiu</a>.
Lleida adopted the <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a> version of its name in 1978. The club spent most of its history in the lower divisions, but in the early 1950s and early 1990s, the club won promotion to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>.
During the 1990s the club was managed by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Esnal">Mané</a>, <a href="Juande%20Ramos">Juande Ramos</a> and <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Mu%C3%B1oz">Víctor Muñoz</a>, all of whom subsequently became successful managers with other clubs. From 1987 the club organised its own summer trophy, the <a href="Ciutat%20de%20Lleida%20Trophy">Ciutat de Lleida Trophy</a>.
History.
Early Lleida football clubs.
Football was first introduced to <a href="Lleida">Lleida</a> in 1910 by Manuel Azoz, a <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> business man. Among the earliest clubs in the city were "Montserrat", founded in 1913 by <a href="Marist%20Brothers">Marist Brothers</a>, and "FC Lleida" founded in 1914. Both played their early games in the district of Pla d’en Gardeny. In 1915, the "Associació Cultural Lleidatana" was founded by <a href="Catalan%20nationalism">Catalan nationalists</a>.
By 1917 two other clubs, "Club Colonial" and , began playing at the Camp de Mart. In 1918 "FC Joventut" was formed by <a href="Young%20Republican%20Left%20of%20Catalonia">left-wing Catalan republicans</a> and during the 1920s they emerged as the city’s strongest side.
In 1919, Lleida became the first club to use the "<a href="Camp%20d%C2%B4Esports">Camp d´Esports</a>", but this team was dissolved in 1927. Other clubs of the 1920s included "AE Lleida Calaveres", "Lleida Sport Club" and "AEM Lleida", all of which disappeared during the 1930s.
Lérida Balompié and CD Leridano.
After the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, former members of "AE Lleida Calaveres", "Lleida Sport Club" and "AEM Lleida" formed "Lérida Balompié-AEM". After playing in regional leagues for four seasons they made their debut in the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">fourth division</a> in 1943. The following year, the club split into two clubs, "Lérida Balompié" and "AEM".
Meanwhile, in 1941 Spanish nationalists formed "CD Leridano", and a local rivalry developed between that club and "Lérida Balompié". On March 9, 1947, these two sides merged to become "Unión Deportiva Lérida". The new team retained both the blue and white colours and club shield of "Lérida Balompié", the first president of the new club being Eduard Estadella.
First golden era.
"UD Lérida" enjoyed a golden age in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when they progressed from the third to the <a href="La%20Liga">first division</a> in just three seasons. In 1949, they won the third-tier and, the following season, 1949–50, they made their debut in "<a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>".
In the 1949–50 season the club achieved their biggest league victory in their history with a 9–2 win against <a href="CD%20Lugo">CD Lugo</a>, along with finishing second in the league achieving promotion to the topflight for the first time ever. However, during <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20La%20Liga">its debut season</a>, it was heavily defeated on several occasions: 9–0 to <a href="CD%20M%C3%A1laga">CD Málaga</a>, 10–1 to <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a> and 10–0 to <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>, being ultimately relegated back. Lleida's first eleven in the first division was: Rivero, Rigau, Telechea, Carrillo, Esquerda, Roca, Gausí, Pellicer, Ramón, Bidegain and Fustero.
The Mané era.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lleida enjoyed a second solid moment, under coach <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Esnal">Mané</a>. He joined the club in 1988 and took it from "<a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>" to "La Liga".
<a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20La%20Liga">1993–94</a> was the second topflight experience for the club; in spite of a 1–0 win over the <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> "Dream Team" at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a>, and another against <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, 2–1 at home, Lleida only won seven times altogether and was relegated once again.
The <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1994–95 season</a> saw the club finish third in the second division, with a subsequent promotion play-off defeat against <a href="Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n">Sporting de Gijón</a>. In 2001, the team returned to level three and, in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2004–05</a> and <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the following campaign</a>, played again in the second division. From 1996 and during an entire decade (with some interruptions), legendary player <a href="Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Rubio%20Buedo">Miguel Ángel Rubio</a> served as its manager.
Liquidation.
On 10 May 2011, Lleida was placed in a liquidation auction due to a <a href="Euro">€</a>28 million debt. On 12 July, the team's seat was acquired by local entrepreneur Sisco Pujol, with the new club being named <a href="Lleida%20Esportiu">Lleida Esportiu</a>.

Valencia CF

Valencia Club de Fútbol (; ), commonly referred to as Valencia CF (or simply Valencia) is a Spanish professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>, Spain, that currently plays in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, the top flight of the <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish league system</a>. Valencia was founded in 1919 and has played its home games at the 49,430-seater <a href="Mestalla%20Stadium">Mestalla</a> since 1923.
Valencia has won six <a href="La%20Liga">Spanish League</a> titles, eight <a href="Spanish%20Cup">Copa del Rey</a> titles, one <a href="Spanish%20Super%20Cup">Supercopa de España</a>, and one <a href="Copa%20Eva%20Duarte">Copa Eva Duarte</a>. In European competitions, they have won two <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>s, one <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, one <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>, two <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>s, and one <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a>. They also reached two <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> finals in a row (<a href="2000%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2000</a> and <a href="2001%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2001</a>). Valencia were also members of the <a href="G-14">G-14</a> group of leading European football clubs and since its end has been part of the original members of the <a href="European%20Club%20Association">European Club Association</a>. In total, Valencia have reached seven major European finals, winning four of them.
Historically one of the biggest clubs in the world in terms of number of associates (registered paying supporters), with around 50,000 season ticket holders at their peak, the club began to decline in the mid-2010s. Singaporean billionaire <a href="Peter%20Lim">Peter Lim</a> acquired the team in 2014.
Over the years, the club has achieved a global reputation for their prolific youth academy, or ""Acadèmia"." Products of their academy include world-class talents such as <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Albiol">Raúl Albiol</a>, <a href="Gianni%20Lorenzo%20Valenti">Gianni Lorenzo Valenti</a>, <a href="Javier%20Farinos">Javier Farinos</a>, <a href="David%20Albelda">David Albelda</a>, <a href="Vicente%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Vicente Rodríguez</a>, <a href="Gaizka%20Mendieta">Gaizka Mendieta</a>, <a href="David%20Silva">David Silva</a>, and <a href="Juan%20Mata">Juan Mata</a>.

History.
The club was established on 5 March 1919 and officially approved on 18 March 1919, with Octavio Augusto Milego Díaz as its first president; incidentally, the presidency was decided by a <a href="coin%20toss">coin toss</a>. The club played its first competitive match away from home on 21 May 1919 against Valencia Gimnástico, and lost the match 1–0.
Valencia moved into the <a href="Mestalla%20Stadium">Mestalla Stadium</a> in 1923, having played its home matches at the Algirós ground since 7 December 1919. The first match at Mestalla pitted the home side against Castellón Castalia and ended in a 0–0 draw. In another match the day after, Valencia won 1–0 against the same opposition. Valencia CF won the Regional Championship in 1923, and was eligible to play in the domestic <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> cup competition for the first time in its history.
1940s: Emergence as a giant in Spanish football.
The <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> halted the progress of the Valencia team until 1941, when it won the Copa del Rey, beating <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">RCD Espanyol</a> in the final. In the 1941–42 season, the club won its first Spanish <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> championship title, although winning the Copa del Rey was more reputable than the championship at that time. The club maintained its consistency to capture the league title again in the 1943–44 season, as well as the 1946–47 league edition. They would conclude their decade of success by winning the 1949 Copa del Rey; this meant Valencia ended the decade with a record of three La Liga and two Copa del Rey titles. This success would help cement the club's name in Spanish football.
In the 1950s, Valencia failed to emulate the success of the previous decade, even though it grew as a club. A restructuring of Mestalla resulted in an increase in spectator capacity to 45,000, while the club had a number of Spanish and foreign stars. Players such as <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spanish international</a> <a href="Antonio%20Puchades">Antonio Puchades</a> and <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> forward <a href="Faas%20Wilkes">Faas Wilkes</a> graced the pitch at Mestalla. In the 1952–53 season, the club finished as runners-up in La Liga, and in the following season, won the Copa del Rey, then known as the Copa del Generalísimo.
1960s: European successes in the Fairs Cup.
While managing average league form in the early 1960s, Valencia had its first European success in the form of the <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> (the forerunner to the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>), defeating <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the final of the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1961–62 edition</a>. The <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">following edition</a> of the tournament pitted Valencia against <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>n club <a href="GNK%20Dinamo%20Zagreb">Dinamo Zagreb</a> in the final, which the Spanish side also won. Valencia reached a third consecutive Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final in the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">following season</a>, but this time were defeated 2–1 by fellow Spanish club <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>.
1970s to early 1980s: More Domestic and European glory.
Former two-time <a href="European%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">European Footballer of the Year</a> award winner <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a> was hired as Valencia coach in 1970, and immediately inspired his new club to their fourth La Liga championship and first since 1947. This secured Valencia its first qualification for the prestigious <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>, contested by the various European domestic champions. Valencia reached the third round of the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20European%20Cup">1971–72 competition</a> before losing both legs to <a href="Hungary">Hungarian</a> champions <a href="%C3%9Ajpesti%20D%C3%B3zsa">Újpesti Dózsa</a>. In 1972 the club also finished runners-up both in La Liga and the domestic cup, losing to Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid, respectively. The most notable players of the 1970s era include <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n midfielder <a href="Kurt%20Jara">Kurt Jara</a>, forward <a href="Johnny%20Rep">Johnny Rep</a> of the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="Argentina">Argentinian</a> forward <a href="Mario%20Kempes">Mario Kempes</a>, who was consecutively <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">La Liga top scorer</a> in 1976–77 and 1977–78. Valencia would go on to win the Copa del Rey again in the 1978–79 season, and also capture the <a href="European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> the next season, after beating <a href="England">English</a> club <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the final, with Kempes spearheading their success in Europe.
Mid to late 1980s: Stagnation and relegation.
In 1982, the club appointed <a href="Miljan%20Miljani%C4%87">Miljan Miljanić</a> as coach. After a disappointing season, Valencia was in 17th place and faced <a href="relegation">relegation</a> with seven games left to play. Koldo Aguirre replaced Miljanić as coach, and Valencia barely avoided relegation that year, relying on favorable results from other teams to ensure their own survival. In the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, the club was heavily in debt under the presidency of Vicente Tormo. The club finally hit rock bottom when it was <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> at the end of the 1985–86 season, and riven with internal problems such as unpaid player and staff wages, as well as poor morale. The club was relegated for the first time after 55 years in Spanish top-flight football.
Arturo Tuzón was named the new club president, and he helped steer Valencia back to La Liga. <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a> returned as coach in 1986 and Valencia won <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> again following the 1986–87 season. Di Stéfano stayed on as coach until the 1987–88 season, when the team finished in 14th position in La Liga. <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>n forward <a href="Luboslav%20Penev">Luboslav Penev</a> joined the club in 1989, as Valencia aimed to consolidate their place in La Liga. In the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20La%20Liga">1988–89 La Liga</a> season, Valencia finished third, which would signal their competitiveness going into the 1990s.
1990s: Re-emergence.
In the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20La%20Liga">1989–90 La Liga</a> season, Valencia finished as runners-up to Real Madrid, and thus qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>.
<a href="Guus%20Hiddink">Guus Hiddink</a> was appointed as head coach in the 1991–92 season, and the club finished fourth in the League and reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. In 1992, Valencia officially became a Sporting Limited Company, and retained Hiddink as their coach until 1993.
<a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian coach <a href="Carlos%20Alberto%20Parreira">Carlos Alberto Parreira</a>, fresh from winning the <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1994 FIFA World Cup</a> with the <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil national team</a>, became manager at Mestalla in 1994. Parreira immediately signed Spanish goalkeeper <a href="Andoni%20Zubizarreta">Andoni Zubizarreta</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n forward <a href="Oleg%20Salenko">Oleg Salenko</a>, and <a href="Predrag%20Mijatovi%C4%87">Predrag Mijatović</a>, but failed to produce results expected of him. He was replaced by new coach José Manuel Rielo. The club's earlier successes continued to elude it, although it was not short of top coaching staff like <a href="Luis%20Aragon%C3%A9s">Luis Aragonés</a> and <a href="Jorge%20Valdano">Jorge Valdano</a>, as well as foreign star forwards like Brazilian <a href="Rom%C3%A1rio">Romário</a>, <a href="Claudio%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28footballer%29">Claudio López</a>, <a href="Ariel%20Ortega">Ariel Ortega</a> from Argentina, and <a href="Adrian%20Ilie">Adrian Ilie</a> from Romania. In the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20La%20Liga">1995–96 La Liga</a> season, Valencia finished second to <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, being unable to capture the title after a close fought race.
Valencia would struggle for the next two seasons, but the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20La%20Liga">1998–99 La Liga</a> season would signal the start of one of the club's most successful periods in their history; they lifted their first trophy in nineteen years by winning the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1998–99 Copa del Rey</a> under <a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a>, and also qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>.
2000s: Valencia returns to the top of Spanish and European football.
Valencia started the 1999–2000 season by winning another title, beating <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the <a href="1999%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Spanish Super Cup</a>. Valencia finished third in the league, four points behind champions <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo La Coruña</a>, and level on points with second-placed Barça. The biggest success for the club, however, was in the Champions League; for the first time in its history, Valencia reached the <a href="European%20Champion%20Clubs%27%20Cup">European Cup</a> final. However, in the <a href="2000%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">final</a> played in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> on 24 May 2000, <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> would beat Valencia 3–0.
The final would also be Claudio López's farewell, as he had agreed to sign for Italian side <a href="SS%20Lazio">Lazio</a>; also leaving was Farinós for <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> and Gerard for Barcelona. The notable signings of that summer were <a href="John%20Carew">John Carew</a>, <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Baraja">Rubén Baraja</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Ayala">Roberto Ayala</a>, <a href="Vicente%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Vicente Rodríguez</a>, and Brazilian left-back <a href="F%C3%A1bio%20Aur%C3%A9lio">Fábio Aurélio</a>. That season Valencia also bought <a href="Pablo%20Aimar">Pablo Aimar</a> in the winter transfer window. Baraja, Aimar, Vicente, and Ayala would soon become a staple of Valencia's dominance of the early 2000s in La Liga.
Valencia started the championship on the right foot and were top of the league after ten games. After the Christmas break, however, Valencia started to pay for the top demand that such a draining competition like the Champions League requires. After passing the two mini-league phases, <a href="H%C3%A9ctor%20C%C3%BAper">Héctor Cúper</a>'s team eliminated English sides <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the quarter-finals and <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C">Leeds United</a> in the semi-finals, reaching the <a href="2001%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">final</a> for the second year in a row. In the final match against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, played in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> at the <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a> on 23 May, <a href="Gaizka%20Mendieta">Gaizka Mendieta</a> gave Valencia the lead by scoring from the penalty spot right at the start of the match. Goalkeeper <a href="Santiago%20Ca%C3%B1izares">Santiago Cañizares</a> then stopped a penalty from <a href="Mehmet%20Scholl">Mehmet Scholl</a>, but <a href="Stefan%20Effenberg">Stefan Effenberg</a> drew Bayern level after the break thanks to another penalty. After extra time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out, where a <a href="Mauricio%20Pellegrino">Mauricio Pellegrino</a> miss gave Bayern Champions League glory and dealt Valencia a second-straight defeat in the final. Valencia went on to slip to fifth place in La Liga and out of the Champions League positions for the 2001–02 season. Going into the final league match, Valencia only needed a draw at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> against Barcelona to seal Champions League qualification. However, "Los Che" lost to Barcelona 3–2, with a last minute goal completing a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> from <a href="Rivaldo">Rivaldo</a>, resulting in Barcelona qualifying for the Champions League ahead of their side.
Valencia president D. Pedro Cortés resigned due to personal reasons and left the club in July, with the satisfaction of overseeing the club win the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup, as well as reaching two successive Champions League finals. D. Jaime Ortí replaced Cortés as president and expressed his intention of maintaining the good form that had made the club so admired on the European circuit. There were also some changes in the team and staff. <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a>, after helping <a href="CD%20Tenerife">Tenerife</a> to promotion, replaced Héctor Cúper after the latter became the new coach at Inter in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. Among the playing squad, <a href="Gaizka%20Mendieta">Gaizka Mendieta</a>, <a href="Didier%20Deschamps">Didier Deschamps</a>, <a href="Luis%20Milla%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201966%29">Luis Milla</a>, and <a href="Zlatko%20Zahovi%C4%8D">Zlatko Zahovič</a> left, while <a href="Carlos%20Marchena">Carlos Marchena</a>, <a href="Mista%20%28footballer%29">Mista</a>, <a href="Curro%20Torres">Curro Torres</a>, <a href="Francisco%20Rufete">Francisco Rufete</a>, <a href="Gonzalo%20de%20los%20Santos">Gonzalo de los Santos</a>, and <a href="Salva%20Ballesta">Salva Ballesta</a> all arrived.
From 1999 up until the end of the 2004 season, Valencia had one of their most successful periods in the club's history. With a total of two La Liga titles, a <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, a Copa del Rey, and a UEFA Super Cup in those six years, no less than five first class titles and two Champions League finals had been achieved.
That first match against fellow title rivals Real Madrid produced a significant and important victory. This was followed by a record of eleven consecutive wins, breaking their existing record set in the 1970–71 season, which was also the club's La Liga title won under <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a>.
After a defeat in <a href="A%20Coru%C3%B1a">A Coruña</a> against <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo</a> on 9 December 2001, the team had to win against <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">Espanyol</a> at the <a href="Estadi%20Ol%C3%ADmpic%20Llu%C3%ADs%20Companys">Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys</a> to prevent falling further behind the league leaders. Valencia were 2–0 down at half-time, but a comeback in the second half saw them win 3–2.
In the second part of the season, Benítez's team suffered a small setback after losing 1–0 at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu</a> to Real Madrid, but they recovered from this defeat and achieved four victories and two draws in their following six matches.
In one of these crucial games against Espanyol, Valencia were trailing 1–0 at half-time and down a player as well following the dismissal of Carboni. However, after a second half brace from <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Baraja">Rubén Baraja</a>, they would achieve a 2–1 comeback win. Furthermore, Real Madrid's defeat at the <a href="Anoeta%20Stadium">Anoeta</a> to <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a> left Valencia with a three-point lead at the top of the table.
Valencia's final game of the season was on 5 May 2002 at <a href="La%20Rosaleda">La Rosaleda</a> against <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20CF">Málaga</a>, a day that has gone down in Valencia's history. The team shut itself away in <a href="Benalm%C3%A1dena">Benalmádena</a>, close to the scene of the game, in order to gain focus. An early goal from <a href="Roberto%20Ayala">Roberto Ayala</a> and another close to half-time from <a href="F%C3%A1bio%20Aur%C3%A9lio">Fábio Aurélio</a> secured Valencia a fifth La Liga crown, 31 years after their last title win.
The 2002–03 season was a disappointing one for Valencia, as they failed in their attempt to retain the La Liga title and ended up outside of the Champions League spots in fifth, behind <a href="RC%20Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta Vigo</a>. They were also knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Inter Milan on away goals. The 2003–04 season saw Valencia trailing longtime leaders Real Madrid. In February, with 26 matches played, Madrid were eight points clear at the top of the table. However, their form severely declined in the late stage of the season, and consecutive losses in their last five games of the campaign allowed Valencia to overtake them and claim the title, their second in three seasons. The club also added the UEFA Cup to this success, defeating <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a> 2–0 in the <a href="2004%20UEFA%20Cup%20final">final</a>.
In the summer of 2004, manager Benítez decided to depart Valencia, stating he had had problems with the club president; he would soon become head coach of <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. He was replaced by former Valencia coach <a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a>, who had recently been sacked by <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. His second reign at the club was a disappointment, however, as Valencia harboured realistic hopes of retaining their La Liga crown but, by February, found themselves in seventh place. Valencia had also been knocked out of the Champions League group phase, with Ranieri being sacked promptly in February. The 2004–05 season ended with Valencia outside of the UEFA Cup spots.
In the summer of 2005, <a href="Getafe%20CF">Getafe</a> coach <a href="Quique%20Flores">Quique Flores</a> was appointed as the new manager of Valencia and ended the season in third place, which in turn gained Valencia a place in the Champions League after a season away from the competition. The 2006–07 season was one with many difficulties; a campaign which started with realistic hopes of challenging for the title was disrupted with a huge list of injuries to key players, as well as internal arguments between Flores and new sporting director <a href="Amedeo%20Carboni">Amedeo Carboni</a>. Valencia ended the season in fourth place and were knocked out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Chelsea 3–2 on aggregate, after they had knocked out Italian champions Inter in the second round. In the summer of 2007, the internal fight between Flores and Carboni was settled, with Carboni being replaced by Ángel Ruiz as the new sporting director of Valencia.
On 29 October 2007, the Valencia board of directors fired Flores after a string of disappointing performances, and caretaker manager <a href="%C3%93scar%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20%28football%20manager%2C%20born%201974%29">Óscar Fernández</a> took over on a temporary basis until a full-time manager was found, rumoured to be either <a href="Marcello%20Lippi">Marcello Lippi</a> or <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a>. A day later, Dutch manager <a href="Ronald%20Koeman">Ronald Koeman</a> announced he would be leaving <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV Eindhoven</a> to sign for Valencia. However, Koeman's appointment failed to lead to improvement; in fact, Valencia even went on to drop to the 15th position in the league, just two points above the relegation zone. Despite their poor league form, Valencia would still go on to lift the Copa del Rey on 16 April 2008, following a 3–1 victory over Getafe at the <a href="Vicente%20Calder%C3%B3n%20Stadium">Vicente Calderón</a>. This was the club's seventh Copa title. Five days later, one day after a devastating 5–1 league defeat in Bilbao, Valencia fired Koeman and replaced him with <a href="Voro%20%28footballer%29">Voro</a>, who would guide Valencia as caretaker manager for the remainder of the season. He went on to win the first match since the sacking of Koeman, beating <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a> 3–0. Voro would eventually drag Valencia from the relegation battle to a safe mid-table finish of tenth place, finally ending a disastrous league campaign for "Los Che".
Highly rated <a href="Unai%20Emery">Unai Emery</a> was announced as the new head coach of Valencia on 22 May 2008. The start of the young manager's career looked to be promising, with the club winning four out of its first five games, a surge that saw the team rise to the top position of the La Liga table. Despite looking impressive in Europe, "Los Che" then hit a poor run of form in the league that saw them dip as low as seventh in the standings. Amid the slump emerged reports of a massive internal debt at the club exceeding 400 million euros, as well as that the players had been unpaid for weeks. The team's problems were compounded when they were knocked out of the UEFA Cup by <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a> on away goals. After a run where Valencia took only five points from ten games in La Liga, an announcement was made that the club had secured a loan that would cover the players' expenses until the end of the year. This announcement coincided with an upturn in form, and the club won six of its next eight games to surge back into the critical fourth place Champions' League spot. However, "Los Che" were then pushed down to sixth place in the league following defeats to top four rivals <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> and <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a> in two of their final three games, meaning they failed to qualify for the Champions League for a second successive season.
2010-2014: Debt issues and stability.
No solution had yet been found to address the massive debt Valencia was faced with, and rumors persisted that top talents such as <a href="David%20Villa">David Villa</a>, <a href="Juan%20Mata">Juan Mata</a>, and <a href="David%20Silva">David Silva</a> could leave the club to help balance the books. In the first season of the new decade, Valencia returned to the Champions League for the first time since the 2007–08 campaign, as they finished comfortably in third place in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20La%20Liga">2009–10 La Liga</a> standings. However, in the summer of 2010, due to financial reasons, David Villa and David Silva were sold to Barcelona and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, respectively, to reduce the club's massive debt. Despite the loss of two of the club's most important players, the team was able to finish comfortably in third place again in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20La%20Liga">2010–11 La Liga</a> for the second season running, although they would be eliminated from the Champions League by German side <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> in the round of 16. In the summer of 2011, then-captain Juan Mata was sold to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> to further help Valencia's precarious financial situation. It was announced by club president Manuel Llorente that the club's debt had been decreased and that the work on the new stadium would restart as soon as possible, sometime in 2012.
During the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Valencia%20CF%20season">2012–13 season</a>, <a href="Ernesto%20Valverde">Ernesto Valverde</a> was announced as the new manager, but after failing to qualify for the Champions League, he stepped down and was replaced by <a href="Miroslav%20%C4%90uki%C4%87">Miroslav Đukić</a>. On 5 July 2013, <a href="Amadeo%20Salvo">Amadeo Salvo</a> was named as the new president of the club. Almost a month after Salvo was named president, on 1 August, Valencia sold star striker <a href="Roberto%20Soldado">Roberto Soldado</a> to English club <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> for a reported fee of €30 million. Đukić was sacked six months into the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Valencia%20CF%20season">2013–14 season</a> after just six wins in his first sixteen matches, Valencia's worst start to a season in fifteen years. He was replaced by <a href="Juan%20Antonio%20Pizzi">Juan Antonio Pizzi</a> on 26 December 2013. Under Pizzi, Valencia reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>, where they lost to eventual winners <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> on away goals, and finished eighth in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> despite a disastrous start to the season.
2014-present: Peter Lim's ownership.
In May 2014, Singaporean businessman <a href="Peter%20Lim">Peter Lim</a> was designated by the Fundación Valencia CF as the buyer of 70.4% of the shares owned by the club's foundation. After months of negotiations between Lim and <a href="Bankia">Bankia</a> (the main creditor of the club), an agreement was reached in August 2014. Juan Antonio Pizzi was unexpectedly sacked as head coach and replaced by <a href="Nuno%20Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Nuno Espírito Santo</a> on 2 July 2014. Later, Salvo revealed in an interview that hiring Nuno was one of the conditions Lim had insisted on when buying the club. This raised eyebrows in the media because of Nuno's close relationship with the football agent <a href="Jorge%20Mendes">Jorge Mendes</a>, whose first-ever client was Nuno. Lim and Mendes were also close friends and business partners. Regardless, Nuno's first season was a successful one. Notable signings included <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Negredo">Álvaro Negredo</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gomes">André Gomes</a> and <a href="Enzo%20P%C3%A9rez">Enzo Pérez</a>, who had just won the <a href="LPFP%20Primeira%20Liga%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Player of the Year</a> in the <a href="Primeira%20Liga">Portuguese Primeira Liga</a>. Valencia finished the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20La%20Liga">2014–15 season</a> in fourth place, achieving Champions League qualification with 77 points, just one point ahead of Sevilla after a dramatic final week where they defeated <a href="Granada%20CF">Granada</a> 4–0.
On 2 July 2015, Amadeo Salvo resigned from his post as the executive president of Valencia, citing personal reasons. He was a popular figure among the fans. On 10 August 2015, <a href="Nicol%C3%A1s%20Otamendi">Nicolás Otamendi</a> was sold to Manchester City for £32 million and <a href="Aymen%20Abdennour">Aymen Abdennour</a> was signed from <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a> for £22 million as his replacement. Valencia defeated Monaco in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League play-off round</a> with a 4–3 aggregate victory. However, Valencia had a poor start to the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20La%20Liga">2015–16 league season</a>, winning only five out of thirteen matches and failing to progress from the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20group%20stage">Champions League group stage</a>. The fans were also increasingly concerned about the growing influence of Jorge Mendes in the club's activities. On 29 November, Nuno resigned as manager and former <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> defender <a href="Gary%20Neville">Gary Neville</a> was hired as his replacement on 2 December. Valencia went winless for nine matches before earning their first win under Neville in a 2–1 victory at home against Espanyol. On 30 March 2016, Neville was sacked after recording the lowest win percentage in La Liga history for a Valencia manager with minimum of five matches, winning just three out of sixteen games. He was replaced by <a href="Pako%20Ayestar%C3%A1n">Pako Ayestarán</a>, who had been brought in by Neville as the assistant coach just one month prior. Valencia finished the season in twelfth place.
In the summer of 2016, André Gomes and <a href="Paco%20Alc%C3%A1cer">Paco Alcácer</a> were both sold to Barcelona and <a href="Shkodran%20Mustafi">Shkodran Mustafi</a> was sold to Arsenal, while <a href="Ezequiel%20Garay">Ezequiel Garay</a> and former <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> player <a href="Nani%20%28footballer%29">Nani</a> were brought in. Pako Ayestarán was sacked on 21 September 2016 after four straight defeats at the beginning of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Valencia%20CF%20season">2016–17 season</a>. Former <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy national team</a> head coach <a href="Cesare%20Prandelli">Cesare Prandelli</a> was hired as his replacement on 28 September. However, he resigned after just three months on 30 December, claiming the club had made him false transfer promises. Days later, on 7 January 2017, Valencia sporting director <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Pitarch">Jesús García Pitarch</a> also resigned, saying he felt like he was being used as a shield for criticism by the club and that he could not defend something he no longer believed in. <a href="Salvador%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20Marco">Voro</a> was named caretaker manager for the fifth time until the end of season, with Valencia in 17th position and in danger of relegation. However, results improved under Voro and he steered Valencia clear off relegation, ultimately finishing the season in 12th place. On 27 March, Mateu Alemany was named the new director general of Valencia.
The club also announced club president Lay Hoon Chan had submitted her resignation and that she would be replaced by Anil Murthy. After rumors arose of Lim's attempts at selling the club, Murthy assured the fans and local media that Valencia was a long-term project for both him and Lim, and they would not consider selling the club. For the following season, former Villarreal coach <a href="Marcelino%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Toral">Marcelino</a> was named the new manager on 12 May.
After a successful first season under Marcelino, the club secured fourth place in La Liga and a return to the Champions League. In Marcelino's second season, Valencia again finished fourth and also reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>. On 25 May 2019, Valencia won the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, their first trophy since 2008, upsetting league winners Barcelona 2–1 in the <a href="2019%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20final">final</a>.
Both Marcelino and sporting director <a href="Mateu%20Alemany">Mateu Alemany</a>, who were credited as the architects of this success, were fired on 11 September 2019 after the former publicly criticized Lim. He was replaced by the ultimately unsuccessful <a href="Albert%20Celades">Albert Celades</a>, who was sacked due to poor results, while sporting director <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20S%C3%A1nchez">César Sánchez</a> resigned that same season, making it six different managers and another six sporting directors by 2020.
For the 2020–21 season, manager <a href="Javi%20Gracia">Javi Gracia</a> was hired. He was put in charge of a team full of prospects and reserves after the club failed to sign any players during the summer transfer window, but sold key players such as captain <a href="Dani%20Parejo">Dani Parejo</a>. Local wonderkid <a href="Ferran%20Torres">Ferran Torres</a> was also sold to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> for a price deemed half his market value. Overall, Valencia sold players worth 85 million euros in order to rebalance the club's books. At the beginning of the season, the club was unable to pay the salaries to the remaining players. After six seasons under <a href="Peter%20Lim">Peter Lim</a>'s ownership, Valencia had accumulated losses of 323 million euros, while the value of his biggest investment company, Thomson Medical Group, lost 1.7 billion euros during the same six-year period. Following those years of mismanagement, the playing squad was cut significantly in terms of quality and Lim's ownership has faced strong criticism in Valencia.
In the 2021–22 season, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bordal%C3%A1s">José Bordalás</a> was hired as head coach, following his five-season tenure with Getafe. Valencia reached the <a href="2022%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20final">Copa del Rey final</a> final in Bordalás' first season in charge, but lost to <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> on penalties following a 1–1 draw.
Stadium.
Valencia played its first years at the Algirós stadium, but moved to the <a href="Mestalla%20Stadium">Mestalla</a> in 1923. In the 1950s, the Mestalla was restructured, which resulted in a capacity increase to 45,000 spectators. Today it holds 49,430 seats, making it the fifth largest stadium in Spain. It is also renowned for its steep terracing and for being one of the most intimidating atmospheres in Europe.
On 20 May 1923, the Mestalla pitch was inaugurated with a friendly match between Valencia and <a href="Levante%20UD">Levante UD</a>.
A long history has taken place on the Mestalla field since its very beginning, when the Valencia team was not yet in the <a href="La%20Liga">Primera División</a>. Back then, this stadium could hold 17,000 spectators, and at that time, the club started to show its potential in regional championships, which led the managers of the time to carry out the first alterations of Mestalla in 1927. The stadium's total capacity increased to 25,000 before it became severely damaged during the Civil War; the Mestalla was used as a concentration camp and a junk warehouse. It would only keep its structure, since the rest was a lonely plot of land with no terraces and a stand broken during the war. Once the Valencian <a href="Pitch%20%28sports%29">pitch</a> was renovated, the Mestalla stadium in which the team managed to bring home their first title in 1941.
During the 1950s, the Valencia ground experienced the deepest change in its whole history. That project resulted in a stadium with a capacity of 45,500 spectators, that eventually saw destruction by a <a href="1957%20Valencia%20flood">flood in October 1957</a> that arose from the overflowing of the <a href="Turia%20River">Turia River</a>. Nevertheless, the Mestalla not only returned to normality, but also some more improvements were added, like artificial light, which was inaugurated during the 1959 <a href="Fallas">Fallas</a> festivities.
During the 1960s, the stadium kept the same appearance, while the <a href="urban%20area">urban</a> view around it was quickly being transformed. Moreover, the ground held its first European matches, with <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> being the first foreign team to play at the Mestalla, on 15 September 1961.
From 1969, the expression "Anem a Mestalla" ("Let's go to the Mestalla"), so common among the supporters, began to fall into oblivion. The reason of this was due to a proposed name change of the stadium to honor Luis Casanova Giner, the club's most successful president. Giner admitted he was completely overwhelmed by such honour, but requested in 1994 that the original name of Mestalla remained.
In 1972, the head office of the club, located in the back of the numbered terraces, was inaugurated. It consisted of an office of <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> style with a trophy hall, which held the founding flag of the club. In the summer of 1973, more goal seats, which meant the elimination of fourteen rows of standing <a href="Terrace%20%28stadium%29">terraces</a>, were added to provide comfort. Club management also considered the possibility of moving the Mestalla from its present location, to land on the outskirts of the town, before deciding against it.
Mestalla also hosted the <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spain national football team</a> for the first time in 1925. It was chosen as the national team's group venue when Spain staged the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 FIFA World Cup</a>, and at the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Summer Olympics</a> held in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. All of Spain's matches up to the final were held at Mestalla, as they won Gold. Mestalla has been the setting for important international matches, has held several Cup finals, and has also been the home of Levante. The ground also provided a temporary home for <a href="CD%20Castell%C3%B3n">Castellón</a> and <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> for European games due to stadium development.
New stadium.
The 2008–09 season was due to be the last season at the Mestalla, with the club intending to move to their new 75,000-seater stadium <a href="Nou%20Mestalla">Nou Mestalla</a> in time for the 2009–10 season. However, due to the club being in financial crisis, work on the new stadium has been heavily delayed.
Club identity.
Kit.
Originally, Valencia's kit was composed of white shirts, black shorts and socks of the same colour. Through the years, however, these colours have alternated between white and black. The away kit has been shades of orange in recent years while third alternate kits have featured colors from the club crest—yellow, blood orange and blue.
The team have also attracted smaller, local sponsors over the years. One example is <a href="Lamiplast">Lamiplast</a>, a Valencia-based furniture company.
Anthem.
To celebrate the club's 75th anniversary the then president Arturo Tuzón commissioned Pablo Sánchez Torella to compose an anthem for the club. This was a "<a href="pasodoble">pasodoble</a>" whose lyrics were later written by Ramón Gimeno Gil in the <a href="Valencian%20language">Valencian language</a>. The anthem had its official presentation on the anniversary of the club on 21 September 1993.
Crest.
Valencia and the Balearic Islands were conquered by King <a href="James%20I%20of%20Aragon">James I of Aragon</a> during the first half of the 13th century. After the conquest, the King gave them the status of independent kingdoms of whom he was also the king (but they were independent of Aragonese laws and institutions). The arms of Valencia show those of James I.
The unique crowned letters "L" besides the shield were granted by <a href="Peter%20IV%20of%20Aragon">Peter IV</a>. The reason for the letters was that the city had been loyal twice to the King, hence twice a letter "L" and a crown for the king.
There are several possible explanations for the bat; one is that bats are simply quite common in the area. The second theory is that on 9 October 1238, when James I was about to enter the city, re-conquering it from the Moors, a bat landed on the top of his flag, which he interpreted as a good omen. Following his victory, the bat were then added to the coat of arms.
In May 2013, it was reported that <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> had started a legal case against the club, claiming that the new bat image design was too similar to <a href="Batman">Batman</a>. The club issued a statement clarifying that it had intended to use a revised version of its bat logo for a line of casual clothing and applied for permission from the <a href="European%20Union%20Intellectual%20Property%20Office">Office of Harmonisation of the Internal Market</a> but the application was dropped after DC Comics filed an "objection", not a lawsuit. DC Comics again filed a complaint with the EU's office of IP opposing the trademark application made by Valencia for its <a href="centennial">centennial</a> logo, claiming there is likely to be confusion with its <a href="Batman">Batman</a>’s symbol.

Europa's home games are played at the "<a href="Nou%20Sardenya">Nou Sardenya</a>", with a capacity of 4,000 seats.
In 2021, Europa became the first club in Catalonia to declare itself formally against <a href="racism">racism</a>, <a href="fascism">fascism</a>, <a href="sexism">sexism</a>, and <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a> after a voting by the club members to change the statutes. Later, the club started initiatives and actions to realize its ideals.
Europa lived its glory period in the <a href="1920s">1920s</a>. In 1918-19, the club achieved promotion to the highest division of Catalan football, the <a href="Catalan%20football%20championship">Campionat de Catalunya</a>. In 1922-23, Europa was crowned champions of Catalonia after beating <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> in a tiebreaker in <a href="Girona">Girona</a>. This triumph gave the club the right to participate in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, where Europa ended as the runner-up after losing to <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Club</a> in the final.
The club is best known for its <a href="association%20football">football</a> team who in <a href="1929%20La%20Liga">1929</a>, along with city neighbours <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> and <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">RCD Espanyol</a>, were among the 10 founder members of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>.

The following glory era would be the <a href="1960s">1960s</a>, when Europa played five consecutive seasons in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>. On three occasions, Europa won the <a href="Copa%20Catalunya">Copa Catalunya</a>: in 1997 and 1998 by beating <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> in the final and in 2015 by doing the same with <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona FC</a>.
Europa's good reputation, especially in the 1920s, made it attractive for many international teams to play against the club. For example, Europa has competed in friendlies with teams like <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">FC Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City FC</a>, <a href="FC%20Porto">FC Porto</a>, <a href="NAC%20Breda">NAC Breda</a>, <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a>, <a href="Estudiantes%20de%20La%20Plata">Estudiantes de La Plata</a>, <a href="Montpellier%20HSC">Montpellier HSC</a>, <a href="Udinese%20Calcio">Udinese Calcio</a>, <a href="Legia%20Warsaw">Legia Warsaw</a>, and <a href="AC%20Sparta%20Prague">AC Sparta Prague</a>.
The club also has one of the oldest basketball teams in Spain, and on the 8th of December 1922, Europa played <a href="Laiet%C3%A0%20BC">Laietà BC</a> in the first-ever organised basketball game played in Spain (won 8-2 by Europa).

The colours.
From the foundation in 1907 to 1918, Europa's players were dressed in a shirt with white and blue vertical stripes and blue shorts. In 1918, the shirt became fully white, except for a blue collar. In 1926, Europa started playing with a white shirt and a blue <a href="Chevron%20%28insignia%29">chevron</a>, which has become one of the primary symbols of the club. Even though the motive is unsure, the most accepted theory is that the shirt has been inspired by that of Birmingham City FC, a team that had visited Barcelona some years earlier.
During the 2007-08 season, the season of the club's centenary, the shirt design changed to one that included the blue chevron and the blue collar.
The socks used to be black or another dark colour until 1955 (all teams used to do this until this year), after which white socks were alternated with black/dark ones. Between 1961 and 2007, Europa's socks were white, and since the year of the centenary, the socks have always been blue.
The crest.
The current crest, which has been modernised over the decades, appeared for the first time in 1915. It substituted a crest that had been the club's symbol since 1907. The author of the new logo was Jacint Olivé Font, a local artist and a player for Europa. The crest reflects two of the most characteristic objects in football: a ball and a goal. In the superior area, blue and white stripes still remind us of the first shirt design of Europa. In the middle, the initials of the club can be read.

Stadium.
Nou Sardenya.
Europa plays its home matches in the "<a href="Nou%20Sardenya">Nou Sardenya</a>", opened on the 1st of December 1940 and completely rebuilt in 1995. The building is located in the <a href="Vila%20de%20Gr%C3%A0cia">Vila de Gràcia</a>, between the streets of Sardenya (from which it has its name), Camèlies, and Pau Alsina. It has a capacity of 4,000, artificial grass, and dimensions 100x63 meters.
Camp de l'Àliga.
Since 2001, Europa manages the <a href="Camp%20de%20l%27%C3%80liga">Camp de l'Àliga</a>, a municipality-owned stadium built in 1991 in the <a href="Gr%C3%A0cia">District of Gràcia</a>, in the neighborhood of <a href="Vallcarca%20i%20els%20Penitents">Vallcarca i els Penitents</a>. This allowed the club to expand the football school and increase the number of teams in the youth academy. The field used to be made out of dirt, but has artificial grass since 2004.
Previous fields.
Throughout the years, Europa has played its home matches in many different fields in Barcelona. Out of all of them, the <a href="Camp%20del%20Guinard%C3%B3">Camp del Guinardó</a> was the most important and representative one.
History.
Source:
Origins.
Club Esportiu Europa was founded on the 5th of June 1907, after the fusion between two modest clubs in the city, "Provençal FC" and "Madrid de Barcelona FC". After the impossibility to register a new club in the <a href="Catalan%20Football%20Federation">Catalan Football Federation (FCF)</a> due to the high entrance fee, the founding members decided to pay off the debts of a small club named "Europa FC", which was a cheaper option, and kept the name. The foundational act occurred in the already disappeared <a href="Bar%20Bodega">bar bodega</a> La Roca, at the Carrer de Sicília, 290, in Barcelona.
1900s and 1910s. The first steps.
In 1909, Europa made its first appearance in the second division of the <a href="Catalan%20football%20championship">Catalan Championship</a>, drawing 4-4 against <a href="UE%20Sant%20Andreu">UE Sant Andreu</a>. In 1913-14, 1914-15, and 1915-16, the club participated in the <a href="Playoffs">promotion playoffs</a>, but without any success.
In 1917-18, Europa dropped to the third division after a league restructuring. This situation did not last long, as the club achieved promotion in 1917-18 and 1918-19, reaching the first division of Catalan football.
1920s. The golden decade.
During the 1920s, Europa would live its most glorious years. The club turned <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> into the second strongest club in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, under <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> and above <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">RCD Espanyol</a>. In both 1920-21 and 1921-22, the club finished as runner-up in the Catalan Championship before winning the title in 1922-23 under the English coach <a href="Conyers%20Kirby">Ralph Kirby</a>. After finishing level on points with <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, they then beat them 1–0 in a tiebreaker in the <a href="Camp%20de%20Vista%20Alegre">Camp de Vista Alegre</a>, <a href="Girona">Girona</a>. At that time, Europa was also the second Catalan football club with the most members: 6,000, and disposed over more sections than just football.
Subsequently, Europa was the representative team of Catalonia in the <a href="1923%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1923 Copa del Rey</a>, competing with the champions from other parts of <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. Until the creation of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in 1928, the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> was the most prestigious championship in Spain. Europa defeated <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla FC</a> in the quarterfinals (4-0 and 1-2) and <a href="Sporting%20Gij%C3%B3n">Sporting de Gijón</a> in the semifinals (3-2 and 1-2). In the <a href="1923%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey final</a> at the <a href="Camp%20de%20Les%20Corts">Les Corts</a> stadium, the club lost 1–0 to <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>. According to the local press, Europa hit the post twice and was the dominant team.
Europa finished as runners-up in the <a href="Football%20in%20Catalonia">Campionat de Catalunya</a> again in 1923-24, 1926-27, 1927-28 and 1928-29.
In 1928, Europa was invited as one of the 10 teams participating in the <a href="1929%20La%20Liga">first edition</a> of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> as one of the finalists of the Copa del Rey. The club made its debut in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> against <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid CF</a>, losing 5-0. One week later, Europa received <a href="Arenas%20Club%20de%20Getxo">Arenas Club de Getxo</a> in Barcelona and won 5-2, thanks to the competition's first pure hat-trick by <a href="Manuel%20Cros">Manuel Cros</a>. During this season, the club beat Real Madrid (5-2) and Athletic Club at home, finally finishing 8th. Europa spent three seasons in the Primera División: <a href="1929%20La%20Liga">1929</a>, <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20La%20Liga">1929-30</a> and <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20La%20Liga">1930-31</a>. After the last season, they were relegated to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>.
1930s. A severe crisis.
In 1931, Europa merged with <a href="Gr%C3%A0cia%20FC">Gràcia FC</a>, formerly known as <a href="FC%20Espanya%20de%20Barcelona">FC Espanya de Barcelona</a>, in order to survive economically. This crisis was caused by the high costs of participation in La Liga and the rise of <a href="Professionalism%20in%20association%20football">professionalism</a>. The fusion club received the name of Catalunya FC. However, the merger was not a success. During the <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1931/32</a> season, Catalunya FC, with three games to go, was unable to complete their fixture list due to an accumulation of debts. Moreover, the club finished last in the Catalan Championship. As a result, the 15 games they had played in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> were cancelled, and the team was put back to the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>. In the summer of 1932, this team ceased to exist.
During the same 1931-32 season, some members of Europa who did not support the fusion maintained an amateur team under the same identity as the Europa from before. This way, the spirit of the club managed to survive after the disappearance of Catalunya FC. Slowly and carefully, the club was rebuilt in the lowest division of Catalan football. The directors acquired a stadium, were able to compose a team, and, most importantly, secured the continuance of the club. In 1935-36, Europa almost achieved promotion to the first division of the Catalan Championship.
After the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, football in Catalonia continued, despite the difficulties. During this period, the club reached the first division of Catalan football. In 1939, its stadium suffered too much damage and could not be used anymore. After the war, the new authorities cancelled all the results of the competitions played during the war, meaning that Europa returned to the second division.
In 1939-40, the club ended 2nd in the second tier but had no option to compete for promotion to the first tier, as the regional championships were dissolved to create regional divisions within the <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football pyramid</a>. Until 1940, the regional and national championships functioned independently. Between 1939 and 1940, Europa played its home games in the stadiums of other local teams, like <a href="FC%20Martinenc">FC Martinenc</a>, <a href="UE%20Sant%20Andreu">UE Sant Andreu</a>, and <a href="UE%20Sants">UE Sants</a>.
1940s. Playing in the regional leagues.
After the disappearance of the Catalan Championship, Europa was placed in the Primera A for the 1940-41 season, a competition directly inferior to the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>. The team's results were not good enough and led to relegation. However, there were also positive developments, such as the opening of the Sardenya stadium in 1940. 
After two seasons in the Primera B, Europa returned to the Primera A, maintaining their place in this competition between 1943 and 1951.
1950s. Debut in the Tercera División.
In 1950-51, Europa played a marvellous season and achieved promotion to the Tercera División, the third tier of Spanish football at the time. Between 1951 and 1961, the club stayed up without too much trouble, even attempting to achieve promotion to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> on some occasions.
1960s. Promotion to the Segunda División.
After ten seasons in the middle of the table, Europa was crowned champions in 1961-62. However, the club missed out on promotion after losing the playoffs final to <a href="UP%20Langreo">UP Langreo</a>. In 1962-63, the luck was on Europa's side, and the team went up to the second division after beating <a href="UD%20Mah%C3%B3n">UD Mahón</a> (4-0 and 2-2) and <a href="Caudal%20Deportivo">Caudal Deportivo</a> (1-1 and 6-2). 
Europa participated for five consecutive seasons in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, between 1963 and 1968. During these years, considered the second golden era of the club, Europa's best season was <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1963-64</a> when they finished third, very close to promotion to the <a href="La%20Liga">Primera División</a>. Another remarkable feat was beating <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a> with "los Cinco Magníficos" in the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo">1966-67 Copa del Rey</a>, even though the Aragonese team was the defending champion. During the same season, Europa ended on a notable 6th place in the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>.
A league restructuring in 1967-68, reducing the number of groups in the Segunda División from two to one, put Europa back in the <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>.
1970s and 1980s. Difficult times.
After the relegation, Europa played some good seasons in the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> and was close to returning to the second tier. Nevertheless, from <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1971-72</a> onwards, the results worsened significantly, and in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1973-74</a>, the club was even relegated to the <a href="Regional%20Preferent">Regional Preferent</a>. These were tough times for the club, only returning to the Tercera División in 1977.
After the promotion, Europa finished many seasons in the lower part of the classification and could not avoid a second relegation to the highest regional league in 1986. Again, it would take three years to go up to the Tercera División. 
During the 1985-86 season, Europa changed its official name from the Spanish "Club Deportivo Europa" to the Catalan "Club Esportiu Europa."
1990s. Winning two Copes Catalunya.
Upon returning to the Tercera División in <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1989-90</a>, Europa played a promising season and even competed for promotion to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>, which had become the third category of Spanish football in 1977. However, during following seasons, the club finished in lower places on the table.
Moreover, between 1992 and 1995, Europa had to play its home matches outside of its stadium. The <a href="Municipality%20of%20Barcelona">Municipality of Barcelona</a>, owner of the ground on which the stadium was built, decided to completely reconstruct the building. The renovation started with the construction of an underground parking lot, after which the installation of stands, a field, a swimming pool, and a sports complex next to the football field was realized. Moreover, the stadium disposes of artificial grass and all facilities that modern stadiums require. In the meanwhile, Europa played its home games at the stadiums of <a href="FC%20Martinenc">FC Martinenc</a> and <a href="UA%20Horta">UA Horta</a>.
Despite the difficulties, Europa's results during the construction period improved. In <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1993-94</a>, the club finished 4th and participated in the playoffs for promotion to the Segunda División B, in which they achieved that goal after a close battle with <a href="CD%20Rold%C3%A1n">CD Roldán</a> from <a href="Region%20of%20Murcia">Murcia</a>, <a href="CD%20Montu%C3%AFri">CD Montuïri</a> from <a href="Mallorca">Mallorca</a>, and <a href="Pinoso%20CF">Pinoso CF</a> from <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencia</a>.
The <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">1994-95 season</a> in the bronze category was, from a purely results-based perspective, horrible. Europa could not compete with other teams with a higher budget and did not dispose of its own stadium. The club was relegated to the Tercera División.
On the other hand, the supporters of Europa celebrated the (re)opening of the Sardenya stadium, renamed to <a href="Nou%20Sardenya">Nou Sardenya</a>, on the 4th of May 1995. It was too late to contribute to the battle against relegation (as a matter of fact, Europa would only start to use the new stadium in the next season), but it turned out to be a boost for the club in the following years. On the 15th of August 1995, coinciding with the <a href="Festa%20Major%20de%20Gr%C3%A0cia">Festa Major de Gràcia</a>, Europa made its debut in the new stadium. The friendly match against <a href="UE%20Lleida">UE Lleida</a> turned out to be the first edition of the <a href="Trofeu%20Vila%20de%20Gr%C3%A0cia">Trofeu Vila de Gràcia</a>. 
After the inauguration of the Nou Sardenya, the club qualified for the promotion playoffs in the Tercera División in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1995-96</a>, <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1996-97</a>, <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1998-99</a>, and <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2000-01</a>, without achieving its goal. In the meanwhile, more editions of the Trofeu Vila de Gràcia were organised, which turned into an annual tradition. Furthermore, the football school of Europa was established during these years, a school that would grow every year.
The most remarkable feat of this decade is, without a doubt, the amazing results in the <a href="Copa%20Catalunya">Copa Catalunya</a> in 1997 and 1998, in which Europa beat teams like <a href="CE%20Sabadell%20FC">CE Sabadell FC</a>, <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">RCD Espanyol</a>, and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> to conquer two trophies.
In the 1996-97 season, Europa knocked out Sabadell (1-0) and Espanyol (0-0) in the semifinals played at the <a href="Estadi%20de%20la%20Nova%20Creu%20Alta">Nova Creu Alta</a> (the draw between Sabadell and Espanyol placed Europa for the final). In the final, played in the stadium of <a href="CE%20L%27Hospitalet">CE L'Hospitalet</a>, Europa defeated the first team of <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> by 3-1 in a historic match. At that moment, <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">FC Barcelona</a> was the champion of the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>.
In the 1997-98 season, Europa repeated something that was deemed irrepetible. In the semifinal, played at the Nou Sardenya, the team won against Espanyol (2-0). In the final, disputed in FC Barcelona's <a href="Mini%20Estadi">Mini Estadi</a>, Europa faced "Barça" yet again and drew 1-1, winning the penalty series (3-4). <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">FC Barcelona</a> had won the national double that season, but could not beat Europa.
2000s. Growth in all aspects.
During the first decade of the new century, Europa finished in discrete places in the Tercera División, close to relegation. In <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2003-04</a>, the team suffered a dropdown, but returned to the Tercera División one year later, after which the team finished in some mid-table positions.
Since 2001, Europa has witnessed a growth on many levels. The youth academy kept on growing until reaching a number of over 30 teams, facilitated by the opening of a second stadium: the <a href="Camp%20de%20l%27%C3%80liga">Camp de l'Àliga</a>. Also in 2001, the women's team was created, as well as many new fan groups. Moreover, Europa presented its own website (2001), television channel (2003), radio channel (2008), and newspaper (2010). Meanwhile, the club recovered its <a href="basketball">basketball</a> and <a href="futsal">futsal</a> sections, even though these would disappear rapidly.
During the 2007-08 season, Europa celebrated its <a href="Centennial">centenary</a>. One of the many festivities was the celebration of a friendly game against <a href="CA%20Osasuna">CA Osasuna</a> in the Nou Sardenya, which ended 1-2 in favor of the <a href="Navarre">Navarrese</a>.
2010s and 2020s. Boost of results and fanbase.
By 2012, Europa started playing strong seasons in the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>, after many years of mediocre results. The club qualified four times in a row for the playoffs for promotion to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>, which could be achieved after surviving three rounds against teams from other groups.
In <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2012-13</a>, Europa ended 3rd in the league. In the first round of the playoffs, Europa was paired with <a href="Arandina%20CF">Arandina CF</a> from <a href="Castile%20and%20Le%C3%B3n">Castile and León</a>. Europa lost 0-1 at home and 2-0 away, being knocked out.
In <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2013-14</a>, Europa ended 3rd again. In the first round of the playoffs, the club beat <a href="UD%20Mutilvera">UD Mutilvera</a> from <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a> (1-0 and 0-0), but was defeated in the second round by <a href="UD%20Socu%C3%A9llamos">UD Socuéllamos</a> from <a href="Castilla%E2%80%93La%20Mancha">Castile-La Mancha</a> (0-0 and 2-0).
In <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2014-15</a>, the club finished 3rd again, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to <a href="Jerez%20CF">Jerez CF</a> from <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> (1-0 and 2-0).
In <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2015-16</a>, Europa ended 3rd for the fourth time in a row. In the first round of the playoffs, Europa was beaten by <a href="San%20Fernando%20CD">San Fernando CD</a> from <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> (1-1 and 2-3).
However, there was also good news. Europa won a third edition of the <a href="Copa%20Catalunya">Copa Catalunya</a> in <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Copa%20Catalunya">2014–15</a>, after beating <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona FC</a> in the final by 2-1. This final was won in the <a href="Nou%20Sardenya">Nou Sardenya</a>, which allowed many supporters to witness this historic night.
After four similar seasons, Europa's results worsened in the following years, alternating high and low classifications. The <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2019-20</a> season started promising, as Europa was one of the contenders for the title, but was interrupted by the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. The regular season was suspended and the fourth highest-placed teams, including Europa, were placed in a small tournament for promotion. Europa lost 1-0 to <a href="Terrassa%20FC">Terrassa FC</a>. 
In 2020-21, Europa was more successful. The unusual season (still affected by the pandemic) resulted in a title for the club. The team achieved direct promotion to the new <a href="Segunda%20Federaci%C3%B3n">Segunda División RFEF</a>, the new fourth tier of <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football</a>. <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">2021-22</a> did not transpire as Europa hoped. It turned out to be a tough competition and resulted in relegation for the club. The next season, however, finished positively. The first men's team returned to the <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20Segunda%20Federaci%C3%B3n">Segunda Federación</a>, the <a href="CE%20Europa%20%28women%29">first women's team</a> achieved promotion to the <a href="Primera%20Federaci%C3%B3n%20%28women%29">Primera Federación</a>, the men's reserve team achieved promotion to the <a href="Lliga%20Elit">Lliga Elit</a>, and the first U-19 team achieved promotion to the <a href="Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Honor%20Juvenil%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol">División de Honor</a>. Moreover, in 2023, Europa announced more than a doubling of the number of club members (to 1,800) and broke the attendance record.
Women's team.
Since 2001, Europa has a women's team, and during later years, more and more girl's teams have been created in the club's youth academy. The first women's team is active in the <a href="Primera%20Federaci%C3%B3n%20%28women%29">Primera Federación</a>, the second division of national football. This way, the women's team is Europa's highest-placed senior team.
Youth academy.
Youth academy and football school.
The first steps in the development of the youth academy were taken in 1991 when a football school independent form the club was created. Given the good results (both in the league and economically speaking), the school was incorporated in the club three years later. The opening of the <a href="Nou%20Sardenya">Nou Sardenya</a>, the <a href="Camp%20de%20l%27%C3%80liga">Camp de l'Àliga</a>, and the implementation of artificial grass in the latter stimulated the growth of the youth academy.
Currently, Europa manages a total of 46 teams, 16 of which are registered under the Private Sports Foundation Europa, an entity linked to the club, without any difference in functioning.
Reserve team.
In 2002, Europa reached an agreement with <a href="UE%20Caprabo">UE Caprabo</a> in the <a href="Segona%20Catalana">Primera Regional</a>, converting this club in the reserve team of Europa. The club's name changed to UE Caprabo Europa B, but maintained its distinctive identity. The first notable success was the promotion to the <a href="Primera%20Catalana">Primera Catalana</a> in 2006.
Even though it seemed that the club would be integrated entirely in the structure of Europa, the collaboration stopped in 2007, coinciding with a relegation. Later, UE Caprabo was absorbed by <a href="AE%20Josep%20Maria%20Gen%C3%A9">AE Josep Maria Gené</a>.
In 2012-13, <a href="CE%20Europa%20B">CE Europa B</a> was born, a reserve team that formed part of Europa from the beginning. The team started to compete in the <a href="Quarta%20Catalana">Quarta Catalana</a>, the lowest competition possible. In 2022-23, Europa B achieved promotion to the <a href="Lliga%20Elit">Lliga Elit</a>.
U-19 team.
The biggest success of the youth academy was the promotion of the first U-19 team to the highest division possible: the <a href="Divisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Honor%20Juvenil%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol">División de Honor</a>. Ever since, this team has alternated this competition and the <a href="Liga%20Nacional%20Juvenil%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol">Liga Nacional</a>, the second division of youth football.
Other sections.
In the 1920s, Europa was a multi sports club, as everything was still amateur of nature and the sportsmen were able to practice different sports. In this era, there was the section of <a href="Sport%20of%20athletics">athletics</a> (around 1920), <a href="basketball">basketball</a> (1922), <a href="hockey">hockey</a> (1925), and <a href="baseball">baseball</a>. The most noteworthy section was the first one, especially in Cross, which won a Catalan title. Moreover, Europa disposed over a <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a> section (1930), the section with the shortest life.
The crisis in 1931 caused the dissolution of all the others sections besides football, leaving Europa to be exclusively dedicated to this sport. In the 1990s, the club recovered the basketball section and created one for <a href="futsal">futsal</a>, but both disappeared quickly.
Basketball.
Europa played the first ever organised basketball match in Spain, on the 8th of December 1922 in the Camp del Carrer de Sicília, beating <a href="Laiet%C3%A0%20BC">Laietà BC</a> by 8-2. It was a successful era for the basketball team, winning the Catalan Championship on two occasions (1924 and 1926).

Trofeu Vila de Gràcia.
The <a href="Trofeu%20Vila%20de%20Gr%C3%A0cia">Trofeu Vila de Gràcia</a> is a friendly football tournament organised annually by Europa since 1995, which coincided with the inauguration of the <a href="Nou%20Sardenya">Nou Sardenya</a>. The tournament consists of one match between Europa's first men's team and an invited team. Generally, the friendly is played on the 15th of August, coinciding with the celebrations of the Festa Major de Gràcia and serving as the start of the footballing season of the club.
In 2003, the fan group <a href="Caliu%20Gracienc">Caliu Gracienc</a> organised a similar trophy for the first women's team: the <a href="Trofeu%20Caliu%20Gracienc">Trofeu Caliu Gracienc</a>. The tradition was lost in 2013 and recovered four years later, revived as the homonymous <a href="Trofeu%20Vila%20de%20Gr%C3%A0cia">Trofeu Vila de Gràcia</a>. This friendly tournament is usually held in the end of August or the beginning of September.
Media outlets.
Throughout the years, Europa has known many official publications, principally in the form of paper magazines, published since the 1950s. Since 2001, Europa created many digital media outlets.
Website.
The club's official website has been active since the 11th of November 2001, and publishes at least one post per day since 2003. Europa's official website was the first one in Spain to broadcast a live match, being considered one of the pioneers among official website of Spanish football clubs.
L'Escapvlat.
<a href="L%27Escapvlat">L'Escapvlat</a> is the official newspaper of the club. It has been published since February 2010, and in December 2023, it became a trimestral magazine. It only discusses club-related content and is distributed for free among members and supporters at many places throughout Barcelona. Its name derived from the nickname for Europa's players, "escapulats", a nickname based on the shirt of Europa (<a href="Chevron%20%28insignia%29">chevron</a> is "escapulari" in Catalan).
Other technologies.
Europa has known other online media outlets, such as Europa TV (started in 2003) and Europa Ràdio (2008). However, these channels disappeared after the growth in popularity of social media, such as <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="Instagram">Instagram</a>, and <a href="Twitter">X</a>, on which the club is currently also active.
Fan groups and fanbase.
Currently, Europa disposes over more than 1,800 members and 11 official fan groups. 
The number of Europa's fan groups has increased rapidly in the last decade, just like the member count doubled in 2021 and again in 2023.
Private Sports Foundation Europa.
The "Fundació Privada Esportiva Europa", or Private Sports Foundation Europa, is a non-profit organisation linked to Europa, dedicated to the social promotion of the club, constituted officially on the 10th of September 2003. The office is located in the <a href="Camp%20de%20l%27%C3%80liga">Camp de l'Àliga</a>.
Within the Foundation, different sports-related activities are promoted:

Arenas Club de Getxo

Arenas Club de Getxo is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football club</a> based in the town of <a href="Getxo">Getxo</a>, near <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a>. Founded in 1909, it currently plays in , holding home games at <a href="Campo%20Municipal%20de%20Gobela">Campo Municipal de Gobela</a>, with a 2,000-seat capacity. They were winners of the <a href="1919%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1919 Copa del Rey</a>, beating <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> 5–2.
It was among the pioneering clubs of Spanish football, and in 1928 was a founding member of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, alongside neighbouring <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>, <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a> and <a href="Real%20Uni%C3%B3n">Real Unión</a>. Only Real Unión has remained a consistent <a href="Basque%20football%20derbies">rival</a> since then due to both of their downfalls from the top flight.
History.
Origins of local football.
The area of <a href="Greater%20Bilbao">Greater Bilbao</a> was deeply connected to Britain due to its <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> mines and industry. Don Manuel, a priest in the local parish of the <a href="Las%20Arenas">Las Arenas</a> neighborhood, would gift balls to local children during <a href="Catechism">Catechism</a> lessons. Some of these boys would go on to study in England and learn about the local game of football. After their return to Getxo, they spread football to nearby neighborhoods.
By 1901, weekly matches were played in the fields of <a href="Lamiako%20%28Bilbao%20metro%29">Lamiako</a> by youth from Las Arenas. In 1903 the same group would win the "Copa Athletic", the biggest local tournament at the juvenile level, as well as play a match against <a href="Club%20Ciclista%20de%20San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">Club Ciclista de San Sebastián</a>, the precursor to <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>. They eventually founded a local team in 1909 (encouraged by the recent creation of the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Spanish Federation of Football Clubs</a>) with the name of "Arenas Football Club". It was renamed to "Club Arenas" three years later.
In 1914 they moved their home ground to the local sports club "Real Club Jolaseta" in the Neguri neighborhood.
Early successes.
In 1912 they started competing in the "Campeonato Norte" along with <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>, <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Racing de Santander</a>, <a href="Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n">Sporting de Gijón</a> and <a href="Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a>, being crowned champion in 1917. 
During the 1916-17 season of the "Campeonato", all the teams except for Arenas, Athletic, and <a href="Real%20Uni%C3%B3n">Real Unión</a> were suspended. The sporting committee of the tournament decided to play only the remaining matches between these three teams. Jolastokieta, one of the suspended teams, was dissolved that year. Arenas lost one match and won another against Unión as well as beating Athletic twice to claim the title. They then beat <a href="Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n">Sporting de Gijón</a> in the semifinals. This qualified them to <a href="1917%20Copa%20del%20Rey">that year's Copa del Rey</a>, where it reached the final in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, losing 1–2 against <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Madrid FC</a> after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a>. 
In 1917 a knock-out match in the Spanish Cup between Arenas and Athletic Bilbao had to be suspended after the <a href="Pitch%20invasion">pitch was stormed</a> by Athletic supporters who were looking to assault the referee for seeming biased against their team.
In 1919 Arenas won another regional competition, the "<a href="Biscay%20Championship">Campeonato de Vizcaya</a>", thus qualifying for the <a href="1919%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> again, and won the national tournament after defeating FC Barcelona 5–2 in <a href="1919%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">the final</a>, scoring three in extra time.

CE Sabadell FC

Centre d'Esports Sabadell Futbol Club, S.A.D. () is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Sabadell">Sabadell</a>, a city in the province of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the autonomous community of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. Founded in 1903, it plays in <a href="Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">Primera División RFEF</a> – Group 2, holding home games at "<a href="Estadi%20de%20la%20Nova%20Creu%20Alta">Estadi de la Nova Creu Alta</a>".
The side has competed in national leagues since 1928, gaining its first promotion to the Segunda División in 1933 and then the <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in 1944. Sabadell's longest spell in the top flight was from 1965 to 1972, and their most recent from 1986 to 1988. They have reached one <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> final, which they lost 3–0 to <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> in 1935.
By historical standards, CE Sabadell FC is the third best club in Catalonia, after <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> and <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">RCD Espanyol</a>.
History.
In 1901, Joan Saus and a group of youngsters from the Sabadell Catalan Centre founded "Centre d'Esports Sabadell", which became fully legalized on 5 June 1906. The club's first games were held in a grass field at Prat de Sant Oleguer but, on 3 June of that year, a stadium in the Creu Alta District was inaugurated, in a game against "Team X" from <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, later known as <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">RCD Espanyol</a>; in 1912, in the same site, the first game under floodlights was played in the country.
In 1933–34, the club won its first major trophy, the <a href="Copa%20Catalunya">Catalan Football Championship</a>, which allowed the winner to participate in the "<a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Presidente de la República</a>". During the former tournament, it won 15 games and drew once, reaching the latter's final in the following season, losing 0–3 to <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla FC</a> at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Chamartín Stadium</a>.
Sabadell first competed in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in the <a href="1943%E2%80%9344%20La%20Liga">1943–44 season</a>, finishing ninth. It improved to fifth in <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20La%20Liga">1946–47</a>, ranking in front of <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> and only four points behind champions <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia CF</a>, just one <a href="1945%E2%80%9346%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">season</a> after returning from <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>.
In <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20La%20Liga">1968–69</a>, Sabadell, guided by manager <a href="Pasieguito">Pasieguito</a>, finished a best-ever fourth as the top flight already consisted of 16 clubs. Subsequently, it <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">competed</a> in the <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>, losing to <a href="Club%20Brugge%20K.V.">Club Brugge K.V.</a> of <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> in the first round (3–5 on aggregate); in 1972, a seven-year ran in the top division came to an end, as the "Arlequinats" were <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20La%20Liga">relegated after finishing dead last</a>.
CE Sabadell became a <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">public limited sports company</a> in 1991, <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">being relegated</a> to <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> two years later, and immediately to <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> following severe economic problems. The club spent the following seventeen years in the third level (with the exception of <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2006–07</a> in the fourth).
In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2010–11 season</a>, Sabadell, managed by <a href="Llu%C3%ADs%20Carreras">Lluís Carreras</a>, won its group in the <a href="Season%20%28sports%29%23Regular%20season">regular season</a>. In <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20Play-Off">the playoffs</a>, the team drew both games against <a href="SD%20Eibar">SD Eibar</a>, but was eventually promoted on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a> following the 1–1 score at the <a href="Ipurua%20Municipal%20Stadium">Ipurua Municipal Stadium</a>, returning to the professional divisions after 18 years.
Sabadell struggled in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">their return to the second level</a> finishing in 19th place, being the first side in the relegation zone. However, they were spared when <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal CF</a> dropped down a division in the top flight, which led to the automatic relegation of its <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a> <a href="Villarreal%20CF%20B">Villarreal CF B</a>. Sabadell finished second level as 16th in 2012–13 season, as 10th in the 2013–14 season. Finally Sabadell finished it as 21st and relegated to third level after 4 years.
Sabadell had a lot of financial problems after the relegation to Segunda B. Japanese owner Keisuke Sakamoto, who had bought the club in 2012, sold it to Aragón-based company Viacron in 2015. Esteve Calzada, a former member of FC Barcelona board and a marketing expert whose company worked for Manchester City, bought the club in 2017. Since then, the club's debt has been restructured. Difficulties in finding a new investor meant that from 2017 to 2019 the club was more concerned with relegation avoidance than real hopes of promotion.
In August 2019, the Club announced an historical agreement with a group of international investors, whereby this Group would achieve majority ownership through periodic capital infusions over the following three years to guarantee institutional stability and financial resources to achieve sustainable success.
On 26 July 2020, the Club secured promotion to the La Liga Smartbank <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> by beating <a href="Barcelona%20B">Barcelona B</a> 2-1 in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> playoff final after five-years in third division. 
The team was immediately relegated in the following <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2020–21 season</a> by the narrow margin of one point, and joined the newly-created <a href="Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">1a RFEF Division</a>.
In 2021-22 Season, the team did not manage to make it to Playoffs by the margin of a single point.
Stadium.
Sabadell plays home games at <a href="Estadi%20de%20la%20Nova%20Creu%20Alta">Estadi de la Nova Creu Alta</a>. Inaugurated on 20 August 1967 with a 1–0 win against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, it has a capacity of 11,908 spectators.
Supporters.
The club has multiple supporter groups. Most groups have activities related to the social life of the members. For example, "THE WALKING ARLEKIN CLUB" has walking excursions during the season, usually before matches. There are also groups like "Honor 1903, La Força Arlequinada and" "Supporters Gol Nord", that focus more on the encouragement of the team, before, during and after the matches. Most of those groups usually concentrate in the northern stand at the Nova Creu Alta.
The club used to have a fan club called "Hooligans Vallès." They used to be a <a href="far%20right-wing">far right-wing</a> group which was established in 1993. In 2011, the group was disbanded as an official supporter group. In 2014, two fans were expelled from the Nova Creu Alta, after performing a <a href="Nazi%20salute">Nazi salute</a> during a match. However, in 2016, an unofficial <a href="Hebrews">Hebrew</a> supporter group was created, under the name "CE Sabadell Hebreu - סבאדל בעברית". The group provides news about the club in its Facebook and Twitter pages, for <a href="Israel">Israeli</a> and other <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>-speaking fans.
The fans have good relations with <a href="Bristol%20Rovers">Bristol Rovers</a>, which initially began due to several Rovers fans noticing that the local club had the same colours. They also have a friendship with "Gerunda Sud" of <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona FC</a>, and rivalries with "Desperdicis" of <a href="UE%20Sant%20Andreu">UE Sant Andreu</a>, "Penya Sport" of <a href="Palamos%20CF">Palamos CF</a> and "Rudes Lleida" of <a href="Lleida%20Esportiu">Lleida Esportiu</a>.
Anthem.
The official anthem of the club is "Honor al Sabadell", written by Lluís Papell to the music of Adolf Cabané. However, between 1983 and 1991 the club used "Sempre endavant Sabadell" as the official anthem, composed by Ramon Montlleó.

Real Jaén

Real Jaén Club de Fútbol, S.A.D. is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Ja%C3%A9n%2C%20Spain">Jaén</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. Founded in 1922 it plays in , holding home matches at "<a href="Nuevo%20Estadio%20de%20La%20Victoria">Nuevo Estadio de La Victoria</a>", with a capacity of 12,569 spectators. The club's biggest achievement has been playing 3 seasons in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, the Spanish top tier, during the 1950s.
History.
The club was founded in 1922 as Jaén Football Club and reconstituted in 1929 as Sociedad Olímpica Jiennense. They changed their name to Real Jaén Club de Fútbol in 1947. The team did not enroll in a national division until 1943 when it promoted to the <a href="Tercera%20Division">Tercera Division</a>. It immediately became a dominant team in the Spanish third division usually finishing in the top four.
After nine seasons in the Tercera Division, the "Lizards" were promoted to the <a href="Segunda%20Division">Segunda Division</a> in 1952. Their good form continued in the second division, as Real Jaén managed to win the <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20Segunda%20Division">1952–53 Segunda Division</a> group south, and managed to promote to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> for the first time ever. They won all of their home games that season including a 9–0 home win over fellow Andalusians <a href="Granada%20CF">Granada CF</a>.
During Real Jaén's first ever season in the Spanish top tier (<a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20La%20Liga">1953–54</a>) the team finished 14th with 11 wins, 6 draws, and 13 defeats, meaning they obtained 28 points. This meant the team would be placed in the relegation group along with <a href="CA%20Osasuna">CA Osasuna</a> and four teams from the Segunda Division. Jaén finished in last place with only one win and were relegated after just one season in the Spanish top flight.
Following their relegation from La Liga in 1954, key players departed from the team and Jaén finished in 7th place the following season. The next season was a lot better for Jaén. They managed to win the group South of Segunda Division, this time in the season 1955–56. This meant that La Liga again awaited the Real Jaén.
In their <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20La%20Liga">second top flight season</a>, Jaén barely avoided relegation, finishing 14th, one point above relegated <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a>. Jaén managed to stay in the Spanish elite. Their third top flight season was less successful and the team finished last with only 20 points collected. Real Jaén was relegated after two years in La Liga. The biggest highlight of the season was probably when Jaén managed a 1–0 home win over powerhouse <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>.
Following their second top flight relegation, Real Jaén never managed to compete for a return to the elite. Their best season was <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20Segunda%20Division">1959–60</a>, when the team managed a 3rd-place finish coming up two points behind the second placed <a href="Cordoba%20CF">Cordoba CF</a>, which qualified the team for the promotion playoffs. Following the 1962–63 season, the "Lizards" were relegated to the Tercera Division. This was the first time the team played there since 1952.
For the following 12 seasons, Jaén only made one return to the Segunda, in 1967, but were immediately relegated. They managed to return to the second tier in 1976 and remained there for three seasons until 1979 when they were relegated to the newly created <a href="Segunda%20Division%20B">Segunda Division B</a>, the new third tier in Spanish football. Jaén stayed in the third level until 1986, when the team was relegated to the Tercera Division, this time the fourth tier. They bounced between the Segunda B and the Tercera the following years.
In 1997, the team returned to the Segunda Division for the first time since 1979. The <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Segunda%20Division">1997–98 season</a> was bad however, as they finished last and went back to the Segunda B. Real Jaén managed to return to the Segunda in 2000. They achieved a 10th-place finish in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Segunda%20Division">2000–01 season</a>, but finished last the following season and were relegated again. The following 11 seasons were spent in the Segunda B, until 2013, when Jaén again returned to the Segunda. The "Lizards" finished second to last, in 21st place, meaning relegation followed again.
In 2017, Jaén finished 19th in the Segunda B, and were relegated to the Tercera Division for the first time since 1991.
Here, being in the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">4th level</a> of the Spanish football, the club finished 3rd in the 2017–18 season and remained in that category. On July 5, 2019, Real Jaén presented Alberto González as a new coach for the 2019–20 season.

CF Extremadura

Club de Fútbol Extremadura was a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Almendralejo">Almendralejo</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a>. Founded in 1924, it played two seasons in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, and held home games at "<a href="Estadio%20Francisco%20de%20la%20Hera">Estadio Francisco de la Hera</a>", with a capacity of 11,580 seats. The club folded in 2010 following several years of financial problems.
History.
Extremadura was founded in 1924, and spent the first 30 years of its existence in the regional leagues, promoting to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second division</a> after winning the regional championship in <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the third</a>.
The club lasted seven seasons in the category, finishing in fifth position in the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1958–59 season</a>. Subsequently, the following 29 years were spent in the third level – in 1977 it became the fourth, after the creation of <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> – with the addition of three relegations to the regional championships.
In 1990, after finishing first, Extremadura promoted to division three. Four years later, after <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">winning its group</a>, it returned to the second after an absence of 34 years; during that period of time, football in the region of <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> experienced a rise, with <a href="CD%20Badajoz">CD Badajoz</a> and <a href="CP%20M%C3%A9rida">CP Mérida</a> also competing in that level in the mid-1990s.
Extremadura finished in fifth position in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1995–96 campaign</a>. However, <a href="Real%20Madrid%20Castilla">Real Madrid Castilla</a> was ineligible for the playoffs, and Extremadura took its place, achieving promotion to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> for the first time ever after disposing of <a href="Albacete%20Balompi%C3%A9">Albacete Balompié</a> 2–0 on aggregate – Iosu Ortoundo was the manager.
<a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20La%20Liga">The first season in the top flight</a> was difficult as expected: the team lost its first nine matches and only won one of the first 19, but eventually recovered, finishing only one point from the safety zone. In <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the following year</a>, with a young <a href="Rafael%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafael Benítez</a> in charge, immediate promotion back was easily attained, as runner-up.
In the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20La%20Liga">1998–99 season</a> Extremadura finished in 17th position, and the second top flight campaign also ended in relegation, after losing in the playoffs against <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a>. The club's financial situation was precarious, and it dropped another division in 2002; in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">the first season in level three</a>, a fifth position meant a narrow miss in the subsequent promotion playoffs, and the following four years were also spent in the division, with the club never finishing higher than tenth.
After the <a href="Season%20%28sports%29">regular season</a> in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2006–07</a>, Extremadura faced <a href="UD%20P%C3%A1jara%20Playas%20de%20Jand%C3%ADa">UD Pájara Playas de Jandía</a> from the island of <a href="Fuerteventura">Fuerteventura</a> in the relegation playoffs: after a 0–3 away loss, a 1–1 home draw returned the club to the fourth division, after 17 years. Shortly afterwards it emerged that the club could not settle its economic problems, with players being due several months in wages. After confirmation by the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Royal Spanish Football Federation</a> on 1 August 2008, the club was relegated a further category.
Extremadura's sporting and financial troubles continued in the following years, with the club never ranking higher than 16th. In August 2010 it folded, being dissolved by its major shareholder, the Almendralejo City Hall; that fate had already befallen Mérida, with Badajoz being saved in the last minute, replaced by another team in the city and being dropped to level four.
Stadium.
CF Extremadura's first permanent ground was called "Campo de Santa Aurora", which was located on "Camino Alange". It was used from 1928 to 1935, when the club moved to nearby "Campo Santa Elvira".
In 1950, the idea of building a municipal stadium was formed, and the club moved to a plot of land adjacent to the proposed stadium. For just over one season, it played at the site, called "Los Cañizos". On 12 October 1951, Extremadura played <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla FC</a> in the inaugural match at the new grounds, "<a href="Estadio%20Francisco%20de%20la%20Hera">Estadio Francisco de la Hera</a>". The stadium remained relatively unchanged until 1996, when it was demolished to make way for a revamped one, with and a seated capacity of 11,580.

CD Alcoyano

Club Deportivo Alcoyano, <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">S.A.D.</a> is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Alcoy%20%28Spain%29">Alcoy</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencia</a>. Founded in 1928 it plays in <a href="Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">Primera División RFEF – Group 2</a>, holding home games in "<a href="Estadio%20El%20Collao">Estadio El Collao</a>", with a 4,850-seat capacity. The team is also known by its name in <a href="Valencian">Valencian</a>, "Alcoià".
A <a href="simile">simile</a> exists in Spanish which includes the name of this football club, "Tener más moral que el Alcoyano" ("To have more morale than Alcoyano"). The phrase possibly originated in the 1950s, when Alcoyano were losing a game by 0–13 at home but never gave up, still trying hard to score at the end of the match. However, this is disputed by some historians, with the origins being somewhat unclear. The official anthem of the club is "La moral del Alcoyano" (Alcoyano moral), music by Miguel Peidró and Jaime Lloret and lyrics by Armando Santacreu. It was composed in 1979 for the 50th anniversary of the club. In 2004, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of the club, the music was modernized and the anthem performed by the singer José Zamora.
History.
The city of Alcoy had a very important club, the Boxing Club Deportivo Alcoyano. In 1927 its football section won a large number of games against major clubs which led to the formation of the football club. "Club Deportivo Alcoyano" saw the light in 1928, after a merger between two clubs in the city, Levante and Racing. However, it only joined the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Royal Spanish Football Federation</a> four years later.
In 1942, the club first reached the "<a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>", going on to alternate between that level and the <a href="La%20Liga">top flight</a> in the subsequent years. Their debut in the latter took place with a 2–3 home loss against <a href="Real%20Murcia">Real Murcia</a>, in an eventual <a href="1945%E2%80%9346%20La%20Liga">relegation</a>, as second from bottom. In that season the club got only 8 points and conceded 28 goals in 14 games played, the worst result among 8 teams. For the first time in history Alcoyano reached <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, first Spanish division, in 1945 by winning Segunda División.
In <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20La%20Liga">1947–48</a>, Alcoyano maintained its first division status for the only time in its history, even finishing higher than <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. That season was the best in Alcoyano's history – the club finished in 10th position in La Liga. The following forty years, however, were spent mainly in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">third</a> and <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">fourth divisions</a>, with very brief spells in level two. In the 1953–54 season Alcoyano was relegated to the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> for the first time in its history. In the 1954–55 season the club reached first place in the Group 10 of Tercera División, but failed to promote back to Segunda División B.
Alcoyano returned to the third category for <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2004–05</a>, consistently reached the promotion play-offs, and consistently failed to be promoted. In the 2005–06 season, the team also had <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Copa%20del%20Rey">a good run</a> in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Spanish Cup</a>, beating <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">RCD Mallorca</a> 4–1 and losing by just one goal (0–1) in the fourth round against <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>.
In June 2011, 42 years after, Alcoyano finally returned to the second division, after <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">finishing in third position</a> in the <a href="Season%20%28sports%29%23Regular%20season">regular season</a>, and disposing of <a href="Real%20Madrid%20Castilla">Real Madrid Castilla</a>, <a href="SD%20Eibar">SD Eibar</a> and <a href="CD%20Lugo">CD Lugo</a> in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20Play-Off">promotion playoffs</a>. However, the club spent only one season in the second division and relegated back to Segunda División B. On 1 August 2014, the club completed the transformation process into "Public Limited Sports Company" (Sociedad Anónima Deportiva).
In the 2018–19 season, Alcoyano club finished 16th in the Segunda División B, Group 3, close to the relegation place.
On 20 January 2021, Alcoyano made history by eliminating Spanish giants and reigning La Liga champions <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> from the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2020–21 Copa del Rey</a>, beating them 2–1 at home.

Córdoba CF

Córdoba Club de Fútbol (), competing as Unión Futbolística Cordobesa S.A.D., is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football club</a> based in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Andalusia">Córdoba</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. Founded in 1954 as Club Deportivo San Álvaro, it was refounded as Cordoba CF in 1954 after the dissolution of <a href="RCD%20C%C3%B3rdoba">RCD Córdoba</a>. Currently it plays in the <a href="Primera%20Federaci%C3%B3n">Primera Federación</a> - Group 2, with its home matches at the <a href="Estadio%20Nuevo%20Arc%C3%A1ngel">Estadio Nuevo Arcángel</a>, which has a capacity of 25,800 seats.
History.
Forerunners of "Córdoba Club de Fútbol" included names such as "Sporting Fútbol Club de Córdoba", "Sociedad Deportiva Electromecánicas" and "Racing Fútbol Club de Córdoba". The latter changed its name after the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> (as foreign names were banned under the new regime) to "Club Deportivo Córdoba".
From 1940, its predecessor <a href="RCD%20C%C3%B3rdoba">RCD Córdoba</a> met varying success, spending most of its time in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second</a> and <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">third divisions</a> of <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football</a>. In 1944 it changed its home kit to green and white stripes, from the previous one of all white, and, the following year, Córdoba moved from "Estadio America" to "Estadio del Arcángel". In 1954, RCD Córdoba was dissolved due to its many debts and Córdoba CF was refounded by acquiring the place of "CD San Álvaro de Córdoba" in the third category.
In the early 1960s and also in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20La%20Liga">1971–72</a>, Córdoba amassed eight <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> seasons. In <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20La%20Liga">its third presence</a> it only conceded two goals at home as it went undefeated, the first being courtesy of <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">Espanyol</a>'s <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a>. The club finished 5th, its best finish to date, but was not allowed to enter the following season's <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> due to city infrastructure issues.
In the following four decades Córdoba again fluctuated between divisions two and three, also spending 1984–85 in the fourth. After a successful 1999–2000 season in Segunda División B Córdoba was finally promoted to Segunda División.
On 17 February 2014, former Spanish international <a href="Albert%20Ferrer">Albert Ferrer</a> was hired as Córdoba manager. He led the team to a 7th-place finish, and then Córdoba defeated <a href="UD%20Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a> in the Segunda División play-off final to return to the top flight for the first time in 42 years. <a href="Ulises%20D%C3%A1vila">Ulises Dávila</a> scored the decisive goal, a late equaliser in the away second leg, after Las Palmas fans had caused ten minutes to be added onto the game by invading the pitch.
Córdoba experienced a difficult return to La Liga however. In their opening match of the 2014–15 season, Córdoba lost 2–0 away at <a href="Real%20Madrid">Real Madrid</a>, putting them in 19th place on the table, after round 1. Following that, the team did not achieve a single win, up until the 14th round, when they managed to win 0–1 away at <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>. This boosted their hopes for survival in the elite. Additional wins against <a href="CF%20Granada">CF Granada</a> at home and <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a> away in rounds 17 and 18 put the team in 14th place. However, ten straight defeats from rounds 20-29 again put the Andalusians in last place. The team did not improve, remaining in last place until the end of the season. They only collected two points from their last 18 games, thus losing all hopes for survival. At the end of the season, Córdoba only collected 20 points, 15 points behind Granada CF, which avoided relegation. Their relegation was confirmed with three games remaining after a 0–8 home defeat against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>.
On 15 June 2018, the club announced that it had purchased local women's club <a href="AD%20El%20Naranjo">AD El Naranjo</a> and their respective youth teams with the intention of turning them into the club's official women's team. The newly created <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%20CF%20%28women%29">Córdoba Club de Fútbol Femenino</a> will play in the Spanish <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20%28women%29">Segunda División (women)</a> starting in the 2018–19 season. After ranking second-to-last in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2018–19 Segunda División</a> (after disqualified Reus), the club was demoted to <a href="Segunda%20B">Segunda B</a>.

History.
Football became of a particular interest in Girona at the beginning of the 20th century. The first major club in the city was Strong Esport (founded in 1902 under original name of FC Gerundense). In the 1920s in Girona there were two new clubs, CE Gironí and UD Girona. After the disappearance of the UD Girona it was decided to create a new football team in the city.
On 23 July 1930, in the café Norat in La Rambla of <a href="Girona">Girona</a>, Girona Futbol Club was founded upon the dissolution of Unió Esportiva Girona for economic reasons. On 1 August 1930, the city council authorized the club so that it could use the city's emblem on its badges. It was achieved thanks to the efforts of enthusiasts led by the club's first president Albert de Quintana de León. The team subsequently entered in the second division of the Catalan Championships. Its first official match was against Colònia Artigas with the lineup: Florenza, Teixidor, Farró, Flavià, Comas, Corradi, Ferrer, Escuder, Clara, Torrellas and Taradellas.
<a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1935–36</a> was the first season Girona played in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, and the club finished in top position in its group, subsequently appearing in the playoff stage against <a href="Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a>, <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a>, <a href="Arenas%20Club%20de%20Getxo">Arenas Club</a>, <a href="Real%20Murcia">Real Murcia</a> and <a href="Xerez%20CD">Xerez</a>, but finishing second from bottom, thus out of the <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> promotion zone.
After the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, the club fluctuated between the second level and <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>, falling into the latter category in 1959 and being further demoted in 1980 – <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> was created as the new division three in 1977, and the club lasted three years in the competition. In 1968, construction of the <a href="Estadi%20Montilivi">Estadi Montilivi</a> began, with home matches being held there on a permanent basis from 1970 onwards after nearly five decades at the Vista Alegre stadium.
In the following decades, Girona alternated between the third and the fourth divisions, even spending three seasons in the regional championships, in 1982–83 and 1997–99. On 16 June 2008, after defeating <a href="AD%20Ceuta">Ceuta</a> 1–0 in <a href="2008%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">the play-offs</a>, the <a href="Ra%C3%BCl%20Agn%C3%A9">Raül Agné</a>-led side achieved a second consecutive promotion, returning to the second tier after a 49-year absence.
On 22 July 2010, a group of local businessmen led by Ramon Vilaró, Joaquim Boadas and Josep Slim purchased 72% of the club's shares, previously held by former club president Josep Gusó and Josep Rofes, thus becoming the new owners of Girona. Vilaró was elected the new president while Agné, after a spell with <a href="Recreativo%20de%20Huelva">Recreativo</a>, returned as manager for <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the upcoming second division campaign</a>, lasting in the position until 14 January 2012 when he was sacked following a 0–3 loss at Recreativo.
In 2011, Girona created a <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a>, having previously grown a natural grass pitch in Palau. On 9 May 2013, the club's <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of directors</a>, under the slogan "El Girona FC també és meu" ("Girona FC is mine too"), approved an increase of the club's capital in <a href="Euro">€</a>300,000 to be distributed in €10 shares, aiming to balance its estate.
On the last matchday of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2014–15 season</a>, Girona needed to beat <a href="CD%20Lugo">Lugo</a> at home to earn promotion to La Liga, but were denied by a last-minute goal by the visitors. Girona had to settle for a play-off place, but were eliminated in the semi-finals by <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a>, despite winning the first leg 3–0. <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">The next season</a>, they reached the play-off final but were defeated by <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a>. Girona finally earned promotion to La Liga after the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2016–17</a> season as they finished runners-up to <a href="Levante%20UD">Levante</a>. This was the first time that Girona had ever been promoted to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in their 87-year history.

Girona faced the Indian team <a href="Kerala%20Blasters">Kerala Blasters</a> and the Australian Team <a href="Melbourne%20City%20FC">Melbourne City</a>.
On the last match day of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20La%20Liga">2018–19 La Liga</a> season, Girona were relegated to <a href="Segunda%20Division">Segunda Division</a>, after losing 2–1 against <a href="Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s">Deportivo Alavés</a>, ending their two-year spell in the Spanish top tier.

History.
The city of <a href="Huesca">Huesca</a> is one of the pioneers in the introduction of football in <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a>. In the beginning of the 20th century (in 1903), the city already had a society named "Foot-ball Oscense".
Huesca Fútbol Club was founded in 1910 with Jorge Cajal as the first president. On 10 April 1910 the first formal match was played in the city of <a href="Huesca">Huesca</a> between the teams of the Sertorius Club, formed by high school students, and El Ideal de Magisterio Oscense. The match was organized by Huesca Sport Club.
In 1913, Huesca Sport Club became Huesca Fútbol Club. At this time other teams also emerged, among them Atlético Osca and the Stadium, which later merged with Huesca FC. The Stadium wore blue and red colors of <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and the team acquired those colors for their T-shirts.
16 years later it folded – after it had joined the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Royal Spanish Football Federation</a> in 1922 (its department in the Aragon autonomous community in Spain - the Aragonese Football Federation, founded in 1922). But in 1929 reappeared as "CD Huesca", being renamed "<a href="UD%20Huesca">Unión Deportiva</a>" in 1943, but the club again disappeared in 1956 due to financial problems. The first president after official registration of the Huesca Fútbol Club was Santos Solana. Lorenzo Lera was the first associate of the club, which was enrolled in the Federation with the <a href="blaugrana">blaugrana</a> colours as its founding members were FC Barcelona supporters.
One of the first games of written reference was a <a href="local%20derby">local derby</a> against "Bosco FC", a 3–5 loss. In the mid-1920s the club turned professional and, in 1926, a match against FC Barcelona was played at the "Villa Isabel", in a 2–2 draw. Following the serious incidents that occurred on 23 October 1927 in the match against <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a> in the Regional Championship, with a field invasion by fans due to lousy arbitration and consequent sanctions of the Regional Federation for three months, the club was withdrawn from the championship and passed its players to other teams. In early 1930s emerged the Huesca Sports Club (Club Deportivo Huesca) which won the Regional Fans Championship (Campeonato Regional de Aficionados) in the 1930–31 season, reaching the final of the National Championship, where lost to Ciosvín in the <a href="Estadio%20Chamart%C3%ADn">Estadio Chamartín</a> in Madrid. During the Civil War, football was still played in Huesca and in 1939 the Huesca Fútbol Club instantly reappeared. From the 1943–44 season and after being renamed to Unión Deportiva Huesca the club played for seven consecutive seasons in Tercera División. In 1950, Huesca first reached <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>.
On 29 March 1960 Sociedad Deportiva Huesca evolved, first playing in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> in 1977. The 1960–61 season Huesca played in Regional category and achieved promotion to <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>, where remained for 12 consecutive seasons. Huesca were champions of their Tercera División group for two years running for the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1966-67</a> and <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1967-68</a> seasons but were defeated in the playoff promotions each time.
In the 1972–73 season the club was relegated to Primera Regional, which is a regional level competition. But the next year it returned to Tercera División. The club headed Tercera División in the 1989–90 season and as a result was promoted to Segunda División B.
In the 2005–06 season, SD Huesca was relegated to Tercera División. In 2006 the club finished second in the <a href="Copa%20Federaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Copa Federación de España</a>, losing to <a href="CD%20Puertollano">Puertollano</a>; in that same season it narrowly avoided relegation to Tercera División, after a play-off against <a href="Castillo%20CF">Castillo</a>.
In the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2006–07 campaign</a> the club reached the play-offs for promotion to the second level, having lost a two-legged final against <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%20CF">Córdoba CF</a>. In <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">the following season</a>, it returned to the "silver category". It happened on 15 September 2008 after the win over Écjija in the promotion play-off.
<a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2008–09's second division</a> was a regular one for Huesca led by coach <a href="Antonio%20Calder%C3%B3n">Antonio Calderón</a>, with the new league status being maintained with many rounds left. Huesca finished that season in the 11th position. <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Castro">Rubén Castro</a>, loaned by <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo La Coruña</a>, was one of the most important players during the campaign, scoring 14 times, ninth-best in the league. In its second season in the Segunda División, the team struggled to remain there. Huesca finished in 13th position, just 2 points away from being relegated. The best scorer in the team that season was <a href="Juanjo%20Camacho">Juanjo Camacho</a>, who scored 8 goals in the competition.
In the 2010–11 season Huesca retained its place in the Segunda División finishing in the 14th position. The result was achieved by the good defensive performance. The goalkeeper <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20December%201986%29">Andrés Fernández</a> was awarded with the <a href="Zamora%20Trophy">Zamora Trophy</a> for having the lowest "goals-to-games" ratio in the division.
Relegation followed at the end of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2012–13</a> season, but the club returned to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> in 2015 after a first-place finish and eventually a two-leg play-off victory over <a href="Hurac%C3%A1n%20Valencia%20CF">Huracán Valencia</a>.
After the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2016–17 season</a>, Huesca qualified for the <a href="2017%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20play-offs">promotion play-offs</a> to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> for the first time ever, but was eliminated in the semifinals by <a href="Getafe%20CF">Getafe</a>. The azulgranas managed to play 2:2 at home, but then lost 0:3 in the away game. In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2017–18 season</a>, Huesca was promoted to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> for the first time in their history after winning 2–0 against <a href="CD%20Lugo">Lugo</a> on 21 May 2018 at the <a href="Estadio%20Anxo%20Carro">Anxo Carro stadium</a>.
On 4 May 2019, Huesca was relegated back to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> after only one season in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>.
Huesca won promotion back to La Liga on 17 July 2020, after a 3–0 win over <a href="CD%20Numancia">Numancia</a> and secured the league title on the last matchday. On 22 May 2021, despite winning two of their last five fixtures of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20La%20Liga">2020–21 season</a>, the club was relegated back to the second tier once more after drawing 0–0 on the last matchday against <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>, the same team who had beaten them 6–2 to cause their relegation two years earlier. A month later, the club had its first <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spanish international</a>, goalkeeper <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201998%29">Álvaro Fernández</a>, who stepped in along with his under-21 teammates after the senior squad became unavailable due to a <a href="COVID-19">COVID-19</a> case.
Stadium.
During the 1971–72 season Huesca decided to build a new football stadium, "<a href="Estadio%20El%20Alcoraz">Estadio El Alcoraz</a>", the team's third in its history, located in the hills of San Jorge with a capacity of 9,100 seats. The 1974 Amateur Cup of Spain final took place there.

Its main shareholder is the <a href="China">Chinese</a> company Desport, and its president <a href="Jiang%20Lizhang">Jiang Lizhang</a>. The club was founded in 1931 with the name of "Club Recreativo Granada", and plays its home matches at the <a href="Nuevo%20Estadio%20de%20Los%20C%C3%A1rmenes">Nuevo Estadio de Los Cármenes</a>.
Since 17 July 2020, the club is located at position 22 of the historical points classification of the First Division, and 20 of the historical First Division number of seasons classification, where it has participated in 25 seasons and finished in sixth place twice. Granada was the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> runner-up in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo">1959</a> (the competition was then known as the "Copa del Generalísimo"). The club finished the 2019–20 season in 7th, qualifiying for their first-ever European appearance, in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>, where they were quarter-finalists.
History.
Foundation.
"Granada Club de Fútbol" was founded on 6 April 1931, originally as "Recreativo de Granada"; the first president was Julio López Fernández. It was him who registered the club in the Registry of Associations in the Civil Government and presented the first Board of Directors.
The first football match was played against the Deportivo Jaén on 6 December 1931, which resulted in a 2–1 victory. The first goal in the match, and in the club's history, was scored by Antonio Bombillar. The first home match was played against U.D. Andújar two weeks later. Granada won it 1–0. It took place at Campo de Las Tablas stadium. In the 1931–32 season, the club finished 2nd in the "Tercera Regional – Región Sur" championship. 4 wins in 6 matches helped Granada achieve promotion to the Segunda Regional. The club started the season in a new division with a new president, Gabriel Morcillo Raya. During the 1932–33 season the club had the biggest win in its history, 11–0 against <a href="Xerez%20FC">Xerez</a> on 23 April 1933.
La Liga entry and peak.
After several promotions, in 1941–42 the club made its <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> debut. It was the match against the Celta on 28 September 1941. The game ended up in 1–1 draw. The first Granada goal in the highest Spanish division was scored by <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20%C3%81lvarez">César Rodríguez Álvarez</a>. During that season the Granada had some historical home wins, among them 8–0 against <a href="Real%20Oviedo">Real Oviedo</a> and 6–0 against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. Granada finished the season in the 10th position among 14 teams.
From 1942 until the 1980s, it alternated between the top flight and the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, with its golden age coming during the late 1960s and mid 70s, as the Andalusian club had eight consecutive top flight seasons between 1968–69 and 1975–76 and made the Copa del Rey semi and quarter-finals on 4 occasions. These seasons also included a best-ever sixth league places in the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20La%20Liga">1971–72</a> and <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20La%20Liga">1973–74</a> seasons. Granada finished the 1971–72 season with 9 wins in the last 10 home games, with powerhouses Barcelona and Real Madrid being among those wins.
In 1959 Granada achieved its greatest landmark, being the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Copa%20del%20Rey">runner-up</a> of the "<a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Generalísimo</a>" (later "Copa del Rey"). In <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Copa%20del%20Rey%23Final">the final</a>, played at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a>, the team lost to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> 4–1. The only goal for Granada was scored by the Argentinian forward Ramón Carranza.
In the 1980s, Granada had some brief appearances in the second division. In 1983–84, they finished 8th among 20 teams in the Segunda División, just 10 points away from the champion the <a href="Real%20Madrid%20Castilla">Real Madrid Castilla</a> and the runner-up the <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao%20B">Bilbao Athletic</a>. In 1984–85, Granada finished 18th and were relegated to the Segunda División B; in the same season, the club was eliminated by fourth-tier club <a href="CD%20Estepona">Estepona</a> in the second round of the Copa del Rey. Although the club returned to the Segunda División after two years for the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1987–88 season</a>, it was relegated again that same season after finishing 19th.
Decline and revival.
Granada spent most of the following seasons in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>, and were relegated to the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">fourth tier</a> in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2002–03</a>, due to failing to pay its players under the presidency of Francisco Jimena. After four seasons in the fourth division, former <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> president <a href="Lorenzo%20Sanz">Lorenzo Sanz</a>, along with his son <a href="Paco%20Sanz%20%28footballer%29">Paco</a>, arrived at the club. With their help, the <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>n side was again promoted to the third category but got itself into serious financial trouble. In the 2005–06 season Granada won Group 9 of the Tercera División and qualified for the promotional play-offs, where the first rival was <a href="Real%20Balomp%C3%A9dica%20Linense">Linense</a>. After the two games ended up in 1–1 draws, Granada won in the penalty shootout. After that they had to face <a href="CD%20Guadalajara%20%28Spain%29">Guadalajara</a>, winning 3–1 on aggregate, which gave them promotion to the third tier.
In <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2006–07</a>, Granada played in Group IV of the third level after four seasons in the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera</a>. The president Paco Sanz, with the massive support of the fans, continued to lead the project with the intention of bringing the team to the top division, but the lack of time after the promotion led to hasty actions. In July 2009, the club was in such financial difficulty that it was on the brink of dissolving. The solution to the crisis came with the signing of a partnership agreement between Granada and <a href="Udinese%20Calcio">Udinese Calcio</a>, with the Spaniards incorporating large numbers of players contracted to the Italian club as well as receiving its youth players and reserves as part of the agreement. At the end of <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">the season</a>, Granada won its group and then got promoted by beating <a href="AD%20Alcorc%C3%B3n">Alcorcón</a> in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20Play-Off">play-offs</a>, returning to the second division after 22 years.
In <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2010–11</a>, Granada finished in fifth position, with most of the players loaned by Udinese still on board. On 18 June 2011, the club became the first winner of the <a href="2011%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20play-offs">promotion play-offs</a> – a different system was used from 1985 to 1999 – after successively defeating <a href="RC%20Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a> (1–1, <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootout</a>) and <a href="Elche%20CF">Elche</a> (1–1 on aggregate, <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>), thus returning to the top division after a 35-year absence.
In June 2016, Chinese businessman <a href="Jiang%20Lizhang">Jiang Lizhang</a> became the new owner of the club, buying the Pozzo family's controlling stake. After surviving in the top flight for six seasons, the team was relegated in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20La%20Liga">2016–17</a> after being defeated by <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>.
Under new manager <a href="Diego%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Penas">Diego Martínez</a>, Granada returned to the top flight as runners-up to <a href="CA%20Osasuna">CA Osasuna</a> in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2018–19 Segunda División</a>. The following season, the team finished 7th in the top flight, earning qualification for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>, the first time the club qualified for any European competition. It also reached the Copa del Rey semi-finals for the first time in 50 years, narrowly losing to Athletic Bilbao on away goals after a 2–2 aggregate draw. They reached the quarter-finals in Europe, being eliminated by <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. On 22 May 2022, the team was relegated after a draw against <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">Espanyol</a>. In the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2022–23 season</a>, Granada returned to La Liga, by sealing a 1st position in the table on the very last match day of the season.

Stadium.
After its foundation, the team played its home matches at the "Campo de Las Tablas", inaugurated on 20 December 1931. On that day Granada CF won the match against the U.D. Andújar 1–0 in the Tercera Regional. Granada's stay at this ground was a short one; on 23 December 1934, a new municipal stadium, "<a href="Estadio%20Los%20C%C3%A1rmenes">Estadio Los Cármenes</a>", was opened. The club played in this stadium until 1995 when they moved to the <a href="Nuevo%20Estadio%20de%20Los%20C%C3%A1rmenes">Nuevo Los Cármenes Stadium</a> (also owned by the <a href="Ayuntamiento%20de%20Granada">Ayuntamiento de Granada</a>). It was inaugurated on 16 May 1995, with a friendly fixture between Real Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen, whereas Granada CF played for the first time in the Summer of 1995, playing a friendly fixture against <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a>. The stadium featured an original capacity of 16,212 seats. This was expanded to 22,524 after Granada CF's promotion to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in the summer of 2011.
After achieving promotion to the First Division in 2019, the stadium has been renovated, such as the replacement of the playing surface, the repairing and painting of seats plus the addition of white seats to form the words "Granada CF" across from the main stand and "1931" on the South Stand, the expansion of the official club store (now located on the corner where the old tickets office was located), and finally, the replacement of the illumination system in line with the lighting requirements of <a href="LaLiga">LaLiga</a>. In addition, the club is working with Granada's council to get a deal for a long-lasting tenancy with the aim of performing a series of investments like a re-build of the stadium corners (which had been previously dismantled), establish shopping and entertainment zones or the expansion and refurbishment of sponsor and advertising areas.
Kit and colours.
Upon its foundation, the club's kits were a shirt with blue and white vertical stripes and white shorts. After the Spanish Civil War the club owners went to Madrid to buy new ones, but they couldn't find other than red and white striped shirts. That became the official colour scheme from then on.
In the 1970s, the club changed the vertical stripes to horizontal. The kit alternated horizontal and vertical strip patterns until 2004–05, when a member assembly decided to settle for the horizontal pattern.

In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the <a href="Continental%20Treble">continental treble</a> consisting of <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> and the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, and also became the first European football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the <a href="2009%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Spanish Super Cup</a>, <a href="2009%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> and <a href="2009%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>. In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen trophies in just four years under <a href="Pep%20Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a>, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in <a href="2015%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2015</a> under <a href="Luis%20Enrique">Luis Enrique</a>, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.
History.
1899–1922: Beginnings.
On 22 October 1899, Swiss <a href="Joan%20Gamper">Hans Gamper</a> placed an advertisement in "<a href="Los%20Deportes">Los Deportes</a>" declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – <a href="Walter%20Wild">Walter Wild</a> (the first president of the club), <a href="Luis%20de%20Oss%C3%B3">Luis de Ossó</a>, <a href="Bartomeu%20Terradas">Bartomeu Terradas</a>, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, <a href="John%20Parsons%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201875%29">John Parsons</a>, and <a href="William%20Parsons%20%28footballer%29">William Parsons</a> – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.
FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the <a href="Catalan%20football%20championship">Campionat de Catalunya</a> and the . In 1901, the club participated in the very first football competition played on the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, the <a href="Copa%20Macaya">Copa Macaya</a>, narrowly losing to <a href="Hispania%20Athletic%20Club">Hispania AC</a>, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of silverware, and then participated in the <a href="1902%20Copa%20de%20la%20Coronaci%C3%B3n">first Copa del Rey</a>, losing 1–2 to <a href="Bizcaya%20%28football%20team%29">Bizcaya</a> (a combination of players from <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Club</a> and <a href="Bilbao%20Football%20Club">Bilbao FC</a>) in the <a href="1902%20Copa%20de%20la%20Coronaci%C3%B3n%20Final">final</a>. In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, "Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on." Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.
On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the <a href="Camp%20de%20la%20Ind%C3%BAstria">Camp de la Indústria</a>, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. <a href="Carles%20Comamala">Carles Comamala</a> won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.
The stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team, winning three successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between <a href="1910%20Copa%20del%20Rey%23Copa%20FEF%20%28Federaci%C3%B3n%20Espa%C3%B1ola%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%29">1910</a> and <a href="1913%20Copa%20del%20Rey%23Copa%20UECF%20%28Uni%C3%B3n%20Espa%C3%B1ola%20de%20Clubes%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%29">1913</a>, and four successive <a href="Pyrenees%20Cup">Pyrenees Cup</a> between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913, which was one of the earliest international club cups in Europe since it consisted of the best teams of <a href="Languedoc">Languedoc</a>, <a href="Le%20midi">Midi</a> and <a href="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a> (Southern France), the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a> and Catalonia; all were former members of the <a href="Marca%20Hispanica">Marca Hispanica</a> region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era. Notable figures of Barça's first great team include Carles Comamala, <a href="Alfredo%20Massana">Alfredo Massana</a>, <a href="Manuel%20Amechazurra">Amechazurra</a>, <a href="Francisco%20Bru">Paco Bru</a> and <a href="Jack%20Greenwell">Jack Greenwell</a>. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.
During the same period, the club changed its official language from <a href="Spanish%20language">Castilian</a> to <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a> and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first <a href="testimonial%20match">tribute match</a> to honour <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Torralba">Ramón Torralba</a>, who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.
Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new <a href="Camp%20de%20Les%20Corts">Les Cortes</a>, which they inaugurated the same year. Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.
In 1912, Gamper recruited <a href="Paulino%20Alc%C3%A1ntara">Paulino Alcántara</a>, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a> in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field and soon enjoyed its first "golden age". Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included <a href="Emilio%20Sagi%20Li%C3%B1%C3%A1n">Sagibarba</a>, <a href="Ricardo%20Zamora">Ricardo Zamora</a>, <a href="Josep%20Samitier">Josep Samitier</a>, <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Ses%C3%BAmaga">Félix Sesúmaga</a> and <a href="Franz%20Platko">Franz Platko</a>. This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between 1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in <a href="1920%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1920</a> and <a href="1922%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1922</a>. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups.
1923–1957: Rivera, Republic and Civil War.
On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against <a href="Miguel%20Primo%20de%20Rivera">Primo de Rivera</a>'s dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the <a href="Royal%20March">Royal March</a>. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club. This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.
On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for <a href="Paulino%20Alc%C3%A1ntara">Paulino Alcántara</a>, against the <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spanish national team</a>. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane. In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled "Oda a <a href="Franz%20Platko">Platko</a>", which was written by a member of the <a href="Generation%20of%20%2727">Generation of '27</a>, <a href="Rafael%20Alberti">Rafael Alberti</a>, inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a>, Franz Platko. On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the <a href="1929%20La%20Liga">inaugural Spanish League</a>. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.
Although they continued to have players of the standing of <a href="Josep%20Escol%C3%A0">Josep Escolà</a>, the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters. Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938, success at a national level (with the exception of the <a href="Mediterranean%20League">1937 disputed title</a>) evaded them.
A month after the entire <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, <a href="Falangist">Falangist</a> soldiers near <a href="Guadarrama">Guadarrama</a> murdered club president <a href="Josep%20Sunyol">Josep Sunyol</a>, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of "barcelonisme", and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>. The tour led to the financial security of the club but also resulted in half of the team seeking <a href="right%20of%20asylum">asylum</a> in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.
On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the <a href="Italian%20Air%20Force">Italian Air Force</a>, causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices. A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the "undisciplined" <a href="Catalanism">Catalanism</a>, the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The <a href="Senyera">Catalan flag</a> was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to "Club de Fútbol Barcelona" and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.
In <a href="El%20Cl%C3%A1sico%231943%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20semi-finals">1943</a>, Barcelona faced rivals <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> in the semi-finals of <a href="Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo">Copa del Generalísimo</a> (now the Copa del Rey). The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0. Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg, beating Barcelona 11–1. According to football writer <a href="Sid%20Lowe">Sid Lowe</a>, "There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims." It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona's players were threatened by police in the changing room, though nothing was ever proven.
Despite the difficult political situation, "CF Barcelona" enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with <a href="Josep%20Samitier">Josep Samitier</a> as coach and players like <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Alvarez">César</a>, <a href="Antoni%20Ramallets">Ramallets</a> and <a href="Juan%20Zambudio%20Velasco">Velasco</a>, they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949. In <a href="1949%20Latin%20Cup">1949</a>, they also won the first <a href="Latin%20Cup">Copa Latina</a>. In June 1950, Barcelona signed <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Kubala">László Kubala</a>, who was to be an important figure at the club.
On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Santander</a> by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the <a href="Francoist">Francoist</a> authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of <a href="Supporters%20of%20FC%20Barcelona">blaugrana fans</a>. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive <a href="Spaniards">Spaniards</a> saw the club as a staunch defender of <a href="rights">rights</a> and <a href="freedoms">freedoms</a>.
Coach <a href="Ferdinand%20Dau%C4%8D%C3%ADk">Ferdinand Daučík</a> and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the <a href="Copa%20Latina">Copa Latina</a>, the <a href="Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Copa Eva Duarte</a>, and the <a href="Copa%20Martini%20%26amp%3B%20Rossi">Copa Martini & Rossi</a> in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.
1957–1978: Club de Fútbol Barcelona.
With <a href="Helenio%20Herrera">Helenio Herrera</a> as coach, a young <a href="Luis%20Su%C3%A1rez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201935%29">Luis Suárez</a>, the <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or%20%281956%E2%80%932009%29">European Footballer of the Year</a> in 1960, and two influential <a href="Hungary">Hungarians</a> recommended by Kubala, <a href="S%C3%A1ndor%20Kocsis">Sándor Kocsis</a> and <a href="Zolt%C3%A1n%20Czibor">Zoltán Czibor</a>, the team won another national double in 1959 and a <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> and Fairs Cup double in 1960. In 1961, they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a> play-off. However, they lost 2–3 to <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> in the final.
The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a>, finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players. The 1960s saw the emergence of <a href="Josep%20Maria%20Fust%C3%A9">Josep Maria Fusté</a> and <a href="Carles%20Rexach">Carles Rexach</a>, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu</a> in front of dictator <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>, with coach <a href="Salvador%20Artigas">Salvador Artigas</a>, a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to "Futbol Club Barcelona" and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.
The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a>, who was bought for a world record £920,000 from <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>. Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son <a href="Jordi%20Cruyff">"Jordi"</a>, after the local Catalan <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a>. Next to champions like <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20Asensi">Juan Manuel Asensi</a>, Carles Rexach and <a href="Hugo%20Sotil">Hugo Sotil</a>, he helped the club win the <a href="La%20Liga%201973%E2%80%9374">1973–74 season</a> for the first time since 1960, defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route. He was crowned <a href="European%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">European Footballer of the Year</a> in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player to do so) in 1974, while he was still with Barcelona.
1978–2000: Núñez and stabilization.
In 1978, <a href="Josep%20Llu%C3%ADs%20N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez">Josep Lluís Núñez</a> became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as <a href="Diego%20Maradona">Diego Maradona</a>, <a href="Rom%C3%A1rio">Romário</a> and <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a> rather than meeting their demands.
On 16 May 1979, the club won its first <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> by beating <a href="Fortuna%20D%C3%BCsseldorf">Fortuna Düsseldorf</a> 4–3 in <a href="Basel">Basel</a> in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling "blaugrana" fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.
In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from <a href="Boca%20Juniors">Boca Juniors</a>. In the following season, under coach <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Luis%20Menotti">César Luis Menotti</a>, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a>. At the start of the <a href="La%20Liga%201984-85">1984–85</a> season, <a href="Terry%20Venables">Terry Venables</a> was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder <a href="Bernd%20Schuster">Bernd Schuster</a>. The next season, he took the team to their second <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a> <a href="1986%20European%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, only to lose on penalties to <a href="CSA%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti%20%28football%29">Steaua București</a> during a dramatic evening in <a href="Seville">Seville</a>.
Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, <a href="Boixos%20Nois">Boixos Nois</a>. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in <a href="skinheads">skinheads</a>, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a> to <a href="fascism">fascism</a>, which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.
After the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 FIFA World Cup</a>, Barcelona signed the English top scorer <a href="Gary%20Lineker">Gary Lineker</a>, along with goalkeeper <a href="Andoni%20Zubizarreta">Andoni Zubizarreta</a>, but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with <a href="Luis%20Aragon%C3%A9s">Luis Aragonés</a>. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>.
The "Dream Team" era.
In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club, this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the "Dream Team". He used a mix of Spanish players like <a href="Pep%20Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mari%20Bakero">José Mari Bakero</a>, <a href="Jon%20Andoni%20Goikoetxea">Jon Andoni Goikoetxea</a>, <a href="Miguel%20Angel%20Nadal">Miguel Angel Nadal</a>, and <a href="Txiki%20Begiristain">Txiki Begiristain</a> while signing international players such as <a href="Ronald%20Koeman">Ronald Koeman</a>, <a href="Michael%20Laudrup">Michael Laudrup</a>, <a href="Rom%C3%A1rio">Romário</a>, and <a href="Hristo%20Stoichkov">Hristo Stoichkov</a>.
It was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. Pep Guardiola, the future coach of Barcelona, was one of the first graduates and would go on to receive international recognition.
Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat <a href="U.C.%20Sampdoria">Sampdoria</a> in both the 1989 <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> final and the 1992 <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a> final at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>, with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">European Super Cup</a> in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point. He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving eight years. Cruyff's fortune was to change, and, in his final two seasons, he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez, resulting in his departure. On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state, "Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it."
Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, <a href="Joan%20Laporta">Joan Laporta</a> and Alfons Godall. The objective of the group, called "L'Elefant Blau", was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values. Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.
Cruyff was briefly replaced by <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a>, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a> for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a> and delivered a <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">cup treble</a>, winning the Copa del Rey, <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games. Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for <a href="Louis%20van%20Gaal">Louis van Gaal</a> to become available.
Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> in another world record transfer. However, new heroes emerged, such as <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Figo">Luís Figo</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Kluivert">Patrick Kluivert</a>, <a href="Luis%20Enrique%20%28footballer%29">Luis Enrique</a> and <a href="Rivaldo">Rivaldo</a>, and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999, the club celebrated its "centenari", winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.
2000–2008: Exit Núñez, enter Laporta.
The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd. The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by <a href="Lorenzo%20Serra%20Ferrer">Lorenzo Serra Ferrer</a> who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from <a href="Rivaldo">Rivaldo</a>, who completed arguably the <a href="Hat-trick%23Association%20football">greatest hat-trick</a> in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.
Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by <a href="Radomir%20Anti%C4%87">Radomir Antić</a>, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president <a href="Joan%20Gaspart">Joan Gaspart</a> resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.
After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Dutch</a> and <a href="A.C.%20Milan">AC Milan</a> star <a href="Frank%20Rijkaard">Frank Rijkaard</a>, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including <a href="Ronaldinho">Ronaldinho</a>, <a href="Deco">Deco</a>, <a href="Henrik%20Larsson">Henrik Larsson</a>, <a href="Ludovic%20Giuly">Ludovic Giuly</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Eto%27o">Samuel Eto'o</a>, <a href="Rafael%20M%C3%A1rquez">Rafael Márquez</a> and <a href="Edgar%20Davids">Edgar Davids</a>, combined with home grown Spanish players, such as <a href="Carles%20Puyol">Carles Puyol</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Iniesta">Andrés Iniesta</a>, <a href="Xavi">Xavi</a> and <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Vald%C3%A9s">Víctor Valdés</a>, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2004–05</a>, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">FIFA World Player of the Year</a> awards.
In the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2005–06 season</a>, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation. In the Champions League, Barcelona beat English club <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">final</a>. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute <a href="Juliano%20Belletti">Juliano Belletti</a>, for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.
Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2006–07 season</a> without trophies. A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players, including leading scorer Eto'o and rising star <a href="Lionel%20Messi">Lionel Messi</a>. There was open feuding as Eto'o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form. In La Liga, Barcelona were in first place for much of the season, but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions. Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, winning the first leg against <a href="Getafe%20CF">Getafe</a> 5–2, with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona's <a href="Argentina%20v%20England%20%281986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%29%23The%20Goal%20of%20the%20Century">goal of the century</a>, but then lost the second leg 4–0. They took part in the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA Club World Cup</a>, but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side <a href="Sport%20Club%20Internacional">Internacional</a>. In the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> on <a href="away%20goals">away goals</a>.
Barcelona finished the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2007–08 season</a> third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> and <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey%202007%E2%80%9308">Copa del Rey</a>, both times losing to the eventual champions, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>, respectively. The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid, Joan Laporta announced that <a href="FC%20Barcelona%20Atl%C3%A8tic">Barcelona B</a> coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard's duties on 30 June 2008.
2008–2012: Guardiola era.
<a href="FC%20Barcelona%20B">Barcelona B</a> youth manager <a href="Pep%20Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season. Guardiola brought with him the now famous <a href="tiki-taka">tiki-taka</a> style of play he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.
Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the <a href="2009%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20final">2009 Copa del Rey final</a>, winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">2008–09 La Liga</a> champions. Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the <a href="Stadio%20Olimpico">Stadio Olimpico</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, with goals from Eto'o and Messi, to win their third Champions League title, and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team. The team went on to win the <a href="2009%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">2009 Supercopa de España</a> against Athletic Bilbao and the <a href="2009%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2009 UEFA Super Cup</a> against <a href="FC%20Shakhtar%20Donetsk">Shakhtar Donetsk</a>, becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble. In December 2009, Barcelona won the <a href="2009%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">2009 Club World Cup</a>. Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time.
After Laporta's departure from the club in June 2010, <a href="Sandro%20Rosell">Sandro Rosell</a> was soon elected as the new president. The elections were held on 13 June, where he got 61.35% (57,088 votes, a record) of total votes. Rosell signed <a href="David%20Villa">David Villa</a> from Valencia for €40 million and <a href="Javier%20Mascherano">Javier Mascherano</a> from Liverpool for €19 million. At the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 World Cup</a> in South Africa, Barcelona players that had graduated from the club's La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions. On 11 July, seven players who came through the academy participated in the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, six of whom were Barcelona players who started the match, with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands.
In November 2010, Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in "<a href="El%20Cl%C3%A1sico">El Clásico</a>". At the ceremony for the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20Ballon%20d%27Or">2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or</a> in December, Barcelona's La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or">Ballon d'Or</a>, with Messi, Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2010–11 season</a>, Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy, their third title in succession, finishing with 96 points. In April 2011, the club reached the <a href="2011%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey final</a>, losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the <a href="Mestalla%20Stadium">Mestalla Stadium</a> in <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>. In May, Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the <a href="2011%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2011 Champions League Final</a> 3–1 held at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, a repeat of the 2009 final, winning their fourth European Cup. In August 2011, La Masia graduate <a href="Cesc%20F%C3%A0bregas">Cesc Fàbregas</a> was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73, matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid.
Later the same month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a> 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's total amount of official trophies. The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.
In December, Barcelona won the <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">Club World Cup</a> for a record second time since its establishment, after defeating 2011 <a href="Copa%20Libertadores">Copa Libertadores</a> holders <a href="Santos%20FC">Santos</a> 4–0 in the <a href="2011%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a> thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas. As a result, the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16. Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time, with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating, ”They mesmerise you with their passing”, their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the <a href="Laureus%20World%20Sports%20Award%20for%20Team%20of%20the%20Year">Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year</a>.
In the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2011–12 season</a>, Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. Guardiola, who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections, announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant <a href="Tito%20Vilanova">Tito Vilanova</a>. Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> final 3–0, bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching.
It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March. They reached the semi-final stage of both the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> and the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>, going out to Real Madrid and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> respectively. On 19 July, it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.
2014–2020: Bartomeu era.
On 22 July 2013, <a href="Gerardo%20Martino">Gerardo "Tata" Martino</a> was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2013–14 season</a>. Barcelona won the <a href="2013%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">2013 Supercopa de España</a> 1–1 on away goals. On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of <a href="Neymar">Neymar</a>. <a href="Josep%20Maria%20Bartomeu">Josep Maria Bartomeu</a> replaced him to finish the term.
Barcelona won the treble in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2014–15 season</a>, winning La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles, and became the first European team to have won the treble twice. On 17 May, the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid. This was Barcelona's seventh La Liga title in the last ten years. On 30 May, the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> <a href="2015%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">final</a> at Camp Nou. On 6 June, Barcelona won the <a href="2015%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2015 Champions League Final</a> with a 3–1 win against <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, which completed the treble, the club's second in six years. Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed "MSN", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.
On 11 August, Barcelona started the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2015–16</a> season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> 5–4 in the <a href="2015%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2015 UEFA Super Cup</a>. They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate">River Plate</a> in the <a href="2015%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup%20Final">2015 Club World Cup final</a> on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time, with Suárez, Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament. The Club World Cup was Barcelona's 20th international title, a record only matched by Egyptian club <a href="Al%20Ahly%20SC">Al Ahly</a>. By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions, Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, breaking Real Madrid's record of 178 goals scored in 2014. On 10 February 2016, qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons, Luis Enrique's Barcelona broke the club's record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola's team in the 2010–11 season, with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2015–16 Copa del Rey</a>. With a 5–1 win at <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a> on 3 March, Barcelona's 35th match unbeaten, the club broke Real Madrid's Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season. After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten, their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou. On 14 May 2016, Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons. The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.
On 8 March 2017, Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2016–17 UEFA Champions League</a> Round of 16 second Leg, defeating Paris Saint-Germain <a href="Barcelona%206%E2%80%931%20Paris%20Saint-Germain">6–1</a> (aggregate score 6–5), despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0. On 29 May 2017, former player <a href="Ernesto%20Valverde">Ernesto Valverde</a> was named as Luis Enrique's successor. On 20 September 2017, Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the <a href="2017%20Catalan%20independence%20referendum">2017 Catalan referendum</a> saying, "FC Barcelona, in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members, will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people, and will do so in a civil, peaceful, and exemplary way". The match against <a href="UD%20Las%20Palmas">UD Las Palmas</a> on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia, but it (the request) was declined by La Liga, therefore being held behind closed doors. Two directors, Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí, handed in their resignations in protest at the game's being played. Winning La Liga for the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2017–18</a> season, on 9 May 2018, Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the <a href="La%20Liga%20records%20and%20statistics%23Games%20without%20a%20loss">longest unbeaten streak</a> (43 games) in La Liga history. On 27 April 2019, Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title. However, the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20knockout%20phase%23Semi-finals">Champions League exit</a> to Liverpool in the semi-finals, with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory.
On 13 January 2020, following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Spanish Supercup</a>, former <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> coach <a href="Quique%20Seti%C3%A9n">Quique Setién</a> replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona. Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years. On 17 August, the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with <a href="director%20of%20football">director of football</a> <a href="Eric%20Abidal">Eric Abidal</a> also dismissed from his position. Two days later, <a href="Ronald%20Koeman">Ronald Koeman</a> was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona. Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020, to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members.
2021–present: Return of Laporta and post-Messi era.
On 7 March 2021, Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28% of the vote. Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey, their only trophy under Ronald Koeman, after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the <a href="2021%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">final</a>. In August 2021 Barcelona found themselves unable to comply with La Liga's Financial Fair Play requirements, and revealed a club debt of €1.35bn and a wage bill accounting for 103% of total income. Negotiations with Lionel Messi, now in the final year of his contract, had been ongoing for some time. However, on 5 August 2021, Barcelona announced that they would be unable to re-sign Messi to an extension due to La Liga regulations. This was despite the fact that the club and Messi had reached an agreement over the details of a new contract. Messi departed the club after 21 years as a Barça player, and the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and signed on a free transfer with French club <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain">Paris Saint-Germain</a>. The financial implications also restricted Barcelona in the transfer market and as a result most of the incoming players were either free transfers or loans and they had to reduce players' wages to register the incoming players.
Poor performances in <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> and the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> led to the sacking of Ronald Koeman on 28 October, with a club legend <a href="Xavi">Xavi</a> replacing him. Xavi could not reverse the fortunes in the Champions League, and Barcelona dropped down to the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> for the first time since <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2003–04</a>, subsequently exiting in the quarter-finals. In the domestic league, Xavi improved Barça's form and guided them from ninth to second, guaranteeing a Champions League spot next season. However, this also meant Barcelona finished trophyless after earlier Supercopa and Copa del Rey exits.
On 15 January 2023, Xavi guided Barcelona to their first trophy since the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2021 Copa del Rey</a>, as the Catalans defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in the <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a> <a href="2023%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a%20Final">final</a>.
On 10 March 2023, Spanish prosecutors said they had filed a complaint against Barcelona and two of the La Liga club's ex-presidents over alleged payments to a company owned by a senior refereeing official to influence match results. On 23 March 2023, <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> said it had opened an investigation into the club for a potential violation of the European soccer governing body's legal framework regarding payments made by the club to a company owned by a senior refereeing official. Four months later, UEFA announced that it temporarily accepted the club's participation in UEFA competitions, reserving the possibility of taking future measures depending on the evolution of the case, which came to be known as the <a href="Negreira%20case">Negreira case</a>. UEFA obligated FC Barcelona to keep informed of the progress of the ongoing investigations proactively and to provide all the documents and information they request.
Support.
The nickname "culer" for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan "cul" (English: arse), as the spectators at the first stadium, Camp de la Indústria, sat with their "culs" over the stand. In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population. Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club. The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009, the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media. , the club has 150,317 memberships, called "socis".
In addition to membership, there are 1,264 officially registered fan clubs, called "penyes", around the world. The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona. Among the best supported teams globally, Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams, with over 103 million Facebook fans , only behind Real Madrid with 111 million. The club has had many prominent people among its supporters, including Pope <a href="John%20Paul%20II">John Paul II</a>, who was an honorary member, and former prime minister of Spain <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a>.
Club rivalries.
"El Clásico".
There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> is known as "The Classic" ("El Clásico"). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> and <a href="Castile%20%28historical%20region%29">Castile</a>, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between <a href="Catalan%20people">Catalans</a> and the <a href="Castilians">Castilians</a>, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.
As early as the 1930s, Barcelona "had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid". In 1936, when <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> started the "<a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">Coup d'état</a>" against the democratic <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>, the president of Barcelona, <a href="Josep%20Sunyol">Josep Sunyol</a>, member of the <a href="Republican%20Left%20of%20Catalonia">Republican Left of Catalonia</a> and Deputy to <a href="Cortes%20Generales">The Cortes</a>, was arrested and executed without trial by Franco's troops (Sunyol was exercising his political activities, visiting Republican troops north of Madrid). During the dictatorships of <a href="Miguel%20Primo%20de%20Rivera">Miguel Primo de Rivera</a> and especially <a href="Francoist%20Spain">Francisco Franco</a>, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascist-like regime. In this period, Barcelona gained their motto "Més que un club" ("English: More than a club") because of its alleged connection to <a href="Catalan%20nationalism">Catalan nationalist</a> as well as to <a href="progressivism">progressive</a> beliefs.
There's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Aviación</a> and <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Madrid FC</a> (that recovered its "royal" name after the fall of the Republic). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed "CF Barcelona" succeed as "Spanish team" rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful, winning two <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Generalísimo</a> titles and a <a href="Copa%20Eva%20Duarte">Copa Eva Duarte</a>; Barcelona claimed three <a href="List%20of%20Spanish%20football%20champions">league titles</a>, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the <a href="1943%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo">Copa del Generalísimo</a>, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a> to Real Madrid despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20%28footballer%29">Santiago Bernabéu</a>'s "revolution" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for <a href="Nationalist%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Franco's forces</a>, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, helping create the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s. These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. <a href="Fernando%20Maria%20Castiella">Fernando Maria Castiella</a>, who served as <a href="Minister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Spain%29">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that "[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had." Franco died in 1975, and the <a href="Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy">Spanish transition to democracy</a> soon followed. Under his rule, <a href="List%20of%20Real%20Madrid%20CF%20records%20and%20statistics%23Honours">Real Madrid had won</a> 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 <a href="Latin%20Cup">Latin Cup</a>s, and 1 <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a>. In the same period, <a href="List%20of%20FC%20Barcelona%20records%20and%20statistics%23Honours">Barcelona had won</a> 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles, 3 <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>s, and 2 Latin Cups.
The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a>. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for <a href="Club%20Deportivo%20Los%20Millonarios">Los Millionarios</a> in <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, during a players' strike in his native <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to "Los Blancos", signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.
Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>. The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20European%20Cup">1959–60</a> and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup">1960–61</a>. In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the "Match of The Century" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people. An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to <a href="Goal%20celebration">memorable goal celebrations</a> from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain <a href="Carles%20Puyol">Carles Puyol</a> kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.
"El derbi Barceloní".
Barça's local rival has always been <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">Espanyol</a>. "Blanc-i-blaus", being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of <a href="Estadi%20de%20Sarri%C3%A0">Sarrià</a>.
Traditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the <a href="Franco%20regime">regime</a> such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.
In 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue. Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the "derbi" has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.
Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly <a href="El%20derbi%20barcelones%23Head%20to%20Head">dominant</a>. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 87 seasons (1928–2022) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça <a href="1957%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">in 1957</a>. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992, 2016 and 2017). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">season</a>.
Rivalry with AC Milan.
One of Barcelona's rivals in European football is Italian club AC Milan. The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches (19), it is also the third most played match in European club competitions, behind Real Madrid–Juventus (21) and Real Madrid–Bayern Munich (26). Two of the most successful clubs in Europe, Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça's five, while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups. Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles, which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football, with 19 and 14 titles respectively, both behind Real Madrid's 23.
Barcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats. The first encounter between the two clubs was in the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20European%20Cup">1959–60 European Cup</a>. They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score (0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona). While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup, they beat Johan Cruyff's Dream Team 4–0 in the <a href="1994%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">1994 Champions League final</a>, despite being the underdogs. In 2013, however, Barcelona made a "historic" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2012–13 Champions League</a>, winning 4–0 at the Camp Nou.
Ownership and finances.
Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a>, Barcelona is organised as a <a href="Nonprofit%20organization">registered association</a>. Unlike a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a>, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership. The members of Barcelona, called "socis", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club. , the club has 150,317 "socis".
In 2010, "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around €752 million (US$1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008–09 season. According to <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a>, Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated €401 million in revenue. In 2013, "Forbes" magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world, behind Real Madrid and Manchester United, with a value of $2.6 billion. In 2014, "Forbes" ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth $3.2 billion, and Deloitte ranked them the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million. In 2017, "Forbes" ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $3.64 billion. In 2018, Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $1bn in annual revenues. In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year. However, years of profligate spending under the leadership of <a href="Josep%20Maria%20Bartomeu">Josep Maria Bartomeu</a> (president between 2014 and 2020) and other factors, such as the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, saw the club's gross debt rise to about $1.4 billion in 2021, much of it short-term.

The club's highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986. The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stands</a> means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.
"El Barça de les Cinc Copes" is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season (1951–1952). Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-<a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. On 18 December 2009, alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble, Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year (<a href="Sextuple%20%28association%20football%29">Sextuple</a>).

In 2016, Barcelona's <a href="La%20Masia">La Masia</a> was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world.
Kits and crest.
The club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a> and the <a href="Bat%20%28heraldry%29%23The%20bat%20in%20official%20heraldry">bat of King James</a>, and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm. The club shared <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Barcelona">Barcelona's coat of arms</a>, as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one. In 1910, the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the <a href="St%20George%27s%20Cross">St George Cross</a> in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.
The blue and <a href="Shades%20of%20red%23Garnet">garnet</a> colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a> in 1900. Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and garnet design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, <a href="Arthur%20Witty">Arthur Witty</a>, claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the <a href="Merchant%20Taylors%27%20School%2C%20Crosby">Merchant Taylor's School</a> team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's <a href="French%20First%20Republic">First Republic</a>. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, <a href="FC%20Basel">FC Basel</a>.
Since 1998, the club has had a kit deal with <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028 for a record €155 million per year. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>.
Anthems.
Throughout its history, the club has had various official songs. The anthem in use today is El Cant del Barça (The Song of Barça), composed in 1974 on the occasion of the club's 75th anniversary. Authors <a href="Josep%20Maria%20Espin%C3%A0s">Josep Maria Espinàs</a> and Jaume Picas composed the lyrics in Catalan, while the music was composed by <a href="Manuel%20Valls%20%28composer%29">Manuel Valls</a>.
The song was first performed on 27 November 1974 at the Camp Nou stadium before the match between FC Barcelona and the East Germany national team by a 3,500-man choir led by Oriol Martorell. On November 28, 1988, in celebration of the club's centenary, the song was performed by Catalan singer-songwriter <a href="Joan%20Manuel%20Serrat">Joan Manuel Serrat</a> at the end of the festival at the Camp Nou stadium. Since the 2008–09 season, el Cant del Barça has been featured on the official Barcelona jerseys.
On the occasion of the club's 124th anniversary and with the start of preparations for the 125th anniversary, the club presented a new anthem version recording faithful to the essence of the original score and lyrics composed in 1974, with a better quality and enhanced orchestration and vocals. Composed by the Vallès Symphony Orchestra, the Orfeó Català choral society and the Cor Jove youth choir, it is the current official version.
El Cant del Barça is turned on before Barcelona games take place at the Camp Nou, especially during matches against Real Madrid and just before the start of the meeting. The song is also often played for supporters and fans to cheer, chant and celebrate the victory.
Stadium.
Barcelona initially played in the Camp de la Indústria. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.
In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.
After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games. The club began to make plans for a new stadium. The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a>, 336% over budget.
In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu. In preparation for the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Summer Olympics</a> two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline. It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.
In December 2021, a record 88% of the club members voted in favor of the "Espai Barça" project to revamp the club's sporting facilities, being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history. Originally projected to have been completed in 2021, renovation work on Camp Nou began on 1 June 2023 and it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2026, with an estimated €1.5 billion net funding. During the renovation period, Barcelona will move for the entire <a href="2023%E2%80%9324%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2023–24 season</a> to <a href="Estadi%20Ol%C3%ADmpic%20Llu%C3%ADs%20Companys">Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys</a> in Montjuïc, expecting to return in November 2024, with the stadium still under construction.
There are also other facilities, which include:

Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have <a href="Multiple%20citizenship">dual citizenship</a> with an EU country.

It is one club of the ten founding clubs of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>.
History.
Real Racing Club played their first football match on 23 February 1913, losing 1–2 to neighbouring "Strong". It was officially founded on 14 June, as "Santander Racing Club", appearing in its first tournament during that summer (Luis Redonet Trophy) and being admitted to the <a href="Biscay%20Championship">Northern Federation</a> on 14 November, eventually <a href="Mergers%20and%20acquisitions">merging</a> with Santander Football Club.
In the <a href="1929%20La%20Liga">1928–29</a> season, the <a href="La%20Liga">Spanish League</a> competition began. After a complicated elimination process to determine the tenth and final team for the new First Division, Racing successively beat <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>, <a href="Real%20Betis">Betis</a> and <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>. The club was part of the first goalless game in the league, against <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>.
During the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Republic</a>, the classifications of Santander varied. In <a href="1930%E2%80%9331%20La%20Liga">1930–31</a>, It achieved the runner-up position in the Spanish League, tied at 22 points with champion Athletic Bilbao, and third-place <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>. This is the highest finish achieved by the club in all its history, trained by the English <a href="Robert%20Firth%20%28footballer%29">Robert Firth</a> and chaired by Fernando Pombo.
They also participated in the International Tournament of Paris, falling in the semifinal to <a href="SK%20Slavia%20Prague">Slavia of Prague</a> (2–1). In the 1930s, under the presidency of the academic José María de Cossío, it had varied positions, from third place in <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20La%20Liga">(1933–34)</a> to low table rankings. In seasons 1934–35 and 1935–36, Racing played in the <a href="Campeonato%20Regional%20Centro">Commonwealth Championship of Castilla-Aragón</a>, in which it finished second in the first season. Meanwhile, in Cantabria a lesser championship was disputed, not qualifying for the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Spanish Cup</a>; <a href="Santo%C3%B1a%20CF">Santoña</a> won it. During the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20La%20Liga">1935–36</a> season, Racing was the first club in the Spanish league to beat <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> in the four league matches (both home and two as a visitor) in the same season: on 8 December 1935 they won 4–0 against Barcelona in the <a href="Campos%20de%20Sport%20de%20El%20Sardinero">Campos de Sport de El Sardinero</a>, on 15 December they won in Madrid 2–4, on 8 March 1936 they beat Barcelona 2-3 and on 15 March they defeated Madrid 4–3 at El Sardinero. The only player to score in all matches (one goal in each match, and two in Madrid) was Milucho.
In <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1950</a>, the <a href="Cantabria">Cantabria</a>ns returned to the top flight after a ten-year absence, scoring 99 goals in only 30 games.
During the period of <a href="Francoist%20Spain">Francoist Spain</a>, the club was renamed "Real Santander" in 1941, because of the prohibition on non-Spanish names. The name was restored in 1973 as the team <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">returned to the first division</a> one year after <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">nearly relegating</a>, under young manager <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Maguregui">José María Maguregui</a>. Racing was <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20La%20Liga">immediately relegated</a>, And spent the ensuing seasons bouncing between divisions one and two, also <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">being crowned champions</a> in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> (the new third level, created in 1977) in 1991. Veteran <a href="Quique%20Seti%C3%A9n">Quique Setién</a> returned to his main club the following year, helping it <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">return to the top flight</a> and scoring in the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20La%20Liga">1994–95 campaign</a> against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, in a historic 5–0 home win.
Racing was the first Spanish team to wear a sponsor's name on their shirt: German electronics company <a href="Teka">Teka</a> on 27 December 1981 away to <a href="Real%20Madrid">Real Madrid</a> (the corporation then sponsored the opponents early in the following decade).
On 25 March 2000, Racing played its 1,000th game in La Liga.
In the 2000s, Racing only played <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">one season</a> in the second division, winning promotion with Setién as manager. Racing finished the 2005–06 season in the 16th position, just 1 point away from relegation back to Segunda división. The next season was much better, as the club finished 10th, easily retaining its place in the top flight. In <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">2007–08</a>, under <a href="Marcelino%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Toral">Marcelino García Toral</a>, it finished in sixth position, thus <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">qualifying</a> to the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> for the first time ever; additionally the club reached the semifinals of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> twice during this decade, being ousted by eventual runners-up <a href="Getafe%20CF">Getafe CF</a> and <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> in 2008 and 2010, respectively.
On 22 January 2011, Indian business tycoon <a href="Ahsan%20Ali%20Syed">Ahsan Ali Syed</a>, founder and chairman of investment company <a href="Western%20Gulf%20Advisory">Western Gulf Advisory</a>, completed his takeover of Racing de Santander. Following his takeover, he immediately sacked <a href="Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Portugal">Miguel Ángel Portugal</a>. A turbulent <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20La%20Liga">2011–12 season</a> saw the club go through three different managers, all of which were unable to prevent Racing from being relegated to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, bringing an end to their decade stay in the top flight of Spanish football.
At the end of <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the following campaign</a>, Racing again finished at the bottom of the table, sealing their fate of a consecutive relegation. During the season, Racing had also been immersed in a severe institutional and financial crisis. The club’s relegation brought an end to 22 years of playing in Spain’s professional divisions. In spite of that plight, the team was able to reach the quarterfinals in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2013–14 edition of the domestic cup</a> after ousting top-divisioners <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla FC</a> and <a href="UD%20Almer%C3%ADa">UD Almería</a>; in the first leg against the latter, club fans stormed the presidential tribune at "<a href="Estadio%20El%20Sardinero">Estadio El Sardinero</a>" and assaulted chairman Ángel Lavín.
On 27 January 2014, Racing's players, citing several months of unpaid wages, announced they would not play their upcoming cup match unless the club's president and board resigned. Three days later, in the club’s second-leg fixture against <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, the players gathered at the centre circle following kick-off, refusing to play. Referee <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Gil%20Manzano">Jesús Gil Manzano</a> suspended the game after one minute, with Racing being given a loss due to forfeit. As a result of the protest the club was fined and banned from competing in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Copa%20del%20Rey">the following edition of the competition</a>. On 31 January Lavín was sacked, with former player <a href="Juan%20Antonio%20Sa%C3%B1udo">Juan Antonio Sañudo</a> being appointed his successor by practically all the shareholders.
Racing won <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%23Group%201">their group</a> in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2013–14 Segunda División B</a>, and won the <a href="2014%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">playoff</a> against <a href="UE%20Llagostera">Llagostera</a> to be promoted back to the second tier, but they were immediately relegated in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2014–15 season</a>. They again took first place in the Segunda B section in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%23Group%201">2015–16</a>, but were eliminated in <a href="2016%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20playoffs">the promotion playoffs</a>, failing to score a goal across four matches in the ties lost to <a href="Reus%20Deportiu">Reus</a> and <a href="C%C3%A1diz%20CF">Cádiz</a>.
Racing was promoted back to the second division after four years in the third tier in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2018–19</a>, by winning their regional group and defeating <a href="CD%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Baleares">Atlético Baleares</a> in the <a href="2019%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">promotion playoff</a> on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>, but they were immediately relegated in the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2019–20 season</a> after only winning five games out of 42 and finished in last place. They were unable to bounce back to the second tier immediately, finishing fourth then second in the unique small two-phase group setup during <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2020–21 Segunda División B</a> to find themselves remaining at the third level, in the newly formed <a href="Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">Primera División RFEF</a>, for the 2021–22 season. Racing confirmed their finish the season in first place and promoted to <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, after two years in third division and fighting with <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo La Coruña</a> for the top spot. On 3 June 2022, Racing took the inaugural Primera División RFEF title with a 3-0 win over <a href="FC%20Andorra">Andorra</a>.
Rivalries.
Racing Santander is one of few Spanish teams that have played the majority of their history in La Liga, but do not have a <a href="Spanish%20football%20rivalries">major rival</a>, mostly because Racing are the only fully professional team from Cantabria, so there isn't much competition between Racing and any other club from that area, with most others playing at the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">regionalised fourth level</a>; only <a href="Gimn%C3%A1stica%20de%20Torrelavega">Gimnástica de Torrelavega</a> have ever reached the second tier. However, Racing fans generally consider their biggest rival to be the major team from the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a>, <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>, due to geographic proximity and the long history between these clubs. <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a> is the closest city to Santander (approximately ), and the relationship between Racing and Athletic has been described in the past as 'the duel of the North', although the rivalry is dormant as Racing have not played in the top division since 2012.
There is also a minor rivalry between Racing and a club from neighboring <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a>: <a href="Real%20Oviedo">Real Oviedo</a> and an hostility with <a href="Getafe%20CF">Getafe</a>.

SD Compostela

Sociedade Deportiva Compostela is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Santiago%20de%20Compostela">Compostela</a>, <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a>. They play home matches at <a href="Estadio%20Multiusos%20de%20San%20L%C3%A1zaro">San Lázaro</a>, and compete in .
History.
A team called Compostela Foot-ball Club was founded in 1928, ceasing to exist in 1946. On 26 June 1962 a new team was created called Sociedad Recreativa Compostela, and on 28 October 1962 the newly-formed SR Compostela merged with another team, "Club Arenal", changing names to Sociedad Deportiva Compostela. The decade of the 1970s was irregular. The team played in the Tercera División, in the Regional category and in the new Segunda División B. Its first promotion to a semi-national stage occurred in 1977, with a promotion to <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> (Group 1), which lasted just one season; "Compos" promoted again in 1980, this time lasting six years.
Relegation in 1986 was compounded by off-field controversy surrounding the actions of then president Francisco Steppe. He resigned amid allegations of receipt of payments to throw a game against <a href="Pontevedra%20CF">Pontevedra CF</a>, which would assure the opposition's maintenance in the category. The late 1980s saw a significant restructuring of the club both at board and management levels and, in 1990, Compostela regained third-level status.
<a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">The following campaign</a> was to prove the club's most successful to date. On 23 June 1991, a capacity crowd of 8,000 at the "Estadio Municipal Santa Isabel", saw goals from Juanito and Ochoa (two) clinch a 3–1 victory in the final play-off match against <a href="CD%20Badajoz">CD Badajoz</a>, for a first-ever <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> visit.
The move to "<a href="Estadio%20Multiusos%20de%20San%20L%C3%A1zaro">Estadio Multiusos de San Lázaro</a>" coincided with the continuing rise in the team's fortunes and, at the end of <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1993–94</a>, following a 3–1 play-off victory against <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a>, Compostela reached <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>. Compostela did remarkably well, and reached a best finish of 10th in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20La%20Liga">1995–96</a>, mainly courtesy of <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">strikers</a> <a href="Christopher%20Ohen">Christopher Ohen</a> and <a href="Bent%20Christensen%20Arens%C3%B8e">Bent Christensen</a>, whom totalled 23 league goals.
After four seasons at the top, Compostela was relegated after losing a relegation play-off match to <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal CF</a> on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>, despite playing overall attractive football. The club was also about to start a downward spiral; after a relegation to the third level in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2001</a> the team returned the following year but, in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the following campaign</a>, played to a backdrop of off-field distractions, with the players and staff going unpaid for months – a final ninth place was not enough to prevent another relegation, as the club failed to meet the 31 July deadline to settle all wage debts.
Off-field problems.
In the 2001–02 season economic problems arose. However, the squad with <a href="Luis%20%C3%81ngel%20Duque">Luis Ángel Duque</a> as coach managed to achieve promotion to the Segunda División. Off-field problems continued in 2003–04, with the pinnacle being the players, who had not been paid in several months, refusing to appear for a fixture at <a href="UB%20Conquense">UB Conquense</a>, with the subsequent loss of three points. At the season's close, after the actual relegation, Compostela dropped further to the "<a href="Divisiones%20Regionales%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20in%20Galicia">Galician Regional Preferente</a>" (north) after failing again to meet the financial deadline. They played there for two seasons, and folded after the 2005-06 season, when a judge dissolved the institution in the summer of 2006, and auctioned all the club's properties, including the brand name, the trophies and the team's spot in the league. Finally, 26 January 2011, after everything was sold out, the court published the legal liquidation of the entity.
Re-organisation.
Previously to SD Compostela's liquidation in 2006, a new club was created on 1 June 2004 with the name SD Campus Stellae, with José Luís Balboa as president. They entered competition in the 2005-06 season at the group 11 of the <a href="Divisiones%20Regionales%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20in%20Galicia">Galicia Terceira Autonómica</a> league, where he finishes in 11th position (out of 18 teams). The following season, 2006-07, they played in group 12 of the same division, and finished third out of 14 teams.
In 2006, a former president of the dissolved <a href="Sociedad%20Deportiva%20Compostela%20%281962-2006%29">SD Compostela</a>, José María Caneda, bought the commercial name Sociedad Deportiva Compostela, and became president of the SD Campus Stellae, changing the team's name at the beginning of the 2007-08 season to the former club's brand. 
In the 2007–08 season, the new club won its Preferente league and returned to "Tercera". In the following campaign, after finishing first in its group, the team beat <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Monz%C3%B3n">Atlético Monzón</a> with a 4–2 aggregate (3–0, 1–2) and won a second consecutive promotion. However, this would be a short-lived return, with <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">relegation</a> befalling at the season's end, immediately followed by another one due to overwhelming financial problems. Longtime president José María Caneda left the club.

Stadium.
Compostela play at the "<a href="Estadio%20Multiusos%20de%20San%20L%C3%A1zaro">Estadio Multiusos de San Lázaro</a>", which has a capacity of 16,666. Pitch dimensions are 105 x 68 metres.
Compostela played their first season at "Estadio da Residencia da Universidade de Santiago de Compostela", whilst work was completed on their first permanent ground, "Estadio Municipal de Santa Isabel"; on 22 September 1963, it played the first match at the new stadium. It was a basic enclosure and lacked a covered stand until 1969, when a tribune was erected and floodlights installed at a cost of 1 million <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a>. Compostela continued to use the ground for first team fixtures until the end of the 1993 season. The reserve team, Compostela B, played on at "Santa Isabel" until early 2003, when the ground was finally demolished and replaced with a municipal sports centre that bore the same name.
Work started on the "Multiusos de San Lázaro" in 1991. Situated in the eastern suburb of San Lázaro, it was a multi-purpose arena, used primarily for the football matches of its two resident clubs, Compostela and <a href="SD%20Ciudad%20de%20Santiago">SD Ciudad de Santiago</a>. Oval in shape and with a terracotta-coloured roof on the west side to incorporate the directors' seating and press facilities on a second tier, the pitch was surrounded by a 400m athletics track, relatively uncommon in Spanish stadiums.
The inaugural match took place on 24 June 1993, when a four-way tournament was staged, featuring <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a>, <a href="CD%20Tenerife">CD Tenerife</a>, <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate">Club Atlético River Plate</a> and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20FC">São Paulo FC</a>. Deportivo and River played in the first match, and <a href="Bebeto">Bebeto</a> had the honour of scoring the first goal.

Sporting de Gijón

Real Sporting de Gijón, S.A.D. (), commonly known as Real Sporting, Sporting Gijón, or simply Sporting (although in an international context this can lead to confusion with <a href="Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal">Sporting Clube de Portugal</a>) is a Spanish <a href="association%20football">football</a> club from <a href="Gij%C3%B3n">Gijón</a>, <a href="Principality%20of%20Asturias">Principality of Asturias</a>. Founded on 1 July 1905, it plays in the <a href="Segunda%20Division">Segunda Division</a>. Known as "Los Rojiblancos" because of their red and white striped jerseys, their home ground is <a href="El%20Molin%C3%B3n">El Molinón</a> stadium, the oldest professional football ground in Spain, in use since at least 1908. Traditionally their red and white shirts are accompanied by blue shorts with the socks recently also being blue. Its <a href="Asturian%20language">Asturian</a> name is "Real Sporting de Xixón".
The most important milestones of the club were in the 1970s and 1980s, when it finished as runner-up of the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20La%20Liga">1978–79 La Liga</a> and played two finals of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> in <a href="1981%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1981</a> and <a href="1982%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1982</a>.
Real Sporting is also one of only nine Spanish teams that have never played below the second division. Its local rivals are <a href="Real%20Oviedo">Real Oviedo</a> from the neighbouring city slightly inland.
History.
1905–1940: First years.
The club was established in 1905 with the name Sporting Gijonés, Anselmo López being the first club president. The first game of the club is dated on 18 August 1907, against Sport Ovetense. The decline of other local clubs like Gijón Sport Club (founded in 1903) and Sportiva Gijonesa allowed Sporting Gijonés to become the main team in the city. In 1912, King <a href="Alfonso%20XIII">Alfonso XIII</a> accepted the Royal patronage of the club for the Spanish Crown, introducing the term "Real" (Spanish for "Royal") to its name, becoming Real Sporting Club Gijonés.
In 1914, Sporting Gijón won its first <a href="Regional%20Championship%20of%20Asturias">Regional Championship of Asturias</a>, success repeated two years later when the club started the first steps to buy <a href="El%20Molin%C3%B3n">El Molinón</a>, where Sporting started to play its games in 1915. On 2 April 1916, a new change took place to adopt today's denomination, Real Sporting de Gijón. Thanks to the win at the Regional Championship, on 24 April 1917 the club made its debut in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, but was eliminated in the first round by <a href="Arenas%20Club%20de%20Getxo">Arenas Club de Getxo</a>. Sporting lost both games by 0–1 in Gijón and 0–7 at the Basque Country.
On 9 October 1921, Manolo Meana became the first Sporting Gijón player to be called up with the <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spanish national team</a>, for a friendly game against <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a>. In 1929, Sporting Gijón joined <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>. In its <a href="1929%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">first season</a>, the club finished in the fourth position.
1940–1970: Real Gijón era.
From 1940 until 1970, due to a temporary law forbidding the use of foreign words in football club names, the team's official denomination was Real Gijón.
In 1944, the club was promoted to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> for the first time as champion of the <a href="1943%E2%80%9344%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1943–44 Segunda División</a>. The first game in the top tier was played on 24 September 1944, against <a href="RCD%20Espa%C3%B1ol">Español</a> at Sarriá. The game finished without goals. The first goal was scored in the next game against <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a>, by Gundemaro, but the first win did not arrive until the week 6, when the team beat <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Aviaci%C3%B3n">Atlético Aviación</a> by 2–0. Sporting Still is in remaining in La Liga Right now.
Until the 1970s, Sporting alternated both divisions, spending all the decade of the 1960s in Segunda División. At the end of the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1960–61 Segunda División</a> the club was relegated to <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> after losing the relegation playoffs against <a href="Burgos%20CF%20%28I%29">Burgos</a>, but the resignation of <a href="CD%20Condal">Condal</a> to continue playing in the second tier allows Sporting to play a repechage playoff against <a href="Sevilla%20Atl%C3%A9tico">Sevilla Atlético</a> and <a href="CD%20Castell%C3%B3n">Castellón</a>. In the first match, Sporting tied 3–3 against Castellón. The winner of the match would be decided by a <a href="coin%20toss">coin toss</a>. After winning the two previous coin tosses during the match, choosing tails in both, captain <a href="Pepe%20Ortiz">Pepe Ortiz</a> decided to choose again tails, and Sporting became the winner of the game. In the final for remaining in the category, Sporting defeated Sevilla Atlético by 2–1.
1970–1992: The golden years and "EuroSporting".
In 1970, with the name of "Sporting" recovered, the club would start its consolidation in La Liga despite a relegation to Segunda División in 1975. This year would mean the start of the golden era of the club.
Just after promoting in 1976, Sporting Gijón started the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20La%20Liga">1977–78 season</a> by accumulating eight matches without losses. Finally, the "Rojiblancos" finished in the fifth position qualifying for the first time to the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>.
Players like <a href="Quini">Quini</a>, <a href="Cundi%20%28footballer%29">Cundi</a>, <a href="Enzo%20Ferrero">Enzo Ferrero</a> or <a href="Antonio%20Maceda">Antonio Maceda</a> and others would make history in the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">1978–79 club's season</a>, considered the best one in the history of the club. The season started with the first round of the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, where on 13 September 1978, Sporting beat <a href="Torino%20F.C.">Torino</a> 3–0 at El Molinón. In the second round, Sporting was eliminated by <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a>. The club finished the first half of <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> leading the table, tied in points with <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>, but a 0–1 loss to the "Merengues" completely ruined their title hopes.
In 1981, the club played for the first time the Cup <a href="1981%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Final</a>. In the game played at <a href="Estadio%20Vicente%20Calder%C3%B3n">Estadio Vicente Calderón</a> on 18 June 1981, Sporting was defeated 1–3 by <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. Former Sporting Gijón player <a href="Quini">Quini</a>, considered as the most important player in the club's history, scored two goals for the "blaugranas". Sporting repeated success in <a href="1982%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1982</a>, but this time <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> beat the "rojiblancos" 1–2. During the 1980s Sporting accumulated four more participations at UEFA Cup, but always was eliminated in the first round. On 16 September 1987, Sporting won the first leg game against <a href="Arrigo%20Sacchi">Arrigo Sacchi</a>'s <a href="A.C.%20Milan">AC Milan</a>, but a 0–3 defeat in Italy cut off Sporting's possibilities. In the previous <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20La%20Liga">1986–87 season</a>, Sporting beat <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> at <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> by 0–4, the biggest win away in the club's history in La Liga. One year before, Manuel Vega-Arango, president since 1977, left office.
The last UEFA Cup participation was during the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">1991–92 season</a>. Sporting Gijón eliminated <a href="FK%20Partizan">Partizan</a> after a penalty shootout, but failed to defeat <a href="FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti">Steaua București</a> in the second round.
On 6 October 1992, Sporting Gijón played its 1,000th game in La Liga.
1992–2008: Decline of the club.
In 1992, following the law, Real Sporting de Gijón became a <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">Sociedad Anónima Deportiva</a>. Its official name since that moment is "Real Sporting de Gijón, S.A.D." The internal financial crisis and the departure of important players triggers the decline of the club, pushing it to the lower positions in La Liga. In the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">1994–95 season</a>, Sporting remained in La Liga thanks to winning the relegation playoffs against <a href="UE%20Lleida">Lleida</a>, but three years later, following a disastrous <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">1997–98 campaign</a> where Sporting only earned 13 points (two wins and seven draws in 38 games), the club was relegated to <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Second Division</a>, finishing its 21-year continuous stretch in La Liga.
Due to the financial crisis during the 2000s, the club was menaced by its possible dissolution and was forced to sell the <a href="Escuela%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20de%20Mareo">Escuela de Fútbol de Mareo</a> to the Municipal Town Hall for €12m in August 2001. The <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">2003–04 season</a> started with several doubts after the transfer of <a href="David%20Villa">David Villa</a> to <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a> and the election of <a href="Marcelino%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Toral">Marcelino García Toral</a> as head coach, who previously relegated the <a href="Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20B">reserve team</a> to <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>. However, the club was close to promotion to La Liga, but failed to accomplish the goal, finishing in the fifth position. After accumulating €51m of debts in its worst years, Real Sporting was close to being administratively relegated at the end of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">2004–05 season</a>.
2008–2012: Return to La Liga with Manuel Preciado.
With <a href="Manuel%20Preciado%20Rebolledo">Manuel Preciado</a> at the helm of the team since 2006, the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">2007–08 season</a> started with the club unbeaten during the first nine games. Finally, on 15 June 2008, the club secured promotion back to La Liga after beating 2–0 <a href="SD%20Eibar">Eibar</a> in the last round.
In its first season after the return, the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">2008–09</a>, Sporting conceded 20 goals in its first five games, but achieved important wins like the one at <a href="Mestalla">Mestalla</a> against <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> by 3–2 or the 1–0 win against <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>. In a season where the team broke La Liga record of 29 consecutive games without any draw (a 1–1 finish with <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> on 3 May 2009), Sporting avoided relegation in the last round after a win by 2–1 against last qualified <a href="Recreativo%20de%20Huelva">Recreativo de Huelva</a>.
On 2 April 2011, they beat <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> 1–0 at <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> to end Real manager <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a>'s nine-year home league unbeaten run. This was the best <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">season of the club</a> since the last promotion, as it finished in the 10th position.
The <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">2011–12 season</a> started without wins in the first eight games and the team remained in the relegation positions almost all the season. On 31 January 2012, after a 5–1 loss against <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, Manolo Preciado was sacked. The Cantabrian coach ended his era after nearly six years in the club and being very appreciated by all the club supporters. <a href="Javier%20Clemente">Javier Clemente</a> was hired for avoiding the relegation, but despite keeping the possibilities until the last round, failed and the club was condemned to a new relegation, that carried a new financial crisis in the club.
2014–2022: "Los guajes" and a new decline.
On 4 May 2014, <a href="Abelardo%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Abelardo Fernández</a> was appointed as head coach after <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ram%C3%B3n%20Sandoval">José Ramón Sandoval</a> was sacked. In his first season at the first squad, Abelardo could not achieve the promotion to La Liga after being eliminated in the semifinals of the <a href="2014%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20play-offs">play-offs</a> by <a href="UD%20Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a>.
However, the manager extended his contract for two years. Sporting was not allowed to sign any player out from the reserve team during <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">2014–15 season</a> due to the non-payments, but despite this disadvantage, Sporting once again returned to La Liga with a squad where 17 players played before in the reserve team or any of the youth teams of the club. After only two losses in all the season, Sporting promoted in the last round by beating 3–0 <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> at <a href="Estadio%20Benito%20Villamar%C3%ADn">Benito Villamarín stadium</a> and a late equaliser conceded by rival <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona</a> in their separate match against <a href="CD%20Lugo">CD Lugo</a>, when Sporting's game just finished.
During its <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n%20season">comeback season</a>, Sporting had the same sanction due to a delay in payments to the players during the previous season. The club was only allowed to sign, by loan, three new under-23 players without experience in La Liga (<a href="Antonio%20Sanabria">Antonio Sanabria</a> from <a href="A.S.%20Roma">Roma</a>, <a href="Alen%20Halilovi%C4%87">Alen Halilović</a> from Barcelona and <a href="Omar%20Mascarell">Omar Mascarell</a> from Real Madrid).
The season started with a 0–0 draw against Real Madrid, managed by <a href="Rafa%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Rafa Benítez</a>, at <a href="El%20Molin%C3%B3n">El Molinón</a>. Despite an irregular path, Sporting obtained very important wins like a 1–0 at <a href="Mestalla">Mestalla</a>, a 2–1 against <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> or a 5–1 against <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>. After earning a 1–1 draw at <a href="Getafe%20CF">Getafe</a>, the club finally avoided relegation in the last round after beating <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a> by 2–0 and taking advantage of the win of <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> against Getafe. The era of Abelardo ended in January 2017, when he left the club after earning only five points in 15 matches and, despite changing the manager, the club was finally relegated again to Segunda División.
In the successive years, Sporting remained in Segunda División, only playing the promotion play-offs in 2018. The club continued a decline until 2022, where it narrowly avoided relegation to the third division. Abelardo came back to ensure the place in Segunda in the latest four rounds.
2022–present: Grupo Orlegi as new owners.
On 28 June 2022, majority shareholder Javier Fernández sold the club to Mexican group Orlegi Sports by €43m, thus becoming the second highest sale of a club in Spain. Alejandro Irarragorri the first foreign President of the club.

Albacete Balompié

Albacete Balompié is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football team</a> based in <a href="Albacete">Albacete</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Castile%E2%80%93La%20Mancha">Castile–La Mancha</a>. Founded on 5 July 1939, it currently plays in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, the second tier of Spanish football, holding home matches at "<a href="Estadio%20Carlos%20Belmonte">Estadio Carlos Belmonte</a>", with a capacity of 17,524.
History.
This team is from Albacete a city in Castilla-La Mancha. It's been reported in at least four sources that football was first taught in <a href="Albacete">Albacete</a> by John Hulse, an English Engineer of the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways Company</a>, establishing the foundation of <a href="Locomotoras%20Albacete">Locomotoras Albacete</a>, after the same-named steam locomotive factory in the city, owned by the Goicoechea family, owners of <a href="Talgo">Talgo</a>. Thus, like in Swindon, football in Albacete is originally linked to the railway industry. Hulse introduced the Sheffield Rules in Albacete, and some of the first matches to be reported are against recreational clubs from <a href="Region%20of%20Murcia">Murcia</a> (1897), Alcázar de San Juan (1899), and <a href="Villarrobledo">Villarrobledo</a> (1899).
After years of amateur and regional development of football, it would not appear formally until the end of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The club was founded in 1939 under the name Albacete Foot-ball Association, being later changed in an attempt to make it sound "more Spanish". At the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second division</a> in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1985–86</a>, repeating the feat five seasons later.
In 1989, <a href="Benito%20Floro">Benito Floro</a> consecutively promoted the club from <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">the third division</a> to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, overachieving for a seventh place in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20La%20Liga">the first season in the top level</a>. Floro would later coach <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, returning to "Alba" two seasons later as the club was relegated in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20La%20Liga">1995–96</a>.
After years in the second division facing serious economic and sporting difficulties, Albacete returned to the top flight in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2002–03 campaign</a>, led by César Ferrando (later of <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>). However, Albacete dropped in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20La%20Liga">2004–05</a> after posting just 6 wins from 38 matches, going on to stabilize in the subsequent seasons in the second level.
The <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2010–11 season</a> brought two coaching changes, with both <a href="Antonio%20Calder%C3%B3n">Antonio Calderón</a> and <a href="David%20Vidal">David Vidal</a> (who returned to the club only a few months after leaving) being fired, as Albacete returned to the third division after 21 years. That season the club finished last in Segunda División with only 32 points in 42 matches. On 6 December 2011, <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Iniesta">Andrés Iniesta</a> – who played for the club in his youth before joining <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> – became the club's major shareholder, donating <a href="Euro">€</a>420,000 to the cash-strapped club. The club managed to reach the round of 16 of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2011–12 Copa del Rey</a>, notably beating Atlético Madrid 3–1 on aggregate.
In March 2013, Agustín Lázaro, chief executive officer (CEO) of Andrés Iniesta's <a href="winery">winery</a> enterprise, was appointed as Albacete's chairman. In June, Iniesta loaned the club a further €240,000 to cover unpaid wages, thus preventing its administrative relegation to the fourth tier.
In 2014, Albacete returned to the Segunda División, but was relegated two seasons later after finishing the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">season</a> in the 21st position. The club again returned to the Segunda División in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2016–17 season</a> after winning against <a href="Valencia%20Mestalla">Valencia Mestalla</a> in the last round of the <a href="2017%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">promotion play-offs</a>. Albacete finished the 2018–19 season in 4th position of the Segunda División, but then lost to <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">RCD Mallorca</a> in the La Liga play-offs and remained in Segunda División for the 2019–20 season. On next season, Albacete finished last in second division and were relegated to the third division. Thus ending their four-years stay in the second division.
Albacete promoted to Segunda in the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">2021–22 Primera RFEF season</a> playoffs, by defeating <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a> in their home turf.

Very little is officially reported, being one of the most notable games of the time a knock-out stage in 1896 against Locomotoras Albacete Balón-Pie, precursor of the latter <a href="Albacete%20Balompi%C3%A9">Albacete Balompié</a>, in a national cup championship.
During the 1910s, the club won three non-official <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>n regional cups, and became the first Spanish side to defeat a <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> team, winning against <a href="Sporting%20Clube%20de%20Portugal">Sporting Clube de Portugal</a>. In 1940, it first reached "<a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>", only lasting however one year and not returning until 1957. Since 1965, the team also began hosting the "<a href="Trofeo%20Colombino">Trofeo Colombino</a>".
Later years.
In <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1977–78</a>, led by, amongst others, former <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> youth graduate <a href="Hip%C3%B3lito%20Rinc%C3%B3n">Hipólito Rincón</a>, Recreativo first gained promotion to the <a href="La%20Liga">top flight</a>. After just one season, it returned to level two, staying there until 1990, the year of a "<a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>" relegation.
In <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1999–2000</a>, Recreativo were due to be relegated to the third division, but were redeemed when <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> descended into the second and thus <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20B">their reserves</a> were ejected. With a <a href="Estadio%20Nuevo%20Colombino">new stadium</a> and the appointment of <a href="Luis%20Alcaraz">Luis Alcaraz</a> as manager, and the club returned to the top flight for the first time in 23 years on 19 May 2002 with a 2–1 home win over fellow Andalusians <a href="Xerez%20CD">Xerez CD</a>. After this <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20La%20Liga">one season at the top</a>, the team was immediately relegated back. However, in the same campaign, it <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Copa%20del%20Rey">reached the final</a> of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> for the first time, being defeated by <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">Mallorca</a> 0–3 in <a href="Elche">Elche</a>.
In <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2005–06</a>, after beating <a href="CD%20Numancia">Numancia</a> on 4 June 2006, <a href="Marcelino%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Toral">Marcelino García Toral</a>'s Recreativo mathematically secured promotion with two matches left to be played. Ahead of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">new season</a>, the club bought players including France youth international striker <a href="Florent%20Sinama%20Pongolle">Florent Sinama Pongolle</a> from <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, and young winger <a href="Santi%20Cazorla">Santi Cazorla</a> from <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal CF</a>, with a budget of only €15 million. The club finished eighth in the table, at 54 points, a best-ever, and made headlines with a 3–0 win against Real Madrid at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a>. The club's leading goalscorer was Sinama Pongolle with 12 goals to his name, while García Toral left at its conclusion for <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Racing de Santander</a>.
"Recre" narrowly avoided relegation the following season, and in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">2008–09</a>, one win in its last 15 matches led to it coming in last place and returning to "Segunda" after three years. Overspending in aim of returning to the top flight led to debts. At the end of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2014–15 season</a>, the team fell into Segunda B for the first time in 18 years. A year later, the club was nearing extinction due to financial problems. In May 2021, due to restructuring of the <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football league system</a>, the club was relegated two tiers to the fifth level for the first time in its history. Journalist Damián Ortiz of the "Diario de Huelva" called the entire squad "bastards without honour" and "a black mark on the history of Recreativo de Huelva". In April 2022, "Recre" achieved promoted back to fourth division. In June 2023, "Recre" achieved second consecutive promoted to third division after beating <a href="CP%20Cacere%C3%B1o">Cacereño</a> in <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20Segunda%20Federaci%C3%B3n">last playoff</a>.

Real Oviedo

Real Oviedo (<a href="Asturian%20language">Asturian</a>: Real Uviéu) is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football club</a> based in <a href="Oviedo">Oviedo</a>, <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a>. Founded on 26 March 1926, the club plays in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, the second tier of the <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football league system</a>.
The club plays at the <a href="Estadio%20Carlos%20Tartiere">Estadio Carlos Tartiere</a>, opened on 30 September 2000, and is the largest sports stadium in Asturias. In the <a href="La%20Liga%23All-time%20La%20Liga%20table">all-time league table</a> for the Spanish top division, Oviedo ranks in 18th
place.
Its local rivals are <a href="Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n">Sporting Gijón</a> on the sea coast to its north, with whom the club contests the <a href="Asturian%20derby">Asturian derby</a>.
History.
Founded in 1926 after a <a href="Mergers%20and%20acquisitions">merger</a> of "Stadium Ovetense" and "Real Club Deportivo Oviedo." The first one was founded by young people who had studied in England, where the "foot-ball" was already popular. And the second club was founded a few years later by a split in the first. Oviedo first reached <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> seven years later.
Their attacking quartet of <a href="Emil%C3%ADn%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20September%201912%29">Emilín</a>, Galé, <a href="Eduardo%20Herrera%20Bueno">Herrerita</a> and <a href="Isidro%20L%C3%A1ngara">Isidro Lángara</a> (all represented <a href="Spain%20men%27s%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a> in this period), as well as Casuco and Ricardo Gallart modernised the game with their pace and running off the ball tied with sharp passing and one-touch football, played in a style 30/40 years before its time, being dubbed "Delanteras Eléctricas" ("The electric forwards"); all this was connected with a rigid training and fitness regime started by a former manager of the club, Englishman <a href="Fred%20Pentland">Fred Pentland</a>. Lángara won the <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">Pichichi Trophy</a> three years in a row prior to the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, as Oviedo broke all scoring records (174 goals in 62 league games). With the outbreak of the conflict, however, the team broke up: Lángara emigrated to <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, Herrerita and Emilín signed with <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, Galé with <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Racing de Santander</a> and Gallart with <a href="Racing%20de%20Ferrol">Racing de Ferrol</a>.
When football in the country resumed in 1939, Oviedo could not play <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20La%20Liga">1939–40 season</a>, as their pitch was deemed unplayable – <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>'s troops had used the stadium as an ammunition dump. During the following decades, the club bounced back between the first and second levels, the high point being a best-ever third position in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20La%20Liga">1962–63</a> (ranking joint-first with <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> after the first 15 rounds), while the lowest was the side's first relegation to "<a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>", in 1978 (for a single season).
With the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> to be held <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">on home soil in 1982</a>, the "<a href="Estadio%20Carlos%20Tartiere%20%281932%29">Carlos Tartiere Stadium</a>" was completely renewed, the first match being held with the <a href="Chile%20national%20football%20team">Chile national team</a>, 0–0. In 1984–85 Oviedo won the soon-to-be-defunct <a href="Copa%20de%20la%20Liga">Spanish League Cup</a> (second division), after successively defeating <a href="UD%20Salamanca">UD Salamanca</a>, <a href="Bilbao%20Athletic">Bilbao Athletic</a>, <a href="C.F.%20Lorca%20Deportiva%20%281969%29">CF Lorca Deportiva</a>, <a href="CE%20Sabadell%20FC">CE Sabadell FC</a> and <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20B">Atlético Madrileño</a> (the latter with a 2–1 aggregate in the final).
In 1988 Oviedo returned to the top division, after ousting <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">RCD Mallorca</a> in the promotion playoffs (2–1 on aggregate, with <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> <a href="Carlos%20Mu%C3%B1oz%20Cobo">Carlos</a>, who would feature prominently for the club in the following years, scoring one of the goals), and remained in that level for 13 consecutive seasons – in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20La%20Liga">1990–91</a> it finished sixth, <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20UEFA%20Cup">qualifying</a> for the first time for Europe, and being knocked out in the first round by <a href="Genoa%20C.F.C.">Genoa C.F.C.</a> of <a href="Italy">Italy</a> (2–3). Oviedo bounced back from that defeat immediately, with a 2–1 win at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> over Barcelona.After that successful year, there were more brilliant seasons and others where relegation was narrowly dodged (in 1998 Real Oviedo succeeded in a <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20La%20Liga%23Relegation%20playoff">relegation playoff</a> to stay up after beating <a href="UD%20Las%20Palmas">UD Las Palmas</a>). In a nutshell, the "Carbayones" had an outstanding run in La Liga during the 1990s with a team which lined up top international players. In 1992 Real Oviedo as well as most Spanish football clubs was forced to become <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">public limited sports company</a>. The initial capital stock for Real Oviedo amounted to €3.6 million.
On 4 October 1995, Real Oviedo played its 1,000th game in La Liga.
In 2000, the new "<a href="Estadio%20Carlos%20Tartiere">Carlos Tartiere Stadium</a>" with 30,500 seats became Real Oviedo's new ground. It was officially opened on 20 September 2000 with a match between Real Oviedo and <a href="Partizan%20Belgrade">Partizan Belgrade</a>, where Real Oviedo lost 0–2 to the Serbian side. Three days before, Real Oviedo and UD Las Palmas had got a 2–2 draw on the first fixture in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20La%20Liga">2000–01 season</a>.
After being relegated two consecutive times, Real Oviedo suffered severe economic troubles, which, when coupled with a profound lack of institutional support from the city's government, resulted in the team's inability to pay its players. The club was then forced to drop all the way to the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">fourth division</a> of <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football</a>, for the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2003–04 season</a>; at this point the team nearly folded but eventually recovered and regrouped, returning to level three in the following campaign.
Oviedo lasted two further campaigns before dropping down a level again. In another playoff against a Mallorca team – this time <a href="RCD%20Mallorca%20B">the reserves</a>, the club returned again to the third division, after a <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootout</a>; however, its survival remained at risk in the following years, due to continuing financial difficulties.
The financial dire straits continued into the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2012–13 season</a>, when Oviedo called on supporters to buy shares in the club. A few footballers, notably <a href="Santi%20Cazorla">Santi Cazorla</a>, <a href="Juan%20Mata">Juan Mata</a>, <a href="Michu">Michu</a> and <a href="Adri%C3%A1n%20L%C3%B3pez%20%C3%81lvarez">Adrián</a> who all started their careers there, offered their financial support in an attempt to save the club from bankruptcy – the club had until 17 November to raise <a href="Euro">€</a>2 million in order to prevent closure.
On 17 November 2012, <a href="Carlos%20Slim">Carlos Slim</a>, at the time the richest person in the world, invested <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>2.5 million in the club, therefore gaining a controlling stake.
On 31 May 2015, Oviedo confirmed their return to the Spanish <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> after a thirteen-year absence with a 2–1 aggregate victory over <a href="C%C3%A1diz%20CF">Cádiz</a> in the <a href="2015%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">2015 Segunda División B play-offs</a>.

Athletic Bilbao

Athletic Club (; ), commonly known as just Athletic, is a Spanish professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> club based in the city of <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a> in the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a> of <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. They are known as "Los Leones" (The Lions) because their stadium was built near a church called "San Mamés", which was named after <a href="Saint%20Mammes%20of%20Caesarea">Saint Mammes</a>, an early Christian thrown to the lions by the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a>. Mammes pacified the lions and was later made a <a href="saint">saint</a>. The team plays its home matches at the <a href="San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium">San Mamés Stadium</a>. Its home colours are red and white-striped shirts with black shorts.
Athletic are the fourth most successful club in "La Liga" with eight titles to their name. In the table of titles, Athletic is second only to Barcelona, having won it 23 times. It is also the most successful Basque football club in both league and cup titles won. The club also has one of the most successful <a href="Athletic%20Club%20Femenino">women's teams</a> in Spain, which has won five championships in the "<a href="Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20%28women%29">Primera División Femenina</a>".
The club is one of three founding members of the "<a href="La%20Liga">Primera División</a>" that have <a href="List%20of%20unrelegated%20association%20football%20clubs">never been relegated</a> from the top division since its inception in 1929, the others being <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. These three clubs, along with <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a>, are the only four professional clubs in Spain that are not sports corporations; instead they are owned and operated by club members. Athletic's main rivals are <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, against whom it contests the <a href="Basque%20derby">Basque derby</a>, and Real Madrid, due to <a href="El%20Viejo%20Cl%C3%A1sico">sporting and political identity</a>; a minor rivalry also exists with Barcelona due to <a href="Athletic%E2%80%93Barcelona%20cl%C3%A1sico">historical significance</a>. At various points in the club's history, further <a href="Basque%20football%20derbies">Basque league derbies</a> have been contested against <a href="Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s">Alavés</a>, <a href="SD%20Eibar">Eibar</a> and Osasuna.
The club is known for its "<a href="Athletic%20Bilbao%20cantera">cantera</a>" policy of bringing young <a href="Basques">Basque</a> players through the ranks, as well as recruiting players from other Basque clubs. Athletic's <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao%20signing%20policy">official policy</a> is to sign players native to or trained in football in the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">greater Basque Country</a>, which includes <a href="Biscay">Biscay</a>, <a href="Gipuzkoa">Gipuzkoa</a>, <a href="%C3%81lava">Álava</a> and <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a> (in Spain), as well as <a href="Labourd">Labourd</a>, <a href="Soule">Soule</a> and <a href="Lower%20Navarre">Lower Navarre</a> (in France). Since 1912, Athletic has played exclusively with players meeting its own criteria to be deemed Basque. This can be seen as a unique case in European football; it has gained Athletic both admirers and critics. The club has been praised for promoting home grown players and club loyalty. The rule does not apply to coaching staff, with several examples of non-Basques both from Spain and abroad having coached the first team.
Despite the implications of the name 'Athletic Club' in English, and unlike some of the other major Spanish teams which have several departments, it is not a <a href="multi-sport%20club">multi-sport club</a>, participating only in football, although sections for <a href="Cycle%20sport">cycling</a> and other sports existed prior to the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> in the 1930s.
History.
Bilbao FC, Athletic Club, and Club Bizcaya.
Football was introduced to <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a> by two distinct groups with British connections: British workers, and Basque students returning from schools in Britain. In the late 19th century, Bilbao was a leading industrial town, thus becoming the home to a large British colony, mainly made up of migrant workers, including shipyard workers and miners from the northeast of England, such as <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, and <a href="Sunderland">Sunderland</a>. Along with coal, they brought with them (as in so many other parts of the world) the game of football. Meanwhile, sons of the <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> educated classes, such as <a href="Juan%20Astorquia">Juan Astorquia</a>, went to Britain to complete their studies, and while there, they developed a deep interest in football, so when they returned they began to organize games with British workers at the <a href="Hippodrome%20of%20Lamiako">Hippodrome of Lamiako</a>, which at the time was the home of organized football in Biscay.
In 1898, Juan Astorquia and 6 other Basque students belonging to the Gymnasium Zamacois, began to practice football in Lamiako. Three years later, in 1901, at a meeting held at the "Café García", this group of football pioneers, now larger, began conversations to become a legalized official football club, which they called "Athletic Club", using the English spelling. <a href="Luis%20M%C3%A1rquez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201876%29">Luis Márquez</a> became the <a href="List%20of%20Athletic%20Bilbao%20presidents">club's first president</a>, while Astorquia and <a href="Alfred%20Mills%20%28footballer%29">Alfred Mills</a> (the club's only foreign-born founder) were named the team's captain and vice-captain, but in 1902, Astorquia replaced Márquez as president, ruling from 1902 until 1903. Under his presidency, Athletic and their city rivals <a href="Bilbao%20Football%20Club">Bilbao Football Club</a> reached an agreement to combine the best players of both sides to form a team known as <a href="Bizcaya%20%28football%20team%29">"Club Bizcaya"</a>, which was created to compete in the <a href="1902%20Copa%20de%20la%20Coronaci%C3%B3n">Copa de la Coronación</a> (forerunner of the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> which officially began a year later) held in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>; Bizcaya returned to Bilbao with the trophy after beating <a href="Joan%20Gamper">Joan Gamper</a>'s <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> 2–1 in the <a href="1902%20Copa%20de%20la%20Coronaci%C3%B3n%20Final">final</a>. On 24 March 1903, Bilbao FC and its associates were officially and definitively absorbed by Athletic Club.
In the same year, Basque students also formed an affiliated team, "Athletic Club Madrid", which later evolved into <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, after watching Athletic's epic triumph in the <a href="1903%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1903 Copa del Rey Final</a>. The club itself declares 1898 as its foundation date.
Pichichi and Copa del Rey.
The club featured prominently in early Copas del Rey. Following their triumph at the Copa de la Coronación by <a href="Bizcaya%20%28football%20team%29">"Club Bizcaya"</a>, the newly formed Athletic Bilbao won the very first Copas del Rey in <a href="1903%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1903</a>, both times under Juan Astorquia who was president and Captain. In <a href="1904%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1904</a>, they were declared winners after their opponents failed to turn up. In 1907, they revived the name "Club Vizcaya" after entering a combined team with "Union Vizcaino". After a brief lull, they won again in <a href="1910%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1910</a>, with <a href="Luis%20Astorquia">Luis Astorquia</a> as the new captain and goalkeeper.
In 1911, former team captain <a href="Alejandro%20de%20la%20Sota%20%28footballer%29">Alejandro de la Sota</a>, was elected as the 7th president of the club, and he was the driving force behind the construction of the <a href="San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%281913%29">San Mamés Stadium</a> (whose architect was Manuel María Smith), which opened in 1913 and soon become one of the symbols of Athletic's dominance in the 1910s, winning the Copa del Rey three times in a row between <a href="1914%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1914</a> and <a href="1916%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1916</a>, with <a href="Billy%20Barnes%20%28footballer%29">Billy Barnes</a> as coach. Between 1917 and 1919 the club went through a period of institutional crisis and during that time it did not participate in the Copa del Rey. In 1920, with the return of Billy Barnes, Athletic once again participated in the national championship and in 1921 won the Copa del Rey again.
The star of this team was <a href="Pichichi%20%28footballer%29">Pichichi</a>, a prolific goalscorer who scored the very first goal at the San Mamés on 21 August 1913 and a <a href="hat-trick%23Association%20football">hat-trick</a> in the <a href="1915%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1915 final</a>. The last championship won by Pichichi was the 1921 Copa del Rey, before dying aged just 29 in 1922. Today, the La Liga top-scorer is declared the <a href="The%20Pichichi%20Trophy">"Pichichi"</a> in his honour.
Eight championships at 1930s.
Along with fellow Basque clubs such as <a href="Real%20Uni%C3%B3n">Real Unión</a>, <a href="Arenas%20Club%20de%20Getxo">Arenas Club de Getxo</a> and <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, Athletic was a founding member of <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in 1928 and by 1930 they were joined by <a href="Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s">CD Alavés</a>; five of the ten clubs in the "Primera División" were from the Basque Country. The saying "Con cantera y afición, no hace falta importación", translated as "With home-grown teams and support, there is no need for import", made sense during these early days.
In 1922, a new English coach, <a href="Fred%20Pentland">Fred Pentland</a>, arrived; in 1923, he led the club to victory in the Copa del Rey. He revolutionised the way Athletic played, favouring the short-passing game. In 1927, Pentland left Athletic but returned in 1929 and led the club to La Liga/Copa del Rey doubles in 1930 and 1931. The club won the Copa del Rey four times in a row between 1930 and 1933 and they were also La Liga runners-up in 1932 and 1933. In 1931, Athletic defeated Barcelona 12-1, the latter's worst defeat and the biggest win in LaLiga history.
Athletic's success under English coaches continued with <a href="William%20Garbutt">William Garbutt</a>. His first season in Spain was a massive success as he managed to win the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20La%20Liga">Liga</a> that year. He had inherited a talented squad that included one of the best strikers in the club's history, known as "Primera delantera histórica" (<a href="English%20language">en</a>: "First historic attack"), formed by <a href="Lafuente%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201907%29">Lafuente</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Iraragorri">Iraragorri</a>, <a href="Bata%20%28footballer%29">Bata</a> (top scorer of LaLiga in 1930-31), <a href="Ignacio%20Agirrezabala">Chirri II</a> and <a href="Guillermo%20Gorostiza">Gorostiza</a> (top scorer of LaLiga in 1929-30 and 1931–32). Goalkeeper <a href="Gregorio%20Blasco">Gregorio Blasco</a> also stood out, who was the most unbeaten goalie in LaLiga on three occasions.
Garbutt promoted the young <a href="%C3%81ngel%20Zubieta">Ángel Zubieta</a> to the first team, a player who at 17 years of age went on to become the youngest ever to play for the Spanish national team at the time. In the final game of the season, the title was decided when Athletic defeated Oviedo 2–0 at home on 19 April 1936, winning the title just two points clear of Real Madrid. In July 1936, football halted due to the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The league did not restart until the <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20La%20Liga">1939–40 season</a>. Athletic Club did not win the title again until <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20La%20Liga">1943</a> and by that time Garbutt had been exiled.
Zarra and the "second historic attack".
In 1941, the club was forced to change its name to Atlético Bilbao, following <a href="Language%20politics%20in%20Francoist%20Spain">a decree issued by Franco</a>, who also changed the name of the Copa del Rey to Copa del Generalísimo, in reference to his own figure.
A year before <a href="Telmo%20Zarra">Telmo Zarra</a> made his debut, who became one of the club's great legends and the top scorer in its history with 335 goals. He won six Pichichi Trophies for being the top scorer in LaLiga (a record only surpassed by Messi in 2020), and his 38 goals in the <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20La%20Liga">1950–51</a> season stood as a record for 60 years. He was also the top scorer in LaLiga history since 1950 with 251 goals, until in 2014 he was surpassed by <a href="Lionel%20Messi">Lionel Messi</a> and later by <a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> (however, he is still the top Spanish scorer in the championship).
During the 1940s and early 1950s, the club featured the legendary forward line formed by <a href="Rafa%20Iriondo">Iriondo</a>, <a href="Venancio%20Garc%C3%ADa">Venancio</a>, Zarra, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Panizo">Panizo</a> and <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Ga%C3%ADnza">Gaínza</a>, which was nicknamed "Segunda delantera histórica" (en: "Second historic attack"); midfielder <a href="Nando%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Nando</a> and goalkeeper <a href="Raimundo%20Lezama">Lezama</a> (winner of a <a href="Ricardo%20Zamora%20Trophy">Zamora Trophy</a> in <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20La%20Liga">1946-47</a>) also stood out from this team. This squad won a <a href="double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> in <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20La%20Liga">1943</a> and retained Copa del Generalísimo in both <a href="1944%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1944</a> and <a href="1945%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1945</a>. They helped the club win another Copa del Generalísimo and a <a href="Copa%20Eva%20Duarte">Copa Eva Duarte</a> (the official precedent of the <a href="Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a>) in <a href="1950%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1950</a>.
The team of "eleven villagers".
In 1954, coach <a href="Ferdinand%20Dau%C4%8D%C3%ADk">Ferdinand Daučík</a> retired the team of "second historic attack" and gave way to a new generation of players. Daučík managed to form a new champion team that won the double in <a href="1955-56%20La%20Liga">1956</a> and two other victories in the Generalissimo Cup in <a href="1955%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1955</a> and <a href="1958%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1958</a>. The latter is remembered as one of the club's most important achievements, because Athletic managed to beat <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Di Stefano</a>'s <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>, which had just won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> and LaLiga, and the Spanish federation also ignored Athletic's request to play in a neutral field and forced the final to be played in <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Chamartin</a> (Real Madrid stadium). However, the Bilbao team won the match 2-0 with goals from <a href="Eneko%20Arieta">Arieta</a> and <a href="Mauri%20%28Spanish%20footballer%29">Mauri</a>, and lifted the Cup in Chamartin Stadium. From that moment on, this was remembered as "el equipo de los once aldeanos" (en: "the team of eleven villagers"), since club president Enrique Guzmán shouted during the title celebration: "With eleven villagers, we have beaten them to death!", in allusion to the club's tradition of playing only with players from its homeland. The classic team lineup was: <a href="Carmelo%20Cedr%C3%BAn">Carmelo</a>; <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Or%C3%BAe">Orue</a>, <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Garay">Garay</a>, <a href="Canito%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201931%29">Canito</a>; <a href="Mauri%20%28Spanish%20footballer%29">Mauri</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Maguregui">Maguregui</a>, <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Marcaida">Marcaida</a>; <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Artetxe">Arteche</a>, <a href="Eneko%20Arieta">Arieta</a> (whom they considered Zarra's successor), <a href="Ignacio%20Uribe">Uribe</a> and <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Ga%C3%ADnza">Gaínza</a>.
In 1956 the club also made their debut in the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a>, where they reached the quarterfinals after eliminating <a href="FC%20Porto">FC Porto</a> and <a href="Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s">Ferenc Puskás</a>'s <a href="Budapest%20Honv%C3%A9d%20FC">Honvéd FC</a>. They then beat <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> <a href="Busby%20Babes">Busby Babes</a> 5-3 at <a href="San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%281913%29">San Mamés Stadium</a>, but were defeated 3-0 at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, in a match in which goalkeeper <a href="Carmelo%20Cedr%C3%BAn">Carmelo</a> had to play almost the entire match injured because substitutions did not exist at that time.
Iribar and the first European final.
The 1960s were dominated by Real Madrid, and Atlético went through a few years of transition in which the only figure that shone was goalkeeper <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20%C3%81ngel%20Iribar">José Ángel Iribar</a>, who became one of the club's greatest legends along with Zarra. Due to the team's bad form, the fans used to constantly repeat the phrase "Juegan Iribar y diez más" (<a href="English%20language">en</a>: "Iribar and ten more are playing"). The situation improved when in <a href="1969%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1969</a> Atlético won a Copa del Generalísimo and was runner-up in LaLiga in the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20La%20Liga">1969–70</a> season. The main stars of this team −in addition to Iribar− were the scorer <a href="Fidel%20Uriarte">Fidel Uriarte</a> (winner of a <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">Pichichi Trophy</a>) and the winger <a href="Txetxu%20Rojo">Txetxu Rojo</a>.
The 1970s were not much better, with only another single Copa del Generalísimo win in <a href="1973%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1973</a>. In December 1976, before a game against Real Sociedad, Iribar and Sociedad captain <a href="Inaxio%20Kortabarria">Inaxio Kortabarria</a> carried out the <a href="Ikurri%C3%B1a">Ikurriña</a> (the <a href="Basque%20nationalism">Basque nationalist</a> flag), and placed it ceremonially on the centre-circle – this was the first public display of the flag since the death of <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>. By then the Franco regime also ended and the club reverted to using the name "Athletic". In 1977, the club reached <a href="1977%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">the final</a> of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> after eliminating teams like <a href="AC%20Milan">AC Milan</a> or <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, among others, and only losing on <a href="Away%20goals%20rule">away goals</a> to <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>. They also reached the Copa del Rey final, which they lost to <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> on penalties (Iribar missed the decisive one, which gave the Sevillians the victory), and reached third position in LaLiga. Despite these defeats, this is remembered as one of the best teams in the history of Athletic Bilbao, which included historical players of the club such as Iribar, Rojo, <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Guisasola">Guisasola</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ram%C3%B3n%20Alexanko">Alexanko</a>, <a href="Andoni%20Goikoetxea">Goikoetxea</a>, <a href="Javier%20Irureta">Irureta</a>, <a href="Dani%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201951%29">Dani</a> or <a href="Carlos%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201948%29">Carlos</a> (last player to win the <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">Pichichi Trophy</a> with the club).
The Clemente years.
In 1981, <a href="Javier%20Clemente">Javier Clemente</a> became manager. He put together one of the most successful teams in the club's history, the main lineup of this team was: <a href="Andoni%20Zubizarreta">Zubizarreta</a>; <a href="Santiago%20Urquiaga">Urkiaga</a>, <a href="Andoni%20Goikoetxea">Goikoetxea</a>, <a href="I%C3%B1igo%20Liceranzu">"Rocky" Liceranzu</a>, <a href="Luis%20de%20la%20Fuente%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201961%29">De la Fuente</a>; <a href="Miguel%20de%20Andr%C3%A9s">De Andrés</a>, <a href="Miguel%20Sola">Sola</a>, <a href="Ismael%20Urtubi">Urtubi</a>; <a href="Dani%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201951%29">Dani</a>, <a href="Manuel%20Sarabia">Sarabia</a> and <a href="Estanislao%20Argote">Argote</a>. In <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20La%20Liga">1982–83</a> season, Athletic became LaLiga champion after surpassing <a href="Santillana%20%28footballer%29">Santillana</a>'s <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> in the standings on the last round. The following year they won a LaLiga and Copa del Rey double. In that cup final they beat <a href="Diego%20Maradona">Maradona</a>'s <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> 1-0; the Argentine player did not take the defeat well and attacked an Athletic player, which caused a brawl between both teams. Months earlier, Goikoetxea had injured Maradona after a hard tackle from behind, from which it took him several weeks to recover, and the Bilbao native was sanctioned with 14 games without playing (although the match referee did not show him any card for this fact).
In 1985 and 1986, Athletic finished third and fourth respectively. During the 1985-86 season Clemente was fired due to a bad relationship with the team's star, Sarabia. A succession of coaches that included José Ángel Iribar, <a href="Howard%20Kendall">Howard Kendall</a>, <a href="Jupp%20Heynckes">Jupp Heynckes</a> and <a href="Javier%20Irureta">Javier Irureta</a> and even a returning Clemente failed to reproduce his success.
The Fernández era.
In 1998, coach <a href="Luis%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Luis Fernández</a> led the club to second in La Liga and <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> qualification. Fernández benefited from the club adopting a more flexible approach to the "<a href="cantera">cantera</a>". In 1995, Athletic had signed <a href="Joseba%20Etxeberria">Joseba Etxeberria</a> from regional rivals Real Sociedad, causing considerable bad feeling between the two clubs. Etxeberria was a prominent member of the 1997–98 squad, along with <a href="Rafael%20Alkorta">Rafael Alkorta</a>, <a href="Ismael%20Urzaiz">Ismael Urzaiz</a> and <a href="Julen%20Guerrero">Julen Guerrero</a>.
21st century.
The club narrowly avoided relegation during the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20La%20Liga">2005–06</a> and <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">2006–07</a> seasons, the latter being the worst in the club's history. In the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, they reached their first final in 24 years, <a href="2009%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">losing 4–1 to Barcelona</a>.
Prior to the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Athletic%20Bilbao%20season">2011–12 season</a>, Athletic's new president, former player <a href="Josu%20Urrutia">Josu Urrutia</a>, brought in coach <a href="Marcelo%20Bielsa">Marcelo Bielsa</a>; Athletic advanced to their first European final since 1977, losing 3–0 to Spanish rivals Atlético Madrid on 9 May in the <a href="2012%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">2012 UEFA Europa League Final</a> at the <a href="Arena%20Na%C8%9Bional%C4%83">Arena Națională</a> in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>. They also reached the <a href="2012%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2012 Copa del Rey Final</a>, losing again to Barcelona.
After star midfielder <a href="Javi%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Javi Martínez</a> moved to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">FC Bayern Munich</a>, Athletic were eliminated from the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%23Group%20I">2012–13 Europa League group stage</a>, and were knocked out of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> by Basque club <a href="SD%20Eibar">Eibar</a> of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">third tier</a>. Relegation was a threat until the end of the season, and the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20La%20Liga">final league game</a> at the "old" San Mamés ended in defeat. Athletic would soon move to a new stadium, albeit in a partially completed state. Bielsa promoted young defender <a href="Aymeric%20Laporte">Aymeric Laporte</a> into the side, while striker <a href="Fernando%20Llorente">Fernando Llorente</a> completed a <a href="free%20transfer%20%28association%20football%29">free transfer</a> to <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>.
After Bielsa, <a href="Ernesto%20Valverde">Ernesto Valverde</a> returned for a second spell as manager, and he signed or brought through several new players as Athletic came fourth in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">the league</a>, meaning a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> campaign. <a href="Ander%20Herrera">Ander Herrera</a> transferred to Manchester United for €36 million deal at the end of the season.
Athletic had a triumphant first full-capacity match in the new <a href="San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%282013%29">San Mamés</a> as they defeated <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a> to qualify for the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> group stage, however they could only finish 3rd in the group. Athletic reached the <a href="2015%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2015 Copa del Rey Final</a>, but once again lost to Barcelona, 3–1.
In the first leg of the <a href="2015%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">2015 Supercopa de España</a> at San Mamés, Athletic defeated Barcelona 4–0, with <a href="Aritz%20Aduriz">Aritz Aduriz</a> scoring a hat-trick. In the return leg at <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a>, Athletic hung on with a 1–1 draw to win their first trophy since 1984. Aduriz finished with 36 goals in all competitions. Athletic advanced to the quarter-finals in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> where they were only defeated on penalties by the holders and eventual repeat winners <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla FC</a>.
Valverde left his position at the end of the 2016–17 season after four years. It was confirmed that his successor would be former player <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20%C3%81ngel%20Ziganda">José Ángel Ziganda</a>, moving up from Bilbao Athletic. On 29 November the club suffered a shock defeat to <a href="SD%20Formentera">SD Formentera</a> in the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Copa%20del%20Rey%23Round%20of%2032">domestic cup</a>. At the conclusion of a poor season overall, Ziganda was dismissed and <a href="Eduardo%20Berizzo">Eduardo Berizzo</a> was appointed. However, his spell was even less fruitful and in December 2018, having won just two of his fifteen matches at the helm and with the team in <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20La%20Liga">the relegation zone</a>, Berizzo was dismissed. B-team coach <a href="Gaizka%20Garitano">Gaizka Garitano</a> took over and oversaw an improvement in results, with the club moving well out of danger and narrowly missing out on a Europa League spot on the last day.
The beginning of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20La%20Liga">2019–20</a> season saw more consistent results. After the first five games of the season, the "Lions" sat at the top of the table, their best start in 26 years. That form could not be maintained, and by the halfway point they had slipped to mid-table after several draws. However, in the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, they survived two penalty shootouts against second-tier opponents and then defeated Barcelona to reach the semi-finals. The club then defeated <a href="Granada%20CF">Granada CF</a> in the semi-final on away goals to meet local rivals Real Sociedad in the final – which was then postponed due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Spain">COVID-19 pandemic in Spain</a>, both clubs happy to delay in the hope of supporters being able to attend the historic Basque derby occasion. This did not come to pass, and <a href="2020%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">the final</a> was eventually played in an empty stadium on 3 April 2021, Real Sociedad emerging winners by a 1–0 scoreline. By that time, Aduriz had finally retired from playing, Garitano had been replaced as coach by <a href="Marcelino%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Toral">Marcelino</a>, and the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">2020–21 Supercopa de España</a> originally intended to follow the delayed cup final was contested, Athletic defeating Real Madrid then Barcelona to claim the trophy. They also defeated Levante in the semi-final of the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2020–21 Copa del Rey</a> to reach the final on 17 April 2021, making them the only team to take part in the showpiece event twice in as many weeks; however, Athletic lost <a href="2021%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">that final</a> as well, to Barcelona by a 4–0 scoreline. In October 2021, a report from the <a href="International%20Centre%20for%20Sports%20Studies">International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES)</a> showed that Athletic Bilbao and <a href="FC%20Desna%20Chernihiv">Desna Chernihiv</a> (Ukraine) were the only teams in European continental competitions without foreign players.
Crest.
Athletic's shield has incorporated the escutcheons of Bilbao and Biscay. From the shield of Bilbao, it takes <a href="San%20Ant%C3%B3n%20Bridge">the bridge</a> and the <a href="Church%20of%20Saint%20Anthony%20the%20Great">church of San Anton</a>, and the wolves from the powerful <a href="House%20of%20Haro">Haro family</a>, who were lords of Biscay and founders of Bilbao in 1300. From the shield of Biscay, it takes the <a href="Gernikako%20Arbola">Gernikako Arbola</a> (Guernica's tree) and the <a href="Cross%20of%20Burgundy">cross of Saint Andrew</a> (<a href="saltire">saltire</a>s). Its first documented use dates from 1922.
The first official club crest was a blue circle surrounded by a belt with the letters A and C in the centre in white (as the club colours were at that point). The second was from 1910, consisting of a red-and-white flag (newly adopted as the shirt colours) with a red square in the top left corner, containing the initials of the club in white. The third, from 1913, involved the same flag, but in this case shown on a pole wrapped around a football (this is very similar to the <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a> crest still in use today, ignoring the crown of royal patronage).
The first version of the current crest, roughly an inverted triangular shield shape with a section of red-and-white stripes and a section of local motifs, is from 1922; this was a really simple version which was adapted several times, some of which closely resembled the crest of <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, originally a branch of the Bilbao club. Finally, in 1941 the first version of the current shield was created, but the name "Atlético Bilbao" was used when <a href="General%20Francisco%20Franco">General Francisco Franco</a> outlawed all non-Spanish names during his fascist reign. In 1972, the club added full colour to the design and recovered the original English "Athletic Club" name. In 2008, the shape of the shield was slightly altered and a new "Athletic Club" typeface was introduced.
Presidency.
The current club president (elected in June 2022, following <a href="Aitor%20Elizegi">Aitor Elizegi</a>) is Jon Uriarte.
The board of the Athletic Club is composed of the following directors:
Club colours.
Athletic began playing in an improvised white kit, but in the 1902–03 season, the club's first official strip became half-blue, half-white shirts similar to those worn by <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, which were donated by Juan Moser. Later, a young student from Bilbao named Juan Elorduy, who was spending Christmas 1909 in <a href="London">London</a>, was charged by the club to buy 25 new shirts, but was unable to find enough. Waiting for the ship back to Bilbao and empty handed, Elorduy realised that the colours of the local team <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> matched the colours of the City of Bilbao, and bought 50 shirts to take with him. Upon arriving in Bilbao, the club's directors decided almost immediately to change the team's strip to the new colours, and since 1910, Athletic Club have played in red and white stripes. Of the 50 shirts bought by Elorduy, half were then sent to <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, where Elorduy was a committee member and a former player; it had originally begun as a youth branch of Athletic Bilbao. An investigation in 2023 proposed an alternative kit origin location as <a href="Sunderland">Sunderland</a>. Before the switch, only one other team in Spain wore red and white: <a href="Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n">Sporting de Gijón</a>, since 1905. Change colours have often been blue and/or white, or black. In 2011, Athletic released a green, white and red away kit inspired by the <a href="Ikurri%C3%B1a">Basque flag</a> (this was worn against Atlético Madrid in the <a href="2012%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20final">2012 UEFA Europa League final</a>).
Between 2001 and 2009 Athletic also manufactured their own playing kit, under the brand "100% Athletic" and utilising the small design from their centenary celebrations as a manufacturer's logo.
Athletic were one of the last major clubs which did not have the logo of an official sponsor emblazoned on their kit. In the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> and the Copa del Rey of 2004–05, the shirt sported the word "<a href="Euskadi">Euskadi</a>" in green with sponsorship from the <a href="Basque%20Government">Basque Government</a>. This policy was changed in 2008, when Athletic made a deal with the <a href="Biscay">Biscay</a>-based <a href="Petronor">Petronor</a> oil company to wear their logo in exchange for over €2 million. The <a href="Kutxabank">Kutxabank</a> logo now adorns the front of Athletic's kits.

The <a href="Lezama%20Facilities">Lezama Facilities</a> is the complex where all of the categories of Athletic train. It was opened in the 1971–72 season, under the presidency of Felix Oráa. At present, facilities include, "inter alia", five natural grass fields, a gymnasium, a pediment, a medical center and a residence for young players. Lezama has undergone remodeling since 1995 under the presidency of José María Arrate with the construction of new roads and parking entry and exit able to absorb the large number of vehicles that come every day, and a platform cover bringing greater convenience to fans attending the matches of the youth teams and other youth football teams.
These facilities are located in the municipality of <a href="Lezama">Lezama</a>, approximately ten miles from <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a>.
Future.
The Board has given the green light to the so-called "Lezama Master Plan", which was founded with the purpose of modernizing the structures of both the youth teams and first team. The "Plan" is the result of a rigorous study of the basic needs for the future of the Athletic Club. The work will take place over the course of two to three years and its budget is around €12 million. The club is committed to consolidate its cantera structure, which is the basis for the future of the club and in this regard Lezama will be expanded to classrooms for youth work in the lower categories and create an audiovisual department.

Club Deportivo Numancia de Soria, S.A.D. is a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football club</a> in <a href="Soria">Soria</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Castile%20and%20Le%C3%B3n">Castile and León</a>. Founded on 9 April 1945, it plays in , holding home games at "<a href="Nuevo%20Estadio%20Los%20Pajaritos">Nuevo Estadio Los Pajaritos</a>".
Besides <a href="Association%20football">football</a> it had other <a href="Sports%20club">departments in sports</a>, such as volleyball, women's <a href="handball">handball</a>, and <a href="rhythmic%20gymnastics">rhythmic gymnastics</a>.
History.
The club was founded on 9 April 1945. Numancia was named after the ancient <a href="Celtiberians">Celtiberian</a> town of <a href="Numantia">Numantia</a>, near where <a href="Soria">Soria</a> would be later founded. Having spent a long time in the "<a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>", the club made consistent progress, reaching the <a href="La%20Liga">first division</a> on three occasions: 1999, 2004 and 2008.
The club became first widely known in Spain in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">1995–96</a>, while still playing at the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">third level</a>, for its <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Copa%20del%20Rey">extraordinary run</a> in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Spanish Cup</a>, eliminating three top flight clubs (<a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Racing de Santander</a> and <a href="Sporting%20de%20Gij%C3%B3n">Sporting de Gijón</a>) and only being knocked out in the quarter-finals by <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, after Numancia drew in the first leg and took the lead in the second.
Numancia's most important milestone came in 1999, when the team managed to promote to La Liga for the first time. In the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Segunda%20Division">1998–99 season</a>, Numancia finished third in Segunda, only behind <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20CF">Málaga CF</a> and <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20B">Atlético Madrid B</a>, meaning the promotion to the top tier. Their first ever season in the Spanish elite proved to be challenging. Numancia eventually finished 17th, thus avoiding an immediate relegation to Segunda. Their survival was made possible because of unexpectedly good home results. Numancia won 9 home games, drew 6, and lost only 4 games at home. Their second season in the elite was less successful, as the team finished in last place. Numancia again displayed strong results at home, winning eight of their ten wins at home. However, that was eventually not enough to avoid a drop to Segunda, after a two-year spell in La Liga.
Numancia spent three seasons in Segunda Division, before promotion again after the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Segunda%20Division">2003–04 season</a>, as the club finished third. Numancia'second spell in the Spanish top tier was not successful as it only won 6 games. This meant that relegation followed just one season after.
Following another three years in Segunda, Numancia came back to La Liga for season <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">2008–09</a>. Following a 1–3 loss at Sporting de Gijón on 2 November 2008, Numancia had conceded a total of 200 goals in the top division in slightly more than three seasons, reaching 44th in the <a href="La%20Liga%23All-time%20La%20Liga%20table">all-time</a> list. It battled bravely against relegation, but eventually <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">returned to level two after just one year</a>, as second from bottom, even though the season had started on a high note with a 1–0 home win against eventual champions Barcelona.
Numancia was relegated to third division followed at the end of the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2019-20 season</a> after 23 years playing between first and second division. On next season, due to restructuring of the <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football league system</a>, Numancia failed to survive in the third-tier and finding themselves dropped in the fourth-tier, in the newly formed <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">Segunda División RFEF</a>, for the 2021–22 season. On next season, Numancia achieved promoted back to newly third division, <a href="Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20RFEF">Primera División RFEF</a>.

Real Betis

Real Betis Balompié, known as Real Betis () or just Betis, is a Spanish professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Seville">Seville</a> in the <a href="Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">autonomous community</a> of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. Founded in 1907, it plays in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>. It holds home games at the <a href="Estadio%20Benito%20Villamar%C3%ADn">Estadio Benito Villamarín</a> in the south of the city with a 60,720-seat capacity.
Real Betis won the league title in <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20La%20Liga">1935</a> and the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1977</a>, <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2005</a> and <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2022</a>. Given the club's tumultuous history and many relegations, its motto is "¡Viva el Betis manque (aunque) pierda!" ("Long live Betis even though they lose!").
History.
The name "Betis" is derived from "<a href="Hispania%20Baetica">Baetis</a>", the Roman name for the <a href="Guadalquivir">Guadalquivir</a> river which passes through Seville and which the Roman province there was named after. "Real" ('Royal') was added in 1914 after the club received patronage from King <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XIII</a>.
Foundation.
Betis' city rivals <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla FC</a> were the first club in Sevilla, founded in October 1905, while a second club, "España Balompié" were established in September 1907. "Balompié" translates literally as "football", as opposed to the most commonly adopted anglicised version, "fútbol". Balompié was founded by students from the local Polytechnic Academy, and were in operation for one year before being officially recognised (in 1909) as "Sevilla Balompié"; despite this, 1907 remains the official foundation date of the club.
Following an internal split from Sevilla FC, another club was formed, Betis Football Club. In 1914, they merged with Sevilla Balompié. The club received its royal patronage in the same year, and therefore adopted the name Real Betis Balompié. Fans continued to refer to the club as "Balompié" and were themselves known as "Los Balompedistas" until the 1930s, when "Betis" and the adjective "Béticos" became common terminology when discussing the club and its followers.
Real Betis originally played in all blue jerseys and white shorts, for no other reason than the easy availability of such plain colours. But one of the founders and captain, Manuel Ramos Asensio, was keen to take advantage of his relationships made while studying in Scotland, contacted <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> (whose green and white colours matched the Andalusian regional flag) and obtained the same fabric to make kits for his own club. Ramos had the lines re-orientated from horizontal 'hoops' into vertical stripes to make the shirts (no other Spanish club used the combination at the time). There is no mention of Celtic or Scotland in the history of Betis on the club's official website, but in 2017 the club officially acknowledged the link by producing a special hooped kit to coincide with <a href="Andalusia%20Day">Andalusia Day</a>. The blue colour is still often used in away kit designs.
1930s: promotion, championship and relegation.
During the <a href="Spanish%20Second%20Republic">Spanish Second Republic</a> (1931–1939), royal patronage of all organisations was nullified, and thus the club was known as Betis Balompié until after the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> when it would revert to the full name. The club reached the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Presidente de la República</a> final for the first time on 21 June 1931, when it lost 3–1 to <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> in Madrid. Betis marked their 25th anniversary year by winning their first <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> title in <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1932</a>, finishing two points ahead of <a href="Real%20Oviedo">Oviedo FC</a>, thus becoming the first club from <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> to play in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>.
Under the guidance of Irish coach <a href="Patrick%20O%27Connell%20%28footballer%29">Patrick O'Connell</a> on 28 April 1935 <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20La%20Liga">Betis won La Liga</a>, to date their only top division title. They topped the table by a single point over <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Madrid FC</a>. A year later Betis went down to <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20La%20Liga">seventh</a>. This was due to the dismantling of the championship-winning team because of the club's poor economic situation and the arrival of the Civil War, meaning that just 15 months after winning the league title only two players who won in 1935 were left: Peral and Saro. No official league was held during the Civil War between 1936 and 1939, until its resumption for the 1939–40 season and the first year back highlighted Betis' decline as exactly five years after winning the title the club was <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20La%20Liga">relegated</a>.
Darkest period.
Despite a brief <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20La%20Liga">return to the top division</a> which lasted only one season, the club continued to decline and in 1947 the worst fears were reached when they were relegated to <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>. Many fans see the ten years they spent in the category as key to the "identity" and "soul" of the club. During this time, Betis earned a reputation for filling its stadium and having a massive support at away matches, known as the "Green March".
When the side returned to the second level in 1954, it gained the distinction of being the only club in Spain to have won all three major divisions' titles. Much of the credit for guiding Betis through this dark period and back into the "Segunda" lies with chairman Manuel Ruiz Rodríguez.
Benito Villamarín.
In 1955, Manuel Ruiz Rodríguez stepped down from running the club believing he could not offer further economic growth, he was replaced by Betis most famous former president, Benito Villamarín. During his reign Betis returned to the top division in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20La%20Liga">1958–59</a> and finished in third place in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20La%20Liga">1964</a>. His purchase of the <a href="Estadio%20Benito%20Villamar%C3%ADn">Estadio Heliópolis</a> in 1961 is seen as a key point in the history of the club – the grounds were called the "Estadio Benito Villamarín" until 1997. In 1965, Villamarín stepped down from his position after ten years at the helm of the club.
Just one year after Villamarín's departure, the club would again be relegated to division two, then rising and falling almost consecutively until consolidating their place in the top level in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20La%20Liga">1974–75</a>.
First Copa del Rey Title and European Qualification.
On 25 June 1977, Betis played Athletic Bilbao at the <a href="Vicente%20Calder%C3%B3n%20Stadium">Vicente Calderón Stadium</a> in the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Copa%20del%20Rey%23Final">Copa del Rey final</a>. The match finished 2–2, with Betis winning 8–7 after a staggering 21 <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a> taken. This rounded off a solid season in which the club <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20La%20Liga">finished fifth in the league</a>.
After that triumph, Betis <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">competed</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>: after knocking out <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> 3–2 on aggregate in the first round, the side reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Moscow">Dynamo Moscow</a>. Despite their strong performance in <a href="UEFA">Europe</a>, the team <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20La%20Liga">suffered league relegation</a>.
The following year, Betis returned to the top flight and ushered in a period of "good times" for the club, with the next three seasons seeing three top-six finishes, as well as <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> qualification in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20La%20Liga">1982</a> and <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20La%20Liga">1984</a>.
During the summer of 1982, the Benito Villamarín hosted two matches as part of the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 FIFA World Cup</a>, and also witnessed the <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain national team</a>'s famous <a href="Spain%20vs%20Malta%201984%20UEFA%20European%20Football%20Championship%20qualifying%20match">12–1 hammering</a> of <a href="Malta%20national%20football%20team">Malta</a> to <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201984%20qualifying">qualify</a> for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201984">UEFA Euro 1984</a>.
Economic crisis and Manuel Ruiz de Lopera.
In 1992, Betis found itself subject to new league rules and regulations due to its restructuring as an autonomous sporting group (SAD), requiring the club to come up with 1,200 million <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a>, roughly double that of all the first and second division teams, despite being in level two at the time.
In just three months, the fans raised 400 million pesetas with then vice-president <a href="Manuel%20Ruiz%20de%20Lopera">Manuel Ruiz de Lopera</a> stepping in to provide an economic guarantee while himself becoming majority shareholder as the team narrowly avoided relegation.
On 11 September 1994, Real Betis played its 1,000th game in La Liga.
Serra Ferrer success.
After another three seasons in the second division, with the club managed by <a href="Lorenzo%20Serra%20Ferrer">Lorenzo Serra Ferrer</a>, Betis <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">returned to the top flight</a> for the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20La%20Liga">1994–95 season</a>, subsequently achieving a final third position, thus <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20UEFA%20Cup">qualifying to the UEFA Cup</a>.In the European campaign, Betis knocked out <a href="Fenerbah%C3%A7e%20S.K.%20%28football%29">Fenerbahçe</a> (4–1 on aggregate) and <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">1. FC Kaiserslautern</a> (4–1) before losing to <a href="1996%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">defeated finalists</a> <a href="FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> (3–2). In 1997, 20 years after winning the trophy for the first time, the club returned to the final of the Copa del Rey – again held in Madrid, although this time at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> – <a href="1997%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">losing 2–3</a> against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a>.
Incidentally, "Barça" was the club Serra Ferrer would leave Betis for that summer, to be replaced by former player <a href="Luis%20Aragon%C3%A9s">Luis Aragonés</a>. Aragonés would only last <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20La%20Liga">one season</a> with the club, leading the side to the eighth position and to <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">the quarter-finals in the Cup Winners' Cup</a>, where they would lose 2–5 on aggregate to eventual winners <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>.
Aragonés was followed by the controversial reign of <a href="Javier%20Clemente">Javier Clemente</a>, who spat on a fan and implied Andalusia was "another country!". The team slipped down the table, <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20La%20Liga">finishing 11th</a> and <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Cup">being knocked out of the UEFA Cup</a> by <a href="Bologna%20F.C.%201909">Bologna</a> in the third round. For the next couple of seasons, Betis went through numerous managers, a relegation and a promotion, after which the team <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20La%20Liga">finished sixth in the league</a> with <a href="Juande%20Ramos">Juande Ramos</a> at the helm.
Ramos was gone after just one season, however, being replaced by former Cup Winners' Cup-winning manager <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Víctor Fernández</a>. He led the team to <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20La%20Liga">eighth</a> and <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20La%20Liga">ninth</a> in the league and the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Cup">third round of the 2002–03 UEFA Cup</a>, being knocked out by <a href="AJ%20Auxerre">Auxerre</a> (1–2 on aggregate), during his two-year reign.
For 2004, Fernández was replaced by the returning Serra Ferrer, who guided the team to the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20La%20Liga">fourth position in the top flight</a>. They also returned to the Vicente Calderón on 11 June 2005 for the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey final</a>, lifting the trophy for only the second time after an extra-time winner by youth graduate <a href="Dani%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29">Dani</a> in a <a href="2005%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2–1 win</a> against <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a>.
The league finish meant Betis became the first Andalusian team to compete in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, and it reached <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">the group stage</a> after disposing of <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a> in the last qualifying round (3–2 on aggregate). Drawn in Group G, and in spite of a 1–0 home win against Chelsea, the club eventually finished third, being "demoted" to the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, where it would be ousted in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup%20knockout%20stage">round of 16</a> by Romanian club <a href="FC%20Steaua%20Bucure%C8%99ti">Steaua București</a> with a 0–3 home loss. Compared to the previous season, the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20La%20Liga">league campaign</a> was disappointing, with the club finishing in 14th place, just three points off the relegation zone.
Centenary celebrations.
Betis celebrated their <a href="Century">centenary</a> year in 2007. The festivities included a special match against Milan, the <a href="2007%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">reigning European Champions</a>, on August 9, with the hosts winning 1–0 thanks to a <a href="Mark%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Mark González</a> <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a> early in the second half. Seven days later, the club won the <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20de%20Carranza%20Trophy">Ramón de Carranza Trophy</a> held in neighbouring <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, beating <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a> on penalties in the final, having defeated Real Madrid in the semi-finals.
Surrounding the celebration, it was a time of great change in terms of the playing and technical teams, with eight new signings replacing 14 departures. In the summer of 2006, Serra Ferrer was replaced by <a href="Luis%20Fernandez">Luis Fernandez</a> for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">2006–07</a> season. However, the two seasons that encompassed the centenary year (2006–07 and <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Real%20Betis%20season">2007–08</a>) were disappointing, with the club having four different managers and barely avoiding relegation in both seasons.
Relegation.
After many years of staving off relegation, Betis' <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Real%20Betis%20season">2008–09 season</a> culminated with a 1–1 draw against <a href="Real%20Valladolid">Real Valladolid</a> at home. As a result, the club finished 18th in the table and consequently was relegated to the second division on goal difference.
On 15 June 2009 over 65,000 "Beticos", including icons such as <a href="Rafael%20Gordillo">Rafael Gordillo</a>, Del Sol, <a href="Hip%C3%B3lito%20Rinc%C3%B3n">Hipólito Rincón</a>, <a href="Julio%20Carde%C3%B1osa">Julio Cardeñosa</a> and others, joined the protest march in Sevilla with the slogan "15-J Yo Voy Betis" to let the majority owner Ruiz de Lopera know that it was time to put his 54% share of the club on the market for someone, some entity or the Betis supporters to buy those shares and remove Lopera from the day-to-day operations of the club.
Despite the protests, no upper management changes were made during <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the season</a>, which would ultimately see Betis fail to gain promotion back to the top level.
Lopera court action and sale.
Seville judge Mercedes Alaya was investigating links between Betis and other Ruiz de Lopera-owned businesses, leading to him being formally charged with fraud. On 7 July 2010, one week before the start of preliminary court proceedings, Lopera sold 94% of the shares that he owned (51% of Betis total shares) to Bitton Sport, fronted by Luis Oliver, for the surprisingly low figure of €16 million, leaving Lopera with only minor shares; Oliver had already reportedly taken two football clubs, <a href="Cartagena%20FC">Cartagena</a> and <a href="Xerez%20CD">Xerez</a>, to the brink of bankruptcy.
Before the sale could be officially sanctioned, however, Ayala froze Lopera shareholdings. Left with nothing, despite putting down a €1 million deposit, Oliver hastily bought a nominal number of shares from a third party and was voted onto the board of directors by the existing members (all former cohorts of Lopera), allowing him to carry on running the club. In response to this, the judge appointed well-respected former Betis, Real Madrid and Spain national team legend <a href="Rafael%20Gordillo">Rafael Gordillo</a> to administer Lopera's shares to ensure Lopera was not still running the club and that decisions made were for the benefit of the club not individual board members.
La Liga return.
Again under <a href="Pepe%20Mel">Pepe Mel</a>, Betis started <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20La%20Liga">2011–12</a> with four wins in as many games, with <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Castro">Rubén Castro</a> retaining his goal scoring form from <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">the previous season</a>, where he scored 27 goals. Betis finished 13th in their first season since returning to La Liga.
In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20La%20Liga">2012–13 season</a>, Betis finished seventh in La Liga and qualified for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2013–14 UEFA Europa League</a>, the first European qualification for the club since the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2005–06 Champions League</a>. This European campaign ended in the quarter-finals after losing on penalties to local rivals Sevilla. Betis were relegated from La Liga with three games still to play in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">2013–14 season</a>, but <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">returned immediately as champions</a> with two games to spare.
Back into UEFA competitions.
In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Real%20Betis%20season">2017–18 season</a>, under <a href="Quique%20Seti%C3%A9n">Quique Setién</a>, Betis finished sixth in La Liga and earned a spot in the Europa League. The 2018–19 campaign was very positive; the club reached the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey semi-finals</a> and topped their group in the Europa League, before eventually being knocked out by <a href="Stade%20Rennais%20F.C.">Stade Rennais</a> in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20knockout%20phase">round of 32</a>.
On 23 April 2022 Betis won the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> final against <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> after drawing 1-1 after 120 minutes and winning 5-4 on penalties. It was the first trophy after 17 years, since they won their second <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey on 2005</a> against <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a> (2-1).
Seville derby.
Betis have a long-standing rivalry with city neighbours <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla FC</a>. The two have met 114 times in official competition, with Sevilla holding a 45% win ratio over Betis (31%).
The first match between the two clubs took place on 8 February 1915, with Sevilla winning 4–3. The match was not completed, as high tensions led an aggressive crowd to invade the pitch, forcing the <a href="Referee%20%28association%20football%29">referee</a> to abandon the match.
In 1916, the first "Copa Andalucía" was held, this being the first official derby of the Sevilla area. Of the 17 runnings of the cup, Sevilla were victorious 14 times, to Betis' one sole conquest; this included a 22–0 routing after the latter sent their youth team, in 1918.
The first time the teams met in league, in "Segunda", happened in 1928–29, with both teams winning their home matches (3–0 and 2–1). They played for the first time in the Spanish top division during the 1934–35 season, with a 0–3 home defeat for Sevilla and a 2–2 draw at Betis, with the latter winning the national championship.
On 17 January 1943, Betis lost 5–0 at Sevilla, eventually being relegated. In the first game held at the <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Pizju%C3%A1n%20Stadium">Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium</a>, on 21 September 1958, the "Verdiblancos" won it 4–2.
In later years, several matches were also marred by violence, including: a security guard attacked by a Sevilla fan with a crutch (that he did not require to walk), Betis <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> <a href="Antonio%20Prats%20Cervera">Toni Prats</a> being attacked and Sevilla manager Juande Ramos being struck by a bottle of water; the latter incident led to the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2007 Copa del Rey match</a> being suspended, being played out three weeks later in <a href="Getafe">Getafe</a> with no spectators.
On 7 February 2009 Betis won 2–1 at the Pizjuán, but was eventually relegated from the top flight, while Sevilla finished in third position.
On 9 November 2019 more than 10,000 Betis fans visited the team training before the last derby in 2019.

Stadium.
Upon Real Betis' formation, the club played at the Campo del Huerto de Mariana. In 1909, Betis moved to the Campo del Prado de Santa Justa, moving to the Campo del Prado de San Sebastián, sharing the site with rivals Sevilla two years later. In 1918, Real Betis moved to the <a href="Campo%20del%20Patronato%20Obrero">Campo del Patronato Obrero</a>, with the first game at the ground coming against rivals Sevilla on 1 November 1918, resulting in a 5–1 loss for Real Betis. During the 1920s, the ground was redeveloped numerous times by club president <a href="Ignacio%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Mej%C3%ADas">Ignacio Sánchez Mejías</a>. After the construction of the Estadio de la Exposición, the former name of Betis' current home, in 1929, Real Betis moved into the site officially in 1936, after playing a number of games at the stadium since its construction.
With a 60,720-seat capacity, the <a href="Estadio%20Benito%20Villamar%C3%ADn">Estadio Benito Villamarín</a> is the home ground of Real Betis. It was named "Estadio Manuel Ruiz de Lopera" during the 2000s after the club's owner, who decided to build a new stadium over the old one.
Despite much planning, the stadium's renovation plans were constantly postponed, and half of it remained unchanged. On 27 October 2010, it returned to its first denomination after a decision by the club's associates.
Colours.
Evolution.
In its initial years, Sevilla Balompié dressed in blue shirts with white shorts, which represented the infantry at the time. From late 1911, the team had adopted the shirts of <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>, at that time vertical stripes of green and white, that were brought over from <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> by Manuel Asensio Ramos, who had studied in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> as a child. On 28 February 2017, on the 37th <a href="Andalusia%20Day">Andalusia Day</a>, Real Betis wore Celtic-inspired hoops against <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20CF">Málaga CF</a>.
When the team became Real Betis Balompié in 1914, various kits were used, including: yellow and black stripes; green T-shirts and a reversion to the blue top and white shorts uniform. By the end of the 1920s, Betis was once again sporting green and white stripes, around this time the Assembly of Ronda (1918) saw the Andalusian region formally adopt these colours, not being known how much the two are linked.
Since then, this remained Betis' shirt, despite several versions (including wider stripes).
Together with the basic green-and-white shirt, Betis has wore both black and green shorts in addition to white shorts.

They also qualified for the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2012–13 UEFA Champions League</a>, where they were quarter-finalists. Since June 2010, the owner of the club has been <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a>i investor <a href="Abdullah%20bin%20Nasser%20bin%20Abdullah%20Al%20Ahmed%20Al%20Thani">Abdullah ben Nasser Al Thani</a>.
History.
Club Atlético Malagueño.
Málaga's history trace back to <a href="CD%20M%C3%A1laga">CD Málaga</a>, a club founded in 1904. "Club Atlético Malagueño" was founded on 25 May 1948 as a former <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a> of CD Málaga, after the club absorbed "CD Santo Tomás" with the purpose of establishing a reserve team, took over as Málaga's main team.
"Club Atlético Malagueño" and "CD Málaga" had found themselves together in the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1959–60 Tercera División</a> after "CD Málaga" was relegated at the end of the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1958–59 Segunda División</a>. As a reserve team, the former should have been relegated to regional competition. To avoid this, they separated from their parent club and registered as an independent club within the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">Royal Spanish Football Federation</a>. That move made it possible for CA Malagueño to survive after CD Málaga suspended operations.
The 1992–93 season saw CA Malagueño playing in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División Group 9</a>. After a successful campaign, the club was promoted to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>. The following season, however, the club was relegated again and, facing financial difficulties, were in danger of folding.
Name change to Málaga CF.
On 19 December 1993, in a referendum, the club's members voted in favour of changing names and, on 29 June 1994, CA Malagueño changed their name to Málaga Club de Fútbol S.A.D.
In the early 2000s, Málaga were a club rich in young and top quality players, and boasted a more modern and developed stadium. Although they never pushed for a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> place, Málaga were always successful under the popular <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Peir%C3%B3">Joaquín Peiró</a>.
They made a solitary appearance in the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a> in 2002, clinching their only official trophy by beating <a href="K.A.A.%20Gent">Gent</a>, <a href="Willem%20II%20%28football%20club%29">Willem II</a> and <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a>. Málaga's run in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> was something of an overachievement, and ended in a defeat on penalties in the quarter-finals to <a href="Boavista%20F.C.">Boavista</a>, after beating <a href="FK%20%C5%BDeljezni%C4%8Dar%20Sarajevo">Željezničar Sarajevo</a> (who had been eliminated from the Champions League by <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>), <a href="Amica%20Wronki">Amica Wronki</a>, <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> (after a 2–1 win at Elland Road, courtesy of two <a href="Julio%20Dely%20Vald%C3%A9s">Julio Dely Valdés</a> goals) and <a href="AEK%20Athens%20F.C.">AEK Athens</a>.
After Peiró's retirement, a mass exodus slowly started. <a href="Dar%C3%ADo%20Silva">Darío Silva</a>, <a href="Kiki%20Musampa">Kiki Musampa</a>, Dely Valdés and <a href="Pedro%20Contreras">Pedro Contreras</a> all left the club. <a href="Juande%20Ramos">Juande Ramos</a> took over as coach and oversaw a 5–1 home thrashing of <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, the club's biggest victory against the Catalan giants, with a hat-trick from loanee <a href="Salva%20Ballesta">Salva Ballesta</a>, who would end up missing out on the <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">Pichichi Trophy</a> by just two goals. Ramos, however, left for the <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> and <a href="Gregorio%20Manzano">Gregorio Manzano</a> took charge.
Slow decline and financial issues.
Despite steering Málaga to their second consecutive tenth-placed finish, Manzano could not prevent a lackluster side from being relegated, and they finished at the bottom of the league with a paltry 24 points to their name.
Málaga began the new second division season well. However, their form dipped dramatically and for two of the remaining six weeks were in the relegation zone. Málaga managed to address this situation and survived their first Segunda season.
The <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2007–08 Segunda División</a> also began impressively, with seven straight victories. Málaga seemed to be on track for promotion but, after another slump in form, they were overtaken as leaders by <a href="CD%20Numancia">Numancia</a>. They needed a victory in their final game, at home to <a href="CD%20Tenerife">Tenerife</a>, to assure promotion. Two goals from <a href="Antonio%20Hidalgo%20Morilla">Antonio Hidalgo</a> secured a 2–1 triumph and Málaga returned to the top flight as runners-up.
Abdullah Al Thani era (2010–present).
Due to the club's economic problems, then-president <a href="Fernando%20Sanz">Fernando Sanz</a> found investments at <a href="Doha">Doha</a> in <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a> to launch an ambitious project, entering in conversations with <a href="sheikh">sheikh</a> <a href="Abdullah%20bin%20Nasser%20bin%20Abdullah%20Al%20Ahmed%20Al%20Thani">Abdullah ben Nasser Al Thani</a>. On 11 June 2010, after a week of negotiations, Al Thani became the entity's new owner, being named president on 28 July in the members' meeting.
On 28 June 2010, <a href="Jesualdo%20Ferreira">Jesualdo Ferreira</a> was appointed as coach and <a href="Moayad%20Shatat">Moayad Shatat</a> was appointed as vice president and general manager. Following this was the signing of prominent players like <a href="Salom%C3%B3n%20Rond%C3%B3n">Salomón Rondón</a> and <a href="Eliseu">Eliseu</a>. In November, however, Jesualdo was fired because he had not obtained the desired performance, positioning the club in the relegation places. Later, Shatat confirmed <a href="Manuel%20Pellegrini">Manuel Pellegrini</a> as coach.
With "The Caretaker" in charge, it was decided to discard players of the squad and strengthen with players like centre back <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Demichelis">Martín Demichelis</a> and midfielder <a href="J%C3%BAlio%20Baptista">Júlio Baptista</a>. A record five consecutive <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> wins, alongside a draw against <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> at <a href="San%20Mam%C3%A9s%20Stadium%20%281913%29">San Mamés</a> at the start of January 2011, helped the team maintain momentum in the league, finishing the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20La%20Liga">2010–11 season</a> in 11th place.
In preparation for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20M%C3%A1laga%20CF%20season">2011–12 season</a>, the club signed with <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> as supplier of the club's kits. Málaga also reached a collaboration agreement with <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, which, in addition, became the principal sponsor of the club's kit. The more prominent signings of that season were the Dutchman <a href="Ruud%20van%20Nistelrooy">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a>, the ex-<a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a> French midfielder, <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%A9my%20Toulalan">Jérémy Toulalan</a>, and the most expensive signing in the club's history, <a href="Santi%20Cazorla">Santi Cazorla</a>, who arrived from the <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a> in a <a href="Euro">€</a>21 million deal. Other less prominent players like <a href="Isco">Isco</a>, former <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spanish international</a> midfielder <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201981%29">Joaquín</a> and left back <a href="Nacho%20Monreal">Nacho Monreal</a>, were key in the successful season which followed for the Málaga. For the first time in its history, the club qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> after finishing the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20La%20Liga">2011–12 La Liga</a> campaign in fourth.
In their first ever participation in the Champions League, Málaga were paired with Italian giants <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> and reigning Belgian and Russian champions <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a> and <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">Zenit Saint Petersburg</a>, respectively. Málaga made it out of the group stage unbeaten, winning their matches against all three clubs. In the round of 16, the team drew Portuguese champions <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a>, losing the first away game 1–0 while winning at home 2–0, advancing to the quarter-finals. In a highly anticipated tie against German champions <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>, the home game ended 0–0, leaving "Malagauistas" with a reasonable chance to advance on the back of a draw in the away fixture. In a second leg marked by controversial referee decisions, the scoreboard showed 1–2 at the full 90 minutes mark, seemingly ensuring Málaga's place in the semi-finals, but two late goals by <a href="Marco%20Reus">Marco Reus</a> (90+1st minute) and <a href="Felipe%20Santana">Felipe Santana</a> (90+3rd minute) turned the table in favour of the home team. Immediately after the elimination, club president <a href="Abdullah%20bin%20Nasser%20bin%20Abdullah%20Al%20Ahmed%20Al%20Thani">Abdullah ben Nasser Al Thani</a> announced a formal complaint would be filed with <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> and <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>.
The following season, Málaga was banned by the UEFA, along with other clubs for its debts. In a statement the agency declared that the club would be excluded from a subsequent competition, for which it would otherwise qualify, in the next four seasons. However, the ban was eventually downgraded to one season and the club was excluded from the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2013–14 Europa League</a>.
In the summer of 2013, Isco was sold to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, Joaquín to <a href="ACF%20Fiorentina">Fiorentina</a> and midfielder Jérémy Toulalan to <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a>. The managerial position also changed, with <a href="Bernd%20Schuster">Bernd Schuster</a> taking over from Manuel Pellegrini.
Following 2013, Málaga encountered a steady decline that would result in them finishing in a lower position in the league each year. On 19 April 2018, Málaga faced Levante U.D. hoping to end their run of ten consecutive defeats that left them placed 20th in LaLiga. However, fate took a turn for the worse and Málaga conceded a goal to Levante's <a href="Emmanuel%20Boateng%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201996%29">Emmanuel Boateng</a> in stoppage time to see the final score at 0–1. This loss meant that Málaga would be relegated to the Segunda División, ending a run of ten consecutive seasons in the top flight.
In 2019, Málaga came close to being promoted to La Liga, finishing third in the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, but was eliminated in the first round of the <a href="2019%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20play-offs">play-offs</a> by <a href="Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Deportivo de La Coruña</a>. For the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2019–20 Segunda División</a> season, <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20S%C3%A1nchez%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201976%29">Víctor Sánchez del Amo</a> will continue as coach.
In early 2020, reports emerged that club owner Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani and his family who owe Málaga €7.3m in loans and credit lines, were buying out shares from smaller shareholders to be directed to their personal expenses and business interests, yet up to February 2022 no evidence has proven any misconduct to allow the courts to rule that a criminal case is justified. In August 2020, the court appointed administrator issued a statement that he would lay off the entire first-team squad to save the club from oblivion.
In May 2023, Málaga fell into the third tier for the first time since 1998.
Honours.
Trofeo Costa del Sol.
Between 1961 and 1983, the club organised its own summer tournament, the <a href="Trofeo%20Costa%20del%20Sol">Trofeo Costa del Sol</a>.

History.
Foundation and first years (1903–1939).
The club was founded on 26 April 1903 as "Athletic Club Sucursal de Madrid" by three <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> students living in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>. These founders saw the new club as a youth branch of their childhood team, <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> who they had just seen win the <a href="1903%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1903 Copa del Rey Final</a> in the city. In 1904, they were joined by dissident members of <a href="Real%20Madrid">Real Madrid</a>. The side began playing in blue and white halved shirts, the then colours of Athletic Bilbao, but by 1911, both the Bilbao and Madrid teams were playing in their current colours of red and white stripes. Some believe the change came about because red and white striped tops were the cheapest to make, as the same combination was used to make <a href="ticking">ticking</a> for <a href="mattress">mattress</a>es, and the unused cloth was easily converted into football shirts. This contributed to the club's nickname, "Los Colchoneros".
However, another explanation is that both Athletic Bilbao and Athletic Madrid used to buy <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>' blue and white kits in England. In late 1909, Juanito Elorduy, a former player and member of the board of Athletic Madrid, went to England to buy kits for both teams but failed to find Blackburn kits to purchase; he instead bought the red and white shirts of <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton F.C.</a> (the club from the <a href="Southampton">port city</a> which was his embarkation point back to Spain). An investigation in 2023 proposed an alternative kit origin location as <a href="Sunderland">Sunderland</a>. Athletic Madrid adopted the red and white shirt, leading to them being known as "Los Rojiblancos", but opted to keep their existing blue shorts whereas the Bilbao team switched to new black shorts. Athletic Bilbao won the <a href="1911%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1911 Copa del Rey Final</a> using several 'borrowed' players from Athletic Madrid, including who scored one of their goals.
Athletic's first ground, the Ronda de <a href="Vallecas">Vallecas</a>, was in the eponymous working-class area on the south side of the city. In 1919, the Compañía Urbanizadora Metropolitana—the company that ran the underground communication system in Madrid—acquired some land, near the <a href="University%20City%20of%20Mexico">Ciudad Universitaria</a>. In 1921, Athletic Madrid became independent of parent-club Athletic Bilbao and moved into a 35,800-seater stadium built by the company, the <a href="Estadio%20Metropolitano%20de%20Madrid">Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid</a>.
During the 1920s, Athletic won the "<a href="Campeonato%20Regional%20Centro">Campeonato del Centro</a>" three times and were runners-up in 1921, where they faced parent club Athletic Bilbao, as they would again in 1926. Based on these successes, in 1928 they were invited to join the Primera División of the inaugural <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> played the following year. During their debut La Liga campaign, the club was managed by <a href="Fred%20Pentland">Fred Pentland</a>, but after two seasons they were relegated to <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>. They briefly returned to La Liga in 1934 but were relegated again in 1936 after <a href="Josep%20Samitier">Josep Samitier</a> took over in mid-season from Pentland. The <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> gave "Los Colchoneros" a reprieve, as <a href="Real%20Oviedo">Real Oviedo</a> was unable to play due to the destruction of their stadium during the bombings. Thus, both La Liga and Athletic's relegation were postponed, the latter by winning a playoff against <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a>, champion of the Segunda División tournament.
Athletic Aviación de Madrid (1939–1947).
By 1939, when La Liga had resumed, Athletic had merged with "<a href="Club%20Aviaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional">Aviación Nacional</a>" of <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a> to become "Athletic Aviación de Madrid". Aviación Nacional had been founded in 1937 by three aviation officers of the <a href="Spanish%20Air%20Force">Spanish Air Force</a>. They had been promised a place in the Primera División for the 1939–40 season, only to be denied by the <a href="Royal%20Spanish%20Football%20Federation">RFEF</a>, and since they did not want to go through the whole divisional climb up, this club merged with Athletic, whose squad had lost eight players during the Civil War, including the team's star, <a href="Monch%C3%ADn%20Triana">Monchín Triana</a>, who was shot dead. At that time, <a href="Real%20Oviedo">Real Oviedo</a> also had its field destroyed by the war, so it was decided to give up its place to another team, and that final spot was contested by Aviación and <a href="CA%20Osasuna">CA Osasuna</a>, in a match in <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a> on 26 November 1939, which Aviación won 3–1. With the legendary <a href="Ricardo%20Zamora">Ricardo Zamora</a> as manager, the club subsequently won their first La Liga title that season and retained the title in <a href="1940%E2%80%9341%20La%20Liga">1941</a>. The most influential and charismatic player of these years was the captain <a href="Germ%C3%A1n%20G%C3%B3mez">Germán Gómez</a>, who was signed from <a href="Racing%20de%20Santander">Racing de Santander</a> in 1939. He played eight consecutive seasons for the "Rojiblancos" until the <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20La%20Liga">1947–48 campaign</a>. From his central midfield position, he formed a legendary midfield alongside Machín and <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Gabilondo">Ramón Gabilondo</a>.
In mid-1940, <a href="Language%20politics%20in%20Francoist%20Spain">a decree issued by Francisco Franco</a> banned teams from using foreign names and the club became "Atlético Aviación de Madrid". In September 1940, Atlético Aviación won the very first <a href="Super%20cup">Super cup</a> in Spanish football after beating RCD Español, the <a href="1940%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo">1940 Copa del Generalísimo</a> winners, in a two-legged game that ended in a 10–4 aggregate victory, including a 7–1 trashing in the second leg at <a href="Campo%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20de%20Vallecas">Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas</a>. On 14 December 1946, the club decided to drop the military association from its name, and shortly after, on 6 January, it settled on its current name of "Club Atlético de Madrid". Also in 1947, Atlético beat <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> 5–0 at the "Metropolitano", their biggest win over their cross-town rivals to date.
Golden age (1947–1965).
Under <a href="Helenio%20Herrera">Helenio Herrera</a> and with the help of <a href="Larbi%20Benbarek">Larbi Benbarek</a>, Atlético won La Liga again in <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20La%20Liga">1950</a> and <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20La%20Liga">1951</a>. With the departure of Herrera in 1953, the club began to slip behind Real Madrid and <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and for the remainder of the 1950s were left to battle it out with Athletic Bilbao for the title of third team in Spain.
However, during the 1960s and 1970s, Atlético Madrid seriously challenged Barcelona for the position of second team. The <a href="1957-58%20La%20Liga">1957–58 season</a> saw <a href="Ferdinand%20Dau%C4%8D%C3%ADk">Ferdinand Daučík</a> take charge of Atlético, where he led them to second place in La Liga. This resulted in Atlético qualifying for the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20European%20Cup">1958–59 European Cup</a> since the winners, Real Madrid, were the reigning European champions. Inspired by Brazilian centre-forward <a href="Vav%C3%A1">Vavá</a> and <a href="Enrique%20Collar">Enrique Collar</a>, Atlético reached the semi-finals after beating <a href="Drumcondra%20F.C.">Drumcondra</a>, <a href="PFC%20CSKA%20Sofia">CSKA Sofia</a> and <a href="FC%20Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>. In the semi-finals, they met Real Madrid, who won the first leg 2–1 at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu</a> while Atlético won 1–0 at the "Metropolitano". The tie went to a replay and Real won 2–1 in Zaragoza.
Atlético, however, gained their revenge when, led by former Real coach <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Villalonga%20Llorente">José Villalonga</a>, they defeated Real in two successive Copa del Rey finals in <a href="1960%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1960</a> and <a href="1961%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1961</a>. In 1962, they won the <a href="1961-62%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, beating <a href="ACF%20Fiorentina">Fiorentina</a> 3–0 after a replay. This achievement was significant for the club, as the Cup Winners' Cup was the only major European trophy that Real Madrid never won. The following year the club reached the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1963</a> final, but lost to <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">English</a> side <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 5–1. <a href="Enrique%20Collar">Enrique Collar</a>, who continued to be an influential player during this era, was now joined by the likes of midfielder <a href="Miguel%20Jones">Miguel Jones</a> and midfield playmaker <a href="Adelardo%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Adelardo</a>.
Atlético's best years coincided with dominant Real Madrid teams. Between 1961 and 1980, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning the competition 14 times. During this era, only Atlético offered Real any serious challenge, winning La Liga titles in <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20La%20Liga">1966</a>, <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20La%20Liga">1970</a>, <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20La%20Liga">1973</a> and <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20La%20Liga">1977</a> and finishing runners-up in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20La%20Liga">1961</a>, <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20La%20Liga">1963</a> and <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20La%20Liga">1965</a>. The club had further success winning the Copa del Rey on three occasions in <a href="1965%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1965</a>, <a href="1972%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1972</a> and <a href="1976%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1976</a>. In 1965, when they finished as <a href="1964-65%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> runners-up to Real after an intense battle for the title, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years.
European Cup Finalists (1965–1974).
In 1966 Atlético left the <a href="Estadio%20Metropolitano%20de%20Madrid">Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid</a> (which was demolished and was replaced with university buildings and an office block belonging to the company ENUSA) and moved to a new home in the <a href="Manzanares%20river">Manzanares river</a> waterfront, the <a href="Vicente%20Calder%C3%B3n%20Stadium">Vicente Calderón Stadium</a>, which was inaugurated on 2 October 1966 with a fixture against Valencia.
Significant players from this era included the now-veteran Adelardo and regular goalscorers <a href="Luis%20Aragon%C3%A9s">Luis Aragonés</a>, <a href="Javier%20Irureta">Javier Irureta</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Eulogio%20G%C3%A1rate">José Eulogio Gárate</a>, the latter winning the <a href="The%20Pichichi%20Trophy">"Pichichi"</a> three times in 1969, 1970 and 1971. In the 1970s, Atlético also recruited several <a href="Argentina">Argentine</a> players, signing <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Ayala">Rubén Ayala</a>, <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Oswaldo%20D%C3%ADaz">Panadero Díaz</a> and <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Armando%20Heredia%20Ruarte">Ramón "Cacho" Heredia</a> as well as coach <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20Lorenzo">Juan Carlos Lorenzo</a>. Lorenzo believed in discipline, caution and disrupting the opponents' game, and although controversial, his methods proved successful—after winning La Liga in <a href="1972-73%20La%20Liga">1973</a>, the club reached the <a href="1974%20European%20Cup%20Final">1974 European Cup Final</a>. On the way to the Final, Atlético knocked out <a href="Galatasaray%20S.K.%20%28football%29">Galatasaray</a>, <a href="FC%20Dinamo%20Bucure%C8%99ti">Dinamo București</a>, <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> and <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>. In the away leg of the semi-final against Celtic, Atlético had Ayala, Díaz and substitute Quique all sent off during a hard-fought encounter in what was reported as one of the worst cases of cynical fouling the tournament has seen. Because of this approach, they managed a 0–0 draw, followed by a 2–0 victory in the return leg with goals from Gárate and Adelardo. The final at <a href="Heysel%20Stadium">Heysel Stadium</a>, however, was a loss for Atlético. Against a <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> team that included <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, <a href="Sepp%20Maier">Sepp Maier</a>, <a href="Paul%20Breitner">Paul Breitner</a>, <a href="Uli%20Hoene%C3%9F">Uli Hoeneß</a> and <a href="Gerd%20M%C3%BCller">Gerd Müller</a>, Atlético played above themselves. Despite missing Ayala, Díaz and Quique through suspension, they went ahead in extra-time with only seven minutes left. Aragonés scored with a superb, curling free-kick that looked like the winner, but in the last minute of the game, Bayern defender <a href="Georg%20Schwarzenbeck">Georg Schwarzenbeck</a> equalized with a stunning 25-yarder that left Atlético goalkeeper <a href="Miguel%20Reina">Miguel Reina</a> motionless. In a replay back at Heysel two days later, Bayern won convincingly 4–0, with two goals each from Hoeneß and Müller.
The Aragonés years (1974–1987).
Shortly after the defeat in the <a href="1974%20European%20Cup%20Final">1974 European Cup Final</a>, Atlético appointed their veteran player Luis Aragonés as coach. Aragonés subsequently served as coach on four separate occasions, from 1974 to 1980, from 1982 to 1987, once again from 1991 until 1993 and finally from 2002 to 2003. His first success came quickly as Bayern Munich had refused to participate in the <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> because of fixture congestion, and as European Cup runners-up, Atlético were invited instead. Their opponents were <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Independiente">Independiente</a> of Argentina and, after losing the away leg 1–0, they won the return leg 2–0 with goals from <a href="Javier%20Irureta">Javier Irureta</a> and <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Ayala">Rubén Ayala</a>. Aragonés subsequently led the club to further successes in the Copa del Rey in <a href="1976%20Copa%20del%20General%C3%ADsimo%20Final">1976</a> and La Liga in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20La%20Liga">1977</a>.
During his second spell in charge, Aragonés led the club to a runners-up finish in <a href="1984-85%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> and a winner's medal in the <a href="1985%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey</a>, both in 1985. He received considerable help from <a href="Hugo%20S%C3%A1nchez">Hugo Sánchez</a>, who scored 19 league goals and won the <a href="The%20Pichichi%20Trophy">"Pichichi"</a>. Sánchez also scored twice in the cup final as Atlético beat Athletic Bilbao 2–1. Sánchez, however, only remained at the club for one season before his move across the city to Real Madrid. Despite the loss of Sánchez, Aragonés went on to lead the club to success in the <a href="Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a> in <a href="1985%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">1985</a> and then guided them to the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> final in <a href="1986%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">1986</a>. Atlético, however, lost their third successive European final, this time 3–0 to <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a>.
The Transition years (1987–2005).
In 1987, controversial politician and businessman <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Gil">Jesús Gil</a> became club president, running the club (and committing a fraud of misappropriation by seizing 95% of the shares while failing to effectively pay a single <a href="Spanish%20peseta">Peseta</a> during the Atlético's forced conversion from fan-owned club to <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">Sociedad Anónima Deportiva</a> in 1992) until his resignation in May 2003.
Atlético had not won La Liga for 10 years and were desperate for league success. Right away, Gil spent heavily, bringing in a number of expensive signings, most notably Portuguese winger <a href="Paulo%20Futre">Paulo Futre</a>, who had just won the <a href="1987%20European%20Cup%20Final">European Cup</a> with <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a>. All the spending, however, only brought in two consecutive Copa del Rey trophies in <a href="1991%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1991</a> and <a href="1992%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">1992</a> as the league title proved elusive. The closest Atlético came to the La Liga trophy was the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20La%20Liga">1990–91 season</a> when they finished runners-up by 10 points to <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a>'s <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. In the process, Gil developed a ruthless reputation due to the manner in which he ran the club. In pursuit of league success, he hired and fired a number of high-profile head coaches, including <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Luis%20Menotti">César Luis Menotti</a>, <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a>, <a href="Javier%20Clemente">Javier Clemente</a>, <a href="Tomislav%20Ivi%C4%87">Tomislav Ivić</a>, <a href="Francisco%20Maturana">Francisco Maturana</a>, <a href="Alfio%20Basile">Alfio Basile</a> as well as club legend Luis Aragonés.
Jesús Gil also closed down Atlético's youth academy in 1992, a move that would prove significant due to 15-year-old academy member <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20%28footballer%29">Raúl</a> who, as a result, went across town to later achieve worldwide fame with rivals Real Madrid. The move came as part of the overall Gil-initiated business restructuring of the club; Atlético became a <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">Sociedad Anónima Deportiva</a>, a corporate structure benefiting from a then-recently introduced special legal status under Spanish corporate law, allowing individuals to purchase and trade club shares.
In the <a href="1994-95%20La%20Liga">1994–95 league</a> campaign, Atlético only avoided relegation via a draw on the last day of the season. This prompted another managerial change along with a wholesale squad clearance during the summer 1995 transfer window. Somewhat unexpectedly, in the following 1995–96 season, newly arrived head coach <a href="Radomir%20Anti%C4%87">Radomir Antić</a>, with a squad including holdovers <a href="Antonio%20Mu%C3%B1oz%20G%C3%B3mez">Toni</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Soloz%C3%A1bal">Roberto Solozábal</a>, <a href="Delf%C3%AD%20Geli">Delfí Geli</a>, <a href="Juan%20Vizca%C3%ADno">Juan Vizcaíno</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Caminero">José Luis Caminero</a>, <a href="Diego%20Simeone">Diego Simeone</a> and <a href="Kiko%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201972%29">Kiko</a>, as well as new acquisitions <a href="Milinko%20Panti%C4%87">Milinko Pantić</a>, <a href="Luboslav%20Penev">Luboslav Penev</a>, <a href="Santiago%20Denia">Santi Denia</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Francisco%20Molina">José Francisco Molina</a> finally delivered the much sought-after league title as Atlético won the <a href="1995-96%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a>/<a href="1996%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey</a> double.
The next season, 1996–97, saw the club take part in the <a href="1996-97%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the first time. With expectations and ambitions raised, the most notable summer transfer signings were striker <a href="Juan%20Esn%C3%A1ider">Juan Esnáider</a> from Real Madrid and <a href="Radek%20Bejbl">Radek Bejbl</a>, who was coming off a great showing for <a href="Czech%20Republic%20national%20football%20team">Czech Republic</a> at <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201996">Euro 1996</a>. Playing on two fronts, Atlético fell out of the league title contention early while, in the Champions League, they were eliminated by <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> in extra-time in the quarter-finals. Before the 1997–98 season, the heavy spending continued with the signings of <a href="Christian%20Vieri">Christian Vieri</a> and <a href="Juninho%20Paulista">Juninho</a>. All of the success, however, produced little change in the overall Gil strategy, and although Antić survived three consecutive seasons in charge, he was replaced during the summer of 1998 with <a href="Arrigo%20Sacchi">Arrigo Sacchi</a>, who himself only remained in the managerial hot seat for less than six months. Antić then returned briefly in early 1999 only to be replaced with <a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a> at the end of the season. The <a href="1999-2000%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20season">1999–2000 season</a> proved disastrous for Atlético. In December 1999, Gil and his board were suspended pending an investigation into the misuse of club funds, with government-appointed administrator José Manuel Rubí running Atlético's day-to-day operations. With the removal of club President Jesús Gil and his board, the players performed poorly and the club floundered. Ranieri handed in his resignation with the club sitting 17th out of 20 in the league table and heading towards relegation. Antić, returning for his third coaching stint, was unable to prevent the inevitable. Despite reaching the <a href="2000%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey</a> final in 2000, Atlético were relegated second time after 66 years.
Atlético spent two seasons in the Segunda División, narrowly missing out on promotion in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20season">2000–01 season</a> before winning the Segunda División championship in 2002. It was again Luis Aragonés, in his fourth and last spell as manager of Atlético, who brought them back to the Primera División. He also coached the team during the next season, and gave <a href="Fernando%20Torres">Fernando Torres</a> his La Liga debut.
Aguirre era (2006–2009).
In 2006, Atlético signed <a href="Portugal%20national%20football%20team">Portuguese</a> midfielders <a href="Costinha">Costinha</a> and <a href="Maniche">Maniche</a>, as well as <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentine</a> forward <a href="Sergio%20Ag%C3%BCero">Sergio Agüero</a>. In July 2007, Fernando Torres left the club for <a href="Liverpool%20F.C">Liverpool</a> for €38 million, while <a href="Luis%20Garc%C3%ADa%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201978%29">Luis García</a> signed for the club at the same time in an unrelated transfer. The club also bought <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a> international and former <a href="European%20Golden%20Boot">European Golden Boot</a> and <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">"Pichichi"</a> winner <a href="Diego%20Forl%C3%A1n">Diego Forlán</a> for roughly €21 million from <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a>. Other additions included Portuguese winger <a href="Sim%C3%A3o%20Sabrosa">Simão Sabrosa</a> from <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> for €20 million and winger <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Reyes">José Antonio Reyes</a> from <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> for €12 million.
In July 2007, the Atlético board reached an agreement with the <a href="Madrid">City of Madrid</a> to sell the land where their stadium was located and move the club to the City-owned <a href="Estadio%20La%20Peineta">Olympic Stadium</a>. The stadium changed hands in 2016 and was bought by the club for €30.4 million. Madrid had applied to host the <a href="2016%20Olympic%20Games">2016 Olympic Games</a>, losing out to <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>.
The <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20season">2007–08 season</a> proved to be the most successful season for the club in the past decade. The team reached the round of 32 in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, where they were defeated by <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. They also reached the quarter-final round of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, where they were beaten by eventual champions <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>. More significantly, the team finished the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">league season</a> in fourth place, qualifying for the <a href="2008-09%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the first time since the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1996–97 season</a>.
On 3 February 2009, <a href="Javier%20Aguirre">Javier Aguirre</a> was dismissed from his post as manager after a poor start to the season, going without a win in six games. He later claimed that this was not accurate, and that he had left by mutual termination rather than through sacking. There was public outrage after his dismissal, many believing he was not the cause of Atlético's problems, namely player Diego Forlán. He backed his former manager and said that, "Dismissing Javier was the easy way out, but he was not the cause of our problems. The players are to blame because we have not been playing well and we have been committing a lot of errors." This led to the appointment of <a href="Abel%20Resino">Abel Resino</a> as Atlético's new manager.
Atlético's success continued in the latter half of the season when they placed fourth once again in the league table, securing a position in the playoff round of the UEFA Champions League. Striker Diego Forlán was crowned with the <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">"Pichichi"</a> and also won the <a href="European%20Golden%20Shoe">European Golden Shoe</a> after scoring 32 goals for Atlético that season. Atlético saw this domestic success as an opportunity to reinforce their squad for the upcoming <a href="2009-10%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> season. They replaced veteran goalkeeper <a href="Leo%20Franco">Leo Franco</a> with <a href="David%20de%20Gea">David de Gea</a> from the youth ranks and signed promising youngster <a href="Sergio%20Asenjo">Sergio Asenjo</a> from <a href="Real%20Valladolid">Real Valladolid</a>. Atlético also purchased <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> defender and Spanish international <a href="Juanito%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201976%29">Juanito</a> on a free transfer. Despite pressure from big clubs to sell star players Agüero and Forlán, Atlético remained committed to keeping their strong attacking base in the hopes for a successful new season.
The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20La%20Liga">2009–10</a> season, however, began poorly with many defeats and goals conceded. On 21 October, Atletico were hammered 4–0 by <a href="Premier%20League">English</a> club <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in the Champions League group stage. This defeat led Atletico's management to announce that manager <a href="Abel%20Resino">Abel Resino</a> had to leave. After failing to sign Danish former footballer <a href="Michael%20Laudrup">Michael Laudrup</a>, Atlético Madrid made it official that the new manager for the rest of the season would be <a href="Quique%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Flores">Quique Sánchez Flores</a>.
The Sánchez Flores years (2009–2011).
With the arrival of Sánchez Flores as coach in October 2009, Atlético improved in many of their competitions. Atlético continued to lag somewhat in La Liga during the <a href="2009-10%20La%20Liga">2009–10 season</a>, finishing in ninth position, but managed to finish third in their <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2009–10 UEFA Champions League</a> group stage and subsequently entered the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> in the round of 32. Atlético went on to win the Europa League, beating English teams <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> in the semi-finals and eventually <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in the <a href="2010%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">final</a> held at <a href="Volksparkstadion">HSH Nordbank Arena</a> in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> on 12 May 2010. <a href="Diego%20Forl%C3%A1n">Diego Forlán</a> scored twice, the second being an extra-time winner in the 116th minute, as Atlético won 2–1.
It was the first time since the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup</a> that Atlético had claimed a European title. They also reached the <a href="2010%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey final</a> on 19 May 2010, where they faced <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, but lost 2–0 at <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. By winning the Europa League, they qualified for the <a href="2010%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2010 UEFA Super Cup</a> against <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a>, winner of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2009–10 UEFA Champions League</a>. The match was played in <a href="Stade%20Louis%20II">Stade Louis II</a>, <a href="Monaco">Monaco</a> on 27 August 2010. Atlético won 2–0 with goals from <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Reyes">José Antonio Reyes</a> and Sergio Agüero, Atlético's first win in the <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>.
Atlético had a comparatively disappointing 2010–11 season, finishing only seventh in the League and being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> and the group stage of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>. This ultimately led to the departure of manager Sánchez Flores before the conclusion of the season, who was replaced with ex-Sevilla manager <a href="Gregorio%20Manzano">Gregorio Manzano</a>. Manzano secured the final Europa League place for Atlético. Manzano himself was replaced with <a href="Diego%20Simeone">Diego Simeone</a> in December 2011 after a poor run of form in La Liga.
Simeone era (2011–present).
Simeone led Atlético to their second <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> win in the three years since its creation. Atlético beat <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> 3–0 in the final on 9 May 2012 at <a href="Arena%20Na%C8%9Bional%C4%83">National Arena</a> in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> with two goals from <a href="Radamel%20Falcao">Radamel Falcao</a> and one from <a href="Diego%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201985%29">Diego</a>. By winning the Europa League again, Atlético qualified for the <a href="2012%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2012 UEFA Super Cup</a> against <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, winner of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">previous season's Champions League</a>. The game was played at Stade Louis II, Monaco on 31 August 2012; Atlético won 4–1, including a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> by Falcao in the first half. On 17 May 2013, Atlético beat Real Madrid 2–1 in the <a href="2013%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">Copa del Rey Final</a> in a tense match where both teams finished with 10 men. This ended a 14-year and 25-match winless streak in <a href="El%20Derbi%20madrile%C3%B1o">the Madrid derby</a>. The <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20season">2012–13 season</a> saw the club finish with three trophies in a little over a year.
On 17 May 2014, a 1–1 draw at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> secured the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">La Liga title</a> for Atlético, their first since 1996, and the first title since <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20La%20Liga">2003–04</a> not won by Barcelona or Real Madrid. One week later, Atlético faced city rivals Real Madrid in their first <a href="2014%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">Champions League final</a> since 1974, and the first played between two sides from the same city. They took a first-half lead through <a href="Diego%20God%C3%ADn">Diego Godín</a> and led until the third minute of injury time, when <a href="Sergio%20Ramos">Sergio Ramos</a> headed in an equaliser from a corner; the match went to extra time, and Real ultimately won 4–1. Atlético reached a second Champions League final in three seasons in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2015–16</a>, again facing Real Madrid, and lost on penalties after a 1–1 draw.
The club played their last home game at the <a href="Vicente%20Calder%C3%B3n%20Stadium">Vicente Calderón Stadium</a> on 21 May 2017, thereby moving to a new home, the refurbished <a href="Wanda%20Metropolitano">Wanda Metropolitano</a> in eastern Madrid.
In 2018, they won their third <a href="2017-18%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> title in nine years by beating <a href="Olympique%20de%20Marseille">Marseille</a> 3–0 in the <a href="2018%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">final</a> at <a href="Parc%20Olympique%20Lyonnais">Stade de Lyon</a> in <a href="Metropolis%20of%20Lyon">Lyon</a>, courtesy of a brace from <a href="Antoine%20Griezmann">Antoine Griezmann</a> and a goal from club captain <a href="Gabi%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29">Gabi</a> in what would be his last match for the club. Atlético also won another <a href="2018%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> after beating Real Madrid 4–2 at the outset of the following season at the <a href="A.%20Le%20Coq%20Arena">Lilleküla Arena</a> in <a href="Tallinn">Tallinn</a>.
On 22 May 2021, a 2–1 win at the <a href="Estadio%20Jos%C3%A9%20Zorrilla">José Zorrilla Stadium</a> against <a href="Real%20Valladolid%20CF">Valladolid</a> secured the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20La%20Liga">La Liga title</a> for Atlético, seven years after their last triumph.

Rivalries.
Real Madrid.
<a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> and Atlético Madrid are clubs with contrasting identities and different fates. While Real Madrid's <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu</a> proudly rises on <a href="Paseo%20de%20la%20Castellana">Paseo de la Castellana</a> in the <a href="upper%20class">wealthy</a> <a href="Chamart%C3%ADn%20%28Madrid%29">Chamartín</a> neighbourhood of northern Madrid, Atlético's former stadium, the less glamorous <a href="Vicente%20Calder%C3%B3n%20Stadium">Vicente Calderón</a>, stood in the central-south of Madrid 1.8 km from the city center in the <a href="working%20class">working class</a> barrio of <a href="Arganzuela">Arganzuela</a>. Historically, Real Madrid have long been seen as the <a href="The%20Establishment">establishment</a> club. On the other side, Atlético Madrid were always characterized by a "sentimiento de rebeldía", a sense of rebellion, although during the early <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> years, it was Atlético that was the preferred team of the regime. They were associated with the military airforce (renamed Atlético Aviación), until the regime's preferences moved towards Real Madrid in the 1950s.
Certainly, the dictatorial state sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's European Cup trophies at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; "Real Madrid are the best embassy we ever had", said Franco's foreign minister Fernando Maria de Castiella. Such perceptions have had an important impact on the city's footballing identities, tapping into the <a href="collective%20consciousness">collective consciousness</a>. In this vein, Atlético fans were probably the originators, and are the most frequent singers, of the song, sung to the tune of the Real Madrid anthem, "Hala Madrid, hala Madrid, el equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país", "Go Madrid, go Madrid, the government's team, the country's shame."
Until recently, Atlético Madrid had struggled significantly in the derby, carrying a 14-year winless streak into the <a href="2012-13%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid%20season">2012–13 season</a>. This spell ended, however, on 17 May 2013 after Atlético beat their city rivals 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu in the <a href="2013%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2013 Copa del Rey Final</a>, and continued on 29 September 2013 when they won a 1–0 victory, again at the Bernabéu.
The two faced each other in the <a href="2014%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">2014</a> and <a href="2016%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final">2016 UEFA Champions League final</a>s, with Real Madrid winning both matches.
Barcelona.
Although less famous than the Derbi Madrileño, a historic rivalry exists between Atlético Madrid and <a href="Futbol%20Club%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, which is also considered one of the "Classics" of Spanish football. Once lopsided in favor of the Catalan club, this rivalry has become competitive since the early 2010s, marked by events such as the 2016 Champions League knockout phase where Atletico Madrid upset Barcelona, the controversial departure of <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">French</a> striker <a href="Antoine%20Griezmann">Antoine Griezmann</a> from the Madrid club to the Catalan club in 2019 (and his subsequent return in 2021 amid Barcelona's financial struggles), and the surprise move of <a href="Luis%20Su%C3%A1rez">Luis Suárez</a> to Atlético in 2020, a move which saw the Uruguyan star play a crucial role in the team's championship run. However, by tradition and current affairs, the greatest rivalry is that which exists with its "<a href="Real%20Madrid">merengues</a>" neighbors.
International competition record.
Atlético has played at the European stage regularly since its <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20European%20Cup">1958–59 European Cup</a> debut, subsequently entering the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> (<a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1961–62</a>), the <a href="Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a> (<a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1963–64</a>), the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> (<a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20UEFA%20Cup">1971–72</a>) and the <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> (<a href="2010%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2009–10</a>). Starting with the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20La%20Liga">1999–00 relegation</a> Atlético did not qualify for European competitions for seven years, but from the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">2007–08 season</a>, it has taken part in either the Champions League or the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> every year, enjoying success in both competitions.
Players.
Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the <a href="ACP%20countries">ACP countries</a> in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the <a href="Cotonou%20Agreement">Cotonou Agreement</a> are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the <a href="Kolpak%20ruling">Kolpak ruling</a>.
Ownership and overseas properties.
Since 2002, <a href="Enrique%20Cerezo">Enrique Cerezo</a> Torres serves as the club president, whereas <a href="Miguel%20%C3%81ngel%20Gil%20Mar%C3%ADn">Miguel Ángel Gil Marín</a> (son of former club president <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Gil">Jesús Gil</a>) serves as chief executive officer. After a 2021 <a href="capital%20increase">capital increase</a>, Gil Marín, Cerezo and incoming investor <a href="Ares%20Management">Ares Management</a> Corporation hold a 66.98% of the shares by means of 'Atlético HoldCo'.
Atlético co-owns <a href="Liga%20MX">Liga MX</a> club <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20San%20Luis">Atlético San Luis</a>, and the <a href="Canadian%20Premier%20League">Canadian Premier League</a> side <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Ottawa">Atlético Ottawa</a>. The club also co-owned the <a href="Indian%20Super%20League">Indian Super League</a> (ISL) franchise in <a href="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, formerly named <a href="ATK%20%28football%20club%29">Atlético de Kolkata</a>, which won the competition twice, but in 2017 ended its partnership with the club as <a href="Sanjeev%20Goenka">Sanjeev Goenka</a> bought its shares.
In October 2018, Atletico De Madrid announced their first academy in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> which was based in <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>, which was the first European football academy in Pakistan. In April 2019, they launched "Football School Program" in <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>. In October 2019, Atletico De Madrid conducted talents in <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>. In February 2020, Pakistan Football Federation announced the 2020–21 Football Federation League in which Atletico Madrid Lahore was included in Group C and was made a professional Pakistani football club. It made its debut against Hazara Coal and won by 2–0.
Israeli businessman and billionaire <a href="Idan%20Ofer">Idan Ofer</a>, owns 33% of Atlético Madrid's stakes.
Colours and badge.
Atlético's home kit is red and white vertical striped shirts, blue shorts, and blue and red socks. This combination has been used since 1911.
The club's badge which was firstly introduced in 1917 featuring the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Madrid">Coat of arms of Madrid</a>, then incorporated into the club's jersey from 1947, was remodeled in 2016, yet a vote on 30 June 2023 revealed that 88.68% of club members wanted to reinstate the historical badge, which would be represented on July 1, 2024.
Nicknames.
Throughout their history the club has been known by a number of nicknames, including "Los Colchoneros" ("The Mattress Makers"), due to their first team stripes being the same colours as traditional <a href="mattress">mattress</a>es. During the 1970s, they became known as "Los Indios", which some attribute to the club's signing several South American players after the restrictions on signing foreign players were lifted. However, there are a number of alternative theories which claim they were named so because their stadium was "camped" on the river bank, or because "Los Indios" (The Indians) were the traditional enemy of "Los Blancos" (The Whites), which is the nickname of the club's <a href="Madrid%20Derby">city rivals</a>, Real Madrid. <a href="Felipe%20VI">Felipe VI</a>, the king of Spain, has been the honorary president of the club since 2003.

The club plays home fixtures in the <a href="Metropolitano%20Stadium">Cívitas Metropolitano</a>, which was expanded from a 20,000 seat capacity (when it was known as La Peineta) to 68,000 after it was used for <a href="Madrid%20bid%20for%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics">Madrid's failed bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics</a>.
Following the renovation of the stadium, the refurbished venue hosted its first competitive match pitting Atlético against <a href="Malaga%20CF">Malaga CF</a>, in which <a href="Antoine%20Griezmann">Antoine Griezmann</a> scored the club's first goal at the stadium.
Training ground.
The club's training ground is the <a href="Ciudad%20Deportiva%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20de%20Madrid">Ciudad Deportiva Atlético de Madrid</a> in <a href="Majadahonda">Majadahonda</a>, around 20 km west of Madrid. The facility maintains grass and artificial pitches as well as a gym. Both the senior and youth squads train at the club-owned facilities.
Atlético also runs a sports academy at the <a href="Estadio%20Cerro%20del%20Espino">Ciudad Deportiva del Nuevo Cerro del Espino</a> in Majadahonda. The club also runs an academy in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, Romania, its first in Europe.
Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors.
Atlético began playing in blue and white, mirroring then-parent club <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>, but both changed to red-and-white stripes by 1911 which became their traditional colours. The change took hold because red and white striped tops were the cheap to make, as the same combination was used to make bed mattresses, and the unused cloth was easily converted into football shirts. The kit has been made by <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> since 2001, as the company wants to provide competition with rival brand <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>, who have a long-term deal with <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>.
The club's main shirt sponsorship by the government of <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> between 2012 and 2014, featuring the slogan 'Land of Fire', was condemned by <a href="Reporters%20Without%20Borders">Reporters Without Borders</a>, who satirized it in a campaign visual in which the shirt's vertical stripes become prison bars with the logo "Azerbaijan, Land of Repression". Atlético Madrid admitted its sponsorship deal had a political dimension, saying the intention was to "promote the image of Azerbaijan". In August 2014, the <a href="Helsinki%20Foundation%20for%20Human%20Rights">Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights</a> wrote to Atlético, calling on it to end the sponsorship by and promotion of Azerbaijan because of the country's human rights record, calling it "one of the most repressive countries in the world".
In its 2003–04 season, the club was sponsored by <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, who would change the shirt sponsor's logo, and occasionally the shirt itself, as they did with the away shirt when "<a href="Spider-Man%202">Spider-Man 2</a>" was in cinemas. This kit sponsorship deal featured 16 separate film titles – an unprecedented number, which has not since been replicated as of 2022. Films included Columbia Picture's 2004 film "<a href="White%20Chicks">White Chicks</a>", which received mixed commentary. Because shirts would have to be introduced and removed from shops at a very fast pace to keep up with film releases, Nike decided to not include a sponsor's logo on replica shirts made from 2002 to 2005.
Supporters.
<a href="Frente%20Atl%C3%A9tico">Frente Atlético</a> is an ultra group of Club Atlético de Madrid founded with that name in 1982. They had around 2,500 members in 2014, one of the largest ultra groups in Spanish football. That same year, Atlético Madrid expelled Frente Atlético and prohibited the display of its symbols in the stadium.
FA are friends with Ruch Chorzow, Roma, Fortuna Düsseldorf, Real Betis and Sporting Gijón.
Also they have a great rivalry with the ultras of Real Madrid, Sevilla, Espanyol, Valencia, Rayo Vallecano, Deportivo, Celta, Real Sociedad, Athletic, Osasuna, Alavés, Zaragoza, Malaga, Valladolid, Oviedo, Oporto, Sporting Lisbon, Benfica, Lazio and Marseille. They also have bad relations and constant incidents with a former section of the group called Suburbios Firm.

History.
Early years.
Real Zaragoza was originally formed from two rival teams: "<a href="Iberia%20SC">Iberia SC</a>" and "<a href="Zaragoza%20CD">Real Zaragoza CD</a>". In 1939, after three years without football due to the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, the team made its first appearance in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20La%20Liga">ending in 7th position out of 12 teams</a>, but <a href="1940%E2%80%9341%20La%20Liga">being relegated in 1941</a>. The club returned to the top division one year later, only to be <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20La%20Liga">immediately relegated back</a>. It remained in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> until the end of the <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1950–51 campaign</a>, when it achieved promotion by finishing second in a play-off league.
On 8 September 1957, the team left its original stadium, El Torrero, for its current stadium, <a href="La%20Romareda">La Romareda</a>.
The golden era.
Beginning in the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20La%20Liga">1960–61 season</a>, Zaragoza enjoyed a period of great success, showcasing some of the greatest players playing in Spain during that decade, which earned for themselves the designation of "Los Magníficos". While the team failed to capture the league title, it finished in the top five every year until <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20La%20Liga">1968–69</a>, with two third-place finishes, and also won its first two <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> titles and the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Inter-Cities%20Fairs%20Cup">1963–64 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</a>.
Zaragoza's famous attacking line included <a href="Can%C3%A1rio">Canário</a>, <a href="Carlos%20Lapetra">Carlos Lapetra</a>, <a href="Marcelino%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Marcelino</a>, <a href="Eleuterio%20Santos">Eleuterio Santos</a> and <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20Villa">Juan Manuel Villa</a>. The Peruvian <a href="Juan%20Seminario">Juan Seminario</a>, who started his career in Spain with "Los Maños" before moving to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, won the <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">Pichichi Trophy</a> in the <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20La%20Liga">1961–62 campaign</a>, scoring 25 goals in 30 matches as Zaragoza finished in fourth position.
1970s to the end of the century.
Zaragoza finished third in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20La%20Liga">1973–74</a> and a best-ever second in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20La%20Liga">the following season</a>, losing the title in the last round to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. The club was also defeated 0–1 in the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1976 domestic cup final</a> against <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, spending two seasons in the second level during the decade, with promotion at the first attempt on either occasion.
In <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Copa%20del%20Rey">1986</a>, Zaragoza won its third Copa del Rey, defeating Barcelona 1–0. The club finished the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20La%20Liga">1990–91 season</a> in 17th position, thus having to appear in the <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion/relegation</a> play-offs against <a href="Real%20Murcia">Real Murcia</a>; on 19 June 1991, after a 0–0 away draw, a 5–2 home win meant the team managed to maintain its top level status.
<a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Víctor Fernández</a> was appointed manager in 1991. On 10 May 1995, <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Real%20Zaragoza%20season">one year</a> after <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Copa%20del%20Rey">winning the Copa del Rey</a> against <a href="Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a>, Zaragoza <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">won</a> the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> at the <a href="Parc%20des%20Princes">Parc des Princes</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, after having disposed of the likes of <a href="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> "en route". With the score level at 1–1, the two teams entered <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a> and, in the 120th minute, <a href="Nayim">Nayim</a> hit a half-volley from just past the halfway line, putting it beyond the reach of goalkeeper <a href="David%20Seaman">David Seaman</a> for the final <a href="1995%20UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup%20Final">2–1</a>. The club then contested the <a href="1995%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">1995 UEFA Super Cup</a> against <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>, losing 1–5 on aggregate despite a home draw in the first leg. Víctor Fernández was dismissed from his post in early November 1996, after only winning one league match <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20La%20Liga">that season</a>.
The 21st century.
The 2000s brought a further two Copa del Rey titles to Zaragoza's trophy cabinet, including the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2003–04 edition</a> against Real Madrid in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> (3–2 after extra time). However, the club also suffered top flight relegation in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20La%20Liga">2002</a> after <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20La%20Liga">narrowly avoiding so the previous season</a>, but <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">achieved immediate promotion in 2003</a>. In late May 2006, Agapito Iglesias purchased Alfonso Solans' shares and took control of the club, promising to build one of the strongest teams in Spain and Europe. In his first year in charge, he purchased <a href="Pablo%20Aimar">Pablo Aimar</a> from <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> for <a href="Euro">€</a>11 million, and former manager Víctor Fernández also returned to the club.
Mainly due to <a href="Diego%20Milito">Diego Milito</a>'s 23 goals in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">2006–07</a> (he finished third to <a href="A.S.%20Roma">Roma</a>'s <a href="Francesco%20Totti">Francesco Totti</a> and Real Madrid's <a href="Ruud%20van%20Nistelrooy">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a> – 26 and 25 goals, respectively – in the <a href="European%20Golden%20Shoe">European Golden Shoe</a> race), Real Zaragoza finished in sixth position, thus <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">qualifying</a> to the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>. However, <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">the following season</a> ended in relegation (18th position among 20 teams with only 10 wins in 38 matches, among them only 1 away win in 19 games) – for the second time in the decade – with the side also being eliminated in the first round in <a href="UEFA">European competition</a>. Legendary club coach Víctor Fernández returned for a second spell, although he was sacked in January 2008, as the club had four managers during the campaign. On the last matchday, a brace from <a href="Ricardo%20Oliveira">Ricardo Oliveira</a> proved insufficient in a 2–3 away loss against <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">Mallorca</a>, with the team totalling 42 points to <a href="CA%20Osasuna">Osasuna</a>'s 43.
Zaragoza achieved promotion from the second division <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">at the first attempt</a>. On the last matchday, on 20 June 2009, the team drew 2–2 at <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a> with goals from youth graduate <a href="David%20Generelo">David Generelo</a> and ex-Real Madrid <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">defender</a> <a href="Francisco%20Pav%C3%B3n">Francisco Pavón</a>, only trailing champions <a href="Xerez%20CD">Xerez</a> in the table. Nevertheless, that season Zaragoza was the best team at home, gained 50 from their 81 points in home games. However, after four seasons mainly spent in the bottom half of the table, Zaragoza was relegated following the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20La%20Liga">2012–13 Liga season</a> after finishing last.
In April 2022, the purchase of 51% of the shares of the SAD by an international investment fund led by <a href="Jorge%20Mas">Jorge Mas</a> was disclosed.

CD Málaga

Club Deportivo Málaga was a <a href="List%20of%20football%20clubs%20in%20Spain">Spanish football club</a> based in <a href="M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a>, in the autonomous community of <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>. It played twenty seasons in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, before being dissolved in 1992.
History.
Origins.
The first football club in Málaga was established in 1904, with the formation of the "Málaga Foot-Ball Club". It was nothing more than a society intended to promote football, a new sport in the city, carried from the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Its first rivals were small teams formed by crews of foreign ships arriving in the local harbor. In 1907, further attempts of popularizing football were performed by Málaga FC.
1912 saw the arrival of a rival club, "FC Malagueño", and the establishment of a great rivalry with Málaga FC, which had merged with other minor clubs like Málaga Racing. In 1927, Málaga FC became the "Real Málaga FC" after they were granted royal patronage by <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XIII</a>.
During the 1929–30 season both Real Málaga FC and FC Malagueño clubs became founding members of the "<a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a>". In late 1930, Real Málaga FC, were reformed as the "Málaga Sport Club".
Club merging in 1933.
In 1933 "Málaga SC" and "FC Malagueño" merged to become "Club Deportivo Malacitano", although it wasn't a real merging at all, but a name change of FC Malagueño, which had economic wealth and a better squad than Málaga SC. By this operation, the "CD Malacitano" was able to heir the squad of FC Malagueño, having their contracts cancelled in the other way.
In 1934 this new club made its debut in the "<a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>" when the division was expanded from ten teams to twenty four. After various seasons in the "Segunda División", with the competition interrupted because of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>.
In 1941 the club changed their name to the "Club Deportivo Málaga" when the new <a href="Estadio%20La%20Rosaleda">La Rosaleda</a> stadium was inaugurated.
First promotion to La Liga in 1949, first topflight years.
In 1949, Málaga was promoted for the first time to "La Liga" after several seasons in the "Segunda División" and a couple in the third level.
With chairman Miguel Navarro Nogueroles and coach Luís Urquiri, the club managed to get promoted in the last play of the 1948–49 season, in second position after <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, and thanks to positive <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a> with <a href="Granada%20CF">Granada CF</a>. Notable <a href="Striker%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> <a href="Pedro%20Baz%C3%A1n">Pedro Bazán</a>, who had previously scored nine goals in a sole match against the <a href="H%C3%A9rcules%20CF">Hércules CF</a> on January 4, 1949 in the Segunda División. He was the top goal scorer with 266 total goals and also one of the most important players of the team.
In this first run in "La Liga", Málaga stayed for two consecutive seasons, with notable former player <a href="Ricardo%20Zamora">Ricardo Zamora</a> as coach of the team, and until the first relegation of the club at the end of 1950–51 season, lacking just one point to maintain status.
In the subsequent seasons, Málaga achieved two new promotions to La Liga in 1951–52 and 1953–54, being relegated after just one year in both. The 1952–53 season was notable because of a resounding 6–0 thrashing of the <a href="Real%20Madrid">Real Madrid</a> at La Rosaleda, the major result up to date for Málaga against that club.
The golden years in the early 1970s.
After several new fleeting first level promotions in the 1960s, which turned out in immediate relegations, Málaga were promoted once again in 1969–70 under the command of chairman Antonio Rodríguez López and coach <a href="Jen%C5%91%20K%C3%A1lm%C3%A1r">Jenő Kálmár</a>, to start a five-year top flight stay. However, president in charge Antonio Rodríguez López was brutally murdered by the <a href="Mafia">Mafia</a> in the year 1971, and was replaced by Rafael Serrano Carvajal for the next season.
With notable players like Miguel Ramos Vargas "Migueli", <a href="Sebastian%20Viberti">Sebastian Viberti</a>, Juan Antonio Deusto and José Díaz Macías, the club achieved two seven league places in 1971–72 and 1973–74 (best results of the club up to date), a <a href="Ricardo%20Zamora%20Trophy">Ricardo Zamora Trophy</a> in 1971–72 season performed by <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> Deusto, and a 1972–73 run of the club in <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">the Spanish Cup</a>, where they were dumped out in the semifinals by <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>. They also notably scored a victory at <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a> for the first time after winning against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a> at the end of the 1971–72 season. The club also established in 1973 an official anthem, "Málaga La Bombonera", and from that moment the song is still the official anthem of the club.
After a polemic exit by Viberti at the end of 1973–74 season, the so-called "golden years" ended with a new relegation to the second level in 1974–75.
Dissolution.
In 1992, CD Málaga dissolved after financial difficulties.
Trofeo Costa del Sol.
Between 1961 and 1983, Málaga organised its own summer tournament, the "<a href="Trofeo%20Costa%20del%20Sol">Trofeo Costa del Sol</a>". The hosts won it on three occasions, successively defeating <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> and <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>. In 2003, the competition was revived by Club Deportivo's successor, <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20CF">Málaga CF</a>.
In 1976, CD Málaga won a similar summer trophy, the "Trofeo Ciudad de La Línea", played in <a href="La%20L%C3%ADnea%20de%20la%20Concepci%C3%B3n">La Línea de la Concepción</a>, near <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. The triumph arrived after <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootout</a> defeats of <a href="FC%20Dinamo%20Tbilisi">FC Dinamo Tbilisi</a> and <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia CF</a>, after 0–0 draws.

CA Osasuna

Club Atlético Osasuna (, "Osasuna Athletic Club"), or simply Osasuna, is a Spanish professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club in <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a>, <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a>. Founded on 24 October 1920, the club currently plays in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, holding home games at the 23,516-capacity <a href="El%20Sadar%20Stadium">El Sadar Stadium</a>. The team's regular home kit is a red shirt with navy blue shorts. Osasuna is one of four professional La Liga clubs to be owned by its members with an elected president.
Osasuna is the sole Navarrese club to have played in La Liga. Although the club has never won a national trophy, it reached the Copa del Rey final in <a href="2005%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2005</a> and <a href="2023%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20final">2023</a>. The club’s best league finishes were fourth in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20La%20Liga">1990–91</a> and <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20La%20Liga">2005–06</a>.
"Los Rojillos" or "Gorritxoak" is the club nickname, meaning "The Little Reds". The word "osasuna" means "health" in <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a>, used in a sense of "strength" or "vigour", which makes Osasuna the only team in La Liga with a Basque name. For different reasons, rivalries exist between Osasuna and <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a>, <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>, and <a href="Basque%20football%20derbies">some other Basque clubs</a>, particularly <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>.
Osasuna has a <a href="cantera">cantera</a> which has produced several successful players similar to other clubs in the greater Basque region.
History.
The club was founded on 24 October 1920 and its name, Osasuna, meaning "health" in <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a>, was chosen by Benjamín Andoian Martínez. When Spanish football became professional in 1928, Osasuna was placed in the third division, gaining promotion to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> after the <a href="1931%E2%80%9332%20Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1931–32 season</a> by winning the playoff against <a href="CD%20Nacional%20de%20Madrid">Nacional de Madrid</a>. They made it to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">three seasons later</a>. That same season, they reached the semi-finals of the <a href="1935%20Copa%20del%20Presidente%20de%20la%20Rep%C3%BAblica">Copa del Rey</a> and lost to <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>. The <a href="1936%20Copa%20del%20Presidente%20de%20la%20Rep%C3%BAblica">next season</a> , Osasuna reached the semi-finals again, this time losing to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> over two legs, despite grabbing a victory in the first leg.
The club was hit hard by the <a href="Navarre%23Republic%20and%20military%20uprising">rearguard repression</a> implemented by the Nationalist rebels in the <a href="Spanish%20coup%20of%20July%201936">1936 coup-de-état</a> against the Spanish Second Republic. At least ten players, employees and directive board members were murdered, imprisoned or otherwise persecuted. The surviving members were forcibly recruited for the front, with some of them showing enthusiasm for the putsch. The strong support of Navarre for the Nationalist rebels led to Osasuna being offered a place in the <a href="1939%E2%80%9340%20La%20Liga">1939–40 La Liga</a> when official competitions resumed, although they had finished last in <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20La%20Liga">1935–36</a> and should have been relegated; ultimately a play-off was arranged with the other demoted team <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Aviación</a> – associated with the <a href="Spanish%20Air%20Force">Spanish Air Force</a> and thus favoured by the military regime. The <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> team won the tie and, with support from their powerful backers, went on to claim the league title and retain it. It would not be until <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20La%20Liga">1953–54</a> that Osasuna again participated in the top division, and <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20La%20Liga">1956–57</a> when they managed to keep their place among the elite, remaining there for three further years.
In September 1967, Osasuna's <a href="El%20Sadar%20Stadium">El Sadar Stadium</a> was opened with a match between Osasuna and <a href="Vitoria%20de%20Setubal">Vitoria de Setubal</a>, with the hosts winning 3–0. The club achieved its first ever <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> qualification in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20UEFA%20Cup">1985–86</a> after <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20La%20Liga">finishing sixth in the league</a>; their campaign began in the first round, eliminating Scottish club <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> before being knocked out by Belgian club <a href="KSV%20Waregem">Waregem</a> 3–2 on aggregate. In the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20La%20Liga">1990–91 season</a>, Osasuna finished fourth in the league, their best ever league finish until then. This gave them qualification for the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20UEFA%20Cup">following season's UEFA Cup</a>, where the club reached the third round by eliminating <a href="Slavia%20Sofia">Slavia Sofia</a> and <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>. Finishing last in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20La%20Liga">1993–94</a>, the side spent six years in the second level, before finally being promoted in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1999–2000</a> after placing 2nd in the league table.
In the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2002–03 Copa del Rey</a>, Osasuna reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1988. The team entered the competition in the Round of 64, where they beat <a href="SD%20Lemona">Lemona</a>. In the following rounds, they beat <a href="SD%20Eibar">Eibar</a>, <a href="Real%20Uni%C3%B3n">Real Unión</a> and Sevilla, until the semi-finals where they were knocked out after losing to <a href="Recreativo%20de%20Huelva">Recreativo de Huelva</a> 4–2 on aggregate.
In <a href="2005%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">2005</a>, they reached the Copa del Rey final for the first time, losing to <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a>. They had a tough campaign in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Copa%20del%20Rey">that season's Copa Del Rey</a>, almost being eliminated in the round of 64 but narrowly beating <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a> side <a href="CD%20Castell%C3%B3n">Castellón</a> on penalties after a goalless draw. They went on to beat <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona</a> 1–0 in extra time, then Getafe, Sevilla and <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atletico Madrid</a> each by just one goal difference on aggregate to get to the final.
On 27 November 2005, Osasuna played their 1,000th game in La Liga. After a stellar <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20La%20Liga">2005–06 domestic campaign</a>, they made history by finishing in fourth place – equalling the best-ever finish – to enter the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">qualifying</a> phase for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> in the following season. This achievement was made more dramatic by the suspense that was maintained until the last day of the championship in which Osasuna and <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> were both vying for fourth place – both eventually ended the season with the same number of points but Osasuna finished higher due to their head-to-head record. However, they did not make it to the Champions League group phase, after being eliminated by <a href="Hamburger%20SV">Hamburger SV</a> in the third qualifying round, leaving the <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a>se to compete in the UEFA Cup for the fifth time.
Osasuna were drawn in Group D of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Cup">2006–07 UEFA Cup</a>, and qualified for the knockout stage after finishing second in the group. In the Round of 32, they and were drawn against <a href="FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, progressing 1–0 on aggregate, drawing 0–0 away before winning 1–0 in Pamplona through an extra time winner by <a href="Javad%20Nekounam">Javad Nekounam</a>. Osasuna's next opponent was Rangers, and Osasuna again progressed following a 1–1 draw in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and a 1–0 win at home. The club was drawn against German side <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> in the quarter-finals. Regarded as severe underdogs, Osasuna not only progressed to the semi-finals but did so in style (a 3–0 away win had virtually sealed the tie, but the "Rojillos" also won the second leg, 1–0). In the semi-finals, the club was drawn against <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Cup">holders</a> and fellow Spanish side Sevilla, eventually losing 1–2 on aggregate after a 1–0 home win.
In the following two seasons, Osasuna struggled heavily in the league. In <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">2007–08</a>, they finished 17th and only one point above relegation. In <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">2008–09</a>, they only avoided relegation in the final day; being in 18th place and entering the final matchday at home to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, the club fell behind but came back with two goals (the decider courtesy of <a href="Juanfran%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201985%29">Juanfran</a>, a "Merengue" youth graduate) to beat 9-men "Los Blancos" and remain in the top flight by finishing 15th.
Osasuna had great success in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20La%20Liga">2011–12</a>, finishing seventh and one place away from qualifying for the European places, but struggled again in the next 2 seasons, finishing 16th in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20La%20Liga">2012–13</a> and being relegated to the second division after an 18th-place finish in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">2013–14</a>. In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20La%20Liga">2014–15</a> season, the club managed to end up one position above the relegation zone. A managerial change resulted in substantial improvement, and Osasuna won the final match of the regular <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2015–16 season</a> 0–5 away to <a href="Real%20Oviedo">Oviedo</a>, finishing sixth in the table and qualifying for promotion playoffs and. They subsequently won all the playoff games – against <a href="Gimn%C3%A0stic%20de%20Tarragona">Gimnàstic de Tarragona</a> in the semi-final and <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona</a> in the final – to achieve promotion to La Liga once again. Osasuna finished <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20La%20Liga">2016–17</a> in 19th position, resulting in relegation. They could only manage 8th in their <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">first campaign</a> back in the second tier.
On 20 May 2019, Osasuna achieved promotion back to La Liga after <a href="Granada%20CF">Granada</a>'s victory over <a href="Albacete%20Balompi%C3%A9">Albacete</a>, mathematically ensuring a promotion place with three matches left in the season. On 31 May, they defeated <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%20CF">Córdoba</a> to finish as <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2018–19 Segunda División</a> champions.
The club celebrated its centenary in October 2020 with a league victory over Athletic Bilbao, albeit the match was played in an empty stadium owing to restrictions caused by the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Spain">COVID-19 pandemic in Spain</a>. In May 2021, after decades of silence and alongside other Navarrese institutions, club president Luis Sabalza paid homage for the first time to the members who went through the rearguard Nationalist repression during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, on behalf of the board of directors.
In 2023, having qualified on the field for the <a href="UEFA%20Conference%20League">UEFA Conference League</a> via a <a href="2022%E2%80%9323%20La%20Liga">7th place finish</a> in La Liga (they also reached the <a href="2023%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20final">2023 Copa del Rey final</a>, but lost to Real Madrid), Osasuna found itself embroiled in match-fixing allegations dating back to 2013, which led to an initial ban from participating (this being the first occasion they had been eligible for a UEFA competition since the events). The club decided to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), who ruled in their favour in deeming that the club was sufficiently distinct from the directors who committed the offences and reinstated their access to the Conference League. UEFA also initiated a disciplinary case against Osasuna for taking the matter to civil courts.
Kit evolution.
Red and navy blue are the colours of CA Osasuna, reflected in the home kit and club logo. The away kit tends to differ greatly from the home kit.
Rivalries.
Osasuna has many rivalries: these include Real Zaragoza, Real Madrid, and Athletic Bilbao.
The rivalry with Real Madrid began in December 1990, when Osasuna won 4–0 at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a>. The rivalry with Zaragoza wasn't always a heated rivalry, but hostility between the two clubs began during a match in October 1987, when Zaragoza fans threw an object at Osasuna goalkeeper <a href="Roberto%20Santamar%C3%ADa%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201962%29">Roberto Santamaría</a>. Since then, these matches often have altercations between fans and players, and it is known to be one of the most heated rivalries in Spain. In recent years however, there have been large periods of time where this rivalry match wasn't played, due to the clubs being in different divisions.

The club maintain rivalries with neighbours <a href="CD%20Legan%C3%A9s">Leganés</a>, who are based near the town of Getafe, <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> and <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>.
History.
Beginnings.
Sociedad Getafe Deportivo was founded in 1923, only playing in lower divisions from 1928 to 1932. After the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, in 1945 five Getafe locals – Enrique Condes García, Aurelio Miranda Olavaria, Antonio Corredor Lozano, Manuel Serrano Vergara and Miguel Cubero Francés – while meeting at La Marquesina bar, decided to form a local team. Officially founded on 24 February 1946, the club was named <a href="Getafe%20Deportivo">Club Getafe Deportivo</a>.
The club originally played in the Campo del Regimiento de Artillería, which lacked goal posts. Shortly after, the club moved to <a href="San%20Isidro%2C%20Alicante">San Isidro</a>, housed in the current Municipal Sports Center of San Isidro. Here, Club Getafe was promoted to the <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">third division</a> following their victory against <a href="CP%20Villarrobledo">Villarrobledo</a> in the 1956–57 season. Getafe was nearly promoted to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> in 1957–58, but was defeated by <a href="CA%20Almer%C3%ADa">CA Almería</a>.
On 2 September 1970, the club inaugurated its own stadium after being promoted back to the Tercera División. Presided by chairman Francisco Vara, <a href="Las%20Margaritas%20%28Madrid%29">Las Margaritas</a> won a 3–1 victory over Michelín. The team survived in the third level that season, and six years later gained their first promotion to the second division.
Second Division.
Club Getafe Deportivo played six seasons in the Segunda División, with little success. From 1976 to 1982, they placed below tenth level all six years.
In 1978, the club advanced to play against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> round of 16. Playing at home in the first leg, Getafe drew with a star-studded Barcelona team 3–3, before traveling away for the second leg and being thrashed 8–0 at the <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a>.
At the conclusion of the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1981–82 season</a>, players having not been paid, Getafe was automatically relegated and subsequently liquidated.
Meanwhile, on 1 September 1976, a new club was founded in the National Sports Council and the Regional Federation of Castille. The club was called Peña Madridista Getafe (the "<a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> supporters' club of Getafe"). This club played for four seasons in various divisions, until taking the name Club Deportivo Peña Getafe, and played under this name for a further two seasons. On 10 July 1982, they joined forces with the much older Club Getafe Promesas, and were registered again in the Regional Federation of Castille.
Present existence.
Based on the <a href="merger">merger</a> the previous year, the present Getafe Club de Fútbol was officially founded on 8 July 1983, after passing through assembly.
Starting in the regional leagues in 1983–84, Getafe was promoted for four consecutive seasons until reaching the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>. The club started a new period with its promotion into Segunda in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1994–95</a>, staying only two years. Threatening absolute disappearance just a few years later in 1997, Getafe survived relegation into the fourth level <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> following a two-legged playoff victory over <a href="SD%20Huesca">Huesca</a>.
Meanwhile, Getafe's current stadium, the <a href="Coliseum%20Alfonso%20P%C3%A9rez">Coliseum Alfonso Pérez</a>, was inaugurated on 1 January 1998.
Returning to the second division for <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1999–2000</a>, Getafe lasted another two seasons. However, one year later, they would return following an amazing promotion in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2001–02</a> during which one of their players, Sebastián "Sebas" Gómez, was murdered, and controversy regarding unpaid payments of players following a debt of <a href="Euro">€</a>3 million.
Consolidating their position after one year, Getafe had a fantastic <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">season</a> in Segunda. At the top of the table for most of the year, the side travelled to the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> on the final matchday needing a win to assure a historic promotion to <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, the top-flight. Amazingly, they defeated <a href="CD%20Tenerife">Tenerife</a> 5–3 with five goals from <a href="Sergio%20Pach%C3%B3n">Sergio Pachón</a>, thus becoming along with Real Madrid, <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> and <a href="Rayo%20Vallecano">Rayo Vallecano</a> the fourth team from the <a href="Community%20of%20Madrid">Community of Madrid</a> – and the first of them from outside of the <a href="Madrid">capital</a> – to ever play in La Liga. With this promotion, Getafe had ascended the whole <a href="Spanish%20football%20league%20system">Spanish football pyramid</a>, achieving this feat in only 20 years.
La Liga.
The club started <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20La%20Liga">2004–05</a> poorly, lying at the bottom of the table. Home wins over <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">Espanyol</a>, <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>, <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> and Real Madrid, followed by a sole away win of the season over Athletic Bilbao, saw Getafe climb to finish 13th, being the only promoted side to avoid relegation. At the end of the season, the club lost head coach <a href="Quique%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Flores">Quique Sánchez Flores</a> and several players to rival clubs. In Getafe's <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20La%20Liga">next season</a>, the club briefly topped the table before slipping to finish ninth. During the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>, Argentine-born <a href="Mariano%20Pern%C3%ADa">Mariano Pernía</a> became Getafe's first ever <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spanish international</a>, before moving to Atlético Madrid.
In <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20La%20Liga">2006–07</a>, Getafe again finished ninth in the league, conceding only 33 goals in 38 matches and <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> <a href="Roberto%20Abbondanzieri">Roberto Abbondanzieri</a> was awarded the <a href="Ricardo%20Zamora%20Trophy">Zamora Trophy</a>, having recorded 12 clean sheets. The highlight of the club's season was reaching the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Copa%20del%20Rey">2006–07 Copa del Rey</a> <a href="2007%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">final</a>, a competition in which Getafe had never reached the quarter-finals before. The run included a two-legged semi-final against Barcelona in which Getafe lost the first leg 5–2 at the Camp Nou before producing a 4–0 rout in the second leg at the Coliseum Alfonso Pérez. Getafe lost their first ever major final 1–0 to <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a>. Through this, the club qualified for the following season's <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> qualification, as Sevilla had already qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> through their league position.
<a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">The following season</a>, coach <a href="Bernd%20Schuster">Bernd Schuster</a> left after two seasons to become head coach at Real Madrid, and Getafe appointed <a href="Michael%20Laudrup">Michael Laudrup</a> as his replacement. Under Laudrup, Getafe again finished the league mid-table. In the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, the team managed to progress to the quarter-finals after finishing top of Group G, only losing once, setting up a tie against four-time European Cup winners <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>. Getafe drew the away leg 1–1, thanks to an injury time equaliser from <a href="Cosmin%20Contra">Cosmin Contra</a>. In the second leg, <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20de%20la%20Red">Rubén de la Red</a> was <a href="red%20card%20%28sports%29">sent off</a> after six minutes. Contra put Getafe ahead just before half-time, but in the 89th minute, <a href="Franck%20Rib%C3%A9ry">Franck Ribéry</a> equalized to send the match into <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a>. Two quick goals from <a href="Javier%20Casquero">Javier Casquero</a> and substitute <a href="Braulio%20N%C3%B3brega">Braulio</a> gave Getafe a 3–1 lead, but Bayern pulled a goal back from <a href="Luca%20Toni">Luca Toni</a>, before Toni again scored seconds before the end of extra time, giving Bayern an <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals</a> win. Getafe also had successful run in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a>, reaching <a href="2008%20Copa%20del%20Rey%20Final">the final</a> for a second year running. In the final, at the <a href="Vicente%20Calder%C3%B3n%20Stadium">Vicente Calderón Stadium</a>, Getafe were beaten 3–1 by Valencia.
In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20La%20Liga">2015–16 season</a>, Getafe were relegated to second division after spending 12 years in first campaign. However, in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2016–17</a>, the club immediately returned to La Liga after defeating <a href="SD%20Huesca">Huesca</a> and <a href="CD%20Tenerife">Tenerife</a> to gain promotion via <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%23Promotion%20play-offs">the play-offs</a>. In the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20La%20Liga">2017–18 season</a> Getafe finished in the 8th position, easily avoiding the relegation back to Segunda División.
2019–present.
In the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20La%20Liga">2018–19 season</a> Getafe finished 5th, their highest finish in the first division, and qualified for the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2019–20 UEFA Europa League</a> group stage. They finished 2nd in their group, with 12 points from 6 games, which allowed them to advance to the next round. They managed to beat <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> 3–2 on aggregate in the Round of 32. Due to that win, they faced <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> in the round of 16, where their European dream ended with a 2–0 loss.
Stadium.
Getafe play at the <a href="Estadio%20Coliseum">Estadio Coliseum</a>, located in Getafe. Its pitch dimensions are 105x70 metres. The stadium was inaugurated on 1 January 1998, named after the Spanish international (and of Real Madrid fame) <a href="Alfonso%20P%C3%A9rez">Alfonso Pérez</a>. Though he never played for or against Getafe, or even in the stadium, he is perhaps the most famous <a href="Association%20football">footballer</a> to come out of the area and was at the height of his career during the mid-1990s.
Before playing in the Coliseum, Getafe played their home matches at the nearby Estadio de las Margaritas, part of the greater <a href="Las%20Margaritas%20%28Madrid%29">Sports City of Las Margaritas</a>. The Coliseum was subsequently built as a natural extension to the much smaller facilities at Las Margaritas. Since its foundation, the stadium has had numerous renovations, and now seats 14,400 people and several thousand more standing. As such, the exact capacity is variable and ambiguous. Getafe generally fill the stadium for local matches against Real and Atlético Madrid, as well as against Barcelona, most famously in the 2006–07 Cup semi-final. For the first time in their history, Getafe pre-sold out the whole of the Coliseum before their second leg match against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup quarter-final.
Getafe club president <a href="%C3%81ngel%20Torres%20%28businessman%29">Ángel Torres</a> expressed interest in upgrading the Coliseum to a much greater 20,000 seat arena, in conjunction with <a href="Madrid%202012%20Olympic%20bid">Madrid's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games</a>. The failure of this bid and poor crowd averages put this redevelopment in doubt.
Getafe use the nearby Sports City when training. These facilities include several training pitches with both grass and artificial turf, full medical rooms and recuperation facilities.
Supporters.
Commonly called "Marea Azul", or "Azulones", Getafe supporters have steadily increased in number with the success of the team in recent years. There are 18 "peñas" ("supporter clubs") and 12,000 "socios" ("associates"). Former Real Madrid player <a href="Francisco%20Pav%C3%B3n">Francisco Pavón</a> is a well-known Getafe "socio", while <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a> and <a href="Rafael%20Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> have attended matches at the Coliseum in the past.
Getafe supporters have grown far beyond the local area and are now known to have fans in Australia, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic, Argentina, Scotland, Denmark, the United States and Mexico. In 2007, a "peña" was founded in Venezuela to extend the worldwide club reach.
Getafe also created some controversy in 2007 when their season ticket campaign included biblical references of <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and Jesus sacrificing themselves for the team. The club responded by withdrawing the first scene involving Abraham.
Upon important or famous victories, Getafe fans congregate to celebrate at the Cibelina statue in the town centre. Prior to the 2007 Cup final, Torres implored the fans to "tear down the Cibelina" upon victory, promising to pay for a new design. During that final, thousands of supporters rushed to get tickets and packed into the Santiago Bernabéu, yet were vastly outnumbered by "Sevillistas". However, those who failed to get tickets – most of which went to season ticket holders for the 2007–08 campaign – were able to watch the match on a big screen in Getafe's central square.
Getafe has also a small group of <a href="Ultras">Ultras</a> supporters, called "Comandos Azules" ("blue <a href="commandos">commandos</a>").
"Zombies Calientes de Getafe".
In 2011, Getafe released a humorous tongue-in-cheek advertising campaign, pretending to decry the club's relatively small fanbase and encouraging male supporters to <a href="Sperm%20donation">donate sperm</a> in order to breed more fans. To inspire those donations, the club produced a short <a href="pornographic%20film">pornographic film</a> called "Zombies Calientes de Getafe" (Horny Zombies of Getafe), "shot in the style of a 1970s porn film", and delivered it to sperm donation clinics in Madrid.
Rivalries.
Historically, due to their close geographical position, Getafe has always held a strong rivalry with <a href="CD%20Legan%C3%A9s">Leganés</a>. They played out numerous encounters in the lower division before the two teams fortunes began to contrast as Getafe gained ascendency and Leganés began to deteriorate.
In the first division, the side has held some exciting matches in the last few years with Real Madrid, with the ledger being most recently squared at three wins each. Real Madrid's much greater stature, huge budget and expensive squad has never stopped Getafe from rising to the challenge and often playing their best football against their "bigger brother".
In addition to this, Getafe has developed somewhat of a rivalry with Barcelona, which culminated in their famous 4–0 victory over their more fancied opponents during the 2006–07 Copa del Rey semi-final. Also, Valencia has succumbed numerous times to "el Geta", often quite heavily, as was the case during the 2006–07 Copa del Rey, which ensured Getafe's first ever appearance in the Copa's quarter-finals with a 2–4 win at Valencia's <a href="Mestalla%20Stadium">Mestalla Stadium</a>. However, this result was turned around in the 2008 Copa del Rey final, as Valencia would deny Getafe their first ever trophy with a 3–1 victory. This rivalry is propped up healthily by the regular transfer of Getafe players (and head coach <a href="Quique%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Flores">Quique Sánchez Flores</a>) to Valencia.
European record.
The club has not appeared in any European competition except in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> (formerly the UEFA Cup).
The club appeared only three times in this tournament, In <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">2007–08</a> they qualified for the tournament as <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Copa%20del%20Rey%23Final">Copa del Rey runner-up</a> in the previous season for <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, who qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, and progressed from the first round, group stage, round of 32 and round of 16 before being beaten by <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the quarter-finals. three years later, in <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2010–11</a> they were paired with <a href="APOEL%20FC">APOEL</a> in the playoff round, and qualified by eliminating them, but then they were eliminated from the group stage as third place.
In the <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2019–20</a> season, Getafe appeared in the tournament for the third time, and they were able to qualify from the group stage in second place, and they also managed to pass the round of 32 after eliminating <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>, but they were eliminated in the next round against <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> in one match due to the <a href="COVID-19%20pandemic%20in%20Italy">COVID-19 pandemic</a>.

Villarreal CF

Villarreal Club de Fútbol, <a href="Sociedad%20An%C3%B3nima%20Deportiva">S.A.D.</a>, usually abbreviated to Villarreal CF or simply Villarreal, is a Spanish professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Villarreal">Villarreal</a>, in the <a href="Province%20of%20Castell%C3%B3n">Castellón</a> province of eastern Spain, that plays in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, the top flight of <a href="Football%20in%20Spain">Spanish football</a>.
Founded in 1923, the club spent much time of its history in the lower divisions of Spanish football and began in La Liga in 1998. In the 21st century, Villarreal gained some league stability, although they sustained relegation in 2012, rebounding the next year and then remaining in the top division to date. The club made its first appearance in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> in 2005, with its best result being the semi-finals in 2006 and 2022. Villarreal also appeared in the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a> during this time, and won the competition in 2021 by defeating <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the <a href="2021%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">final</a>, clinching their first major trophy.
The club is nicknamed "El Submarí Groguet" or "El Submarino Amarillo" (<a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%28song%29">Yellow Submarine</a>) due to its yellow home kit, and due to being a low-profile team compared to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, and regional rivals <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>. They play their home games at the <a href="Estadio%20de%20la%20Cer%C3%A1mica">Estadio de la Cerámica</a>, and have been touted as an example of a small but successful club.
History.
1923–29: early years.
Villarreal CF was founded as Club Deportivo Villarreal on 10 March 1923 "to promote all sports especially Football." The stadium was rented for 60 <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a> a month and ticket prices were set at half a peseta for men and a quarter of a peseta for children. Women were granted free admission. On 17 June 1923, <a href="CD%20Castell%C3%B3n">Castellón</a>, a modern rival of the club, played the first match against a club named after <a href="Miguel%20de%20Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a>. On 21 October of that year, Villarreal played their first game ever, playing against Castellón. Villarreal started off with a kit of white shirts and black shorts, reflected in their first badge.
1929–98: time in lower divisions.
Villarreal entered regional competitions within the Spanish football pyramid from 1929 to 1930 onwards. The 1934–35 season saw the team lose to <a href="Cartagena%20CF">Cartagena</a> when a win would have seen them promoted to the nationwide Second Division. The following season saw Villarreal win the First Division of the region before the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>.
When the war finished in 1939, the club played again in the Second Division of the region. However, CD Villarreal was dissolved in the early 1940s, and in 1942, CA Foghetecaz, an acronym for the club's founders (Font, Gil, Herrero, Teuler, Catalá and Zaragoza), was one of several clubs established in its place. On 25 August 1947, the new club joined the Valencian Football Federation and in 1950 renamed itself as CAF Villarreal, where the F stood for Foghetecaz.
The name changed again to the current Villarreal CF in June 1954, with a badge similar to the present one. They finished seventh and then fourth twice in the First regional league before being promoted to the Tercera Liga (Third Nationwide) as champions in 1956. They were relegated in 1960–61 after finishing 14th.
The club adopted their present badge in the middle of 1966. In 1966–67, Villarreal returned to the Tercera as champions. In 1970, they reached the national Segunda for the first time. After narrowly avoiding relegation in their first season, they were relegated the following season. In 1975–76, they were relegated from the Tercera to the Regionals, but were promoted back again the next season. In 1986–87, Villarreal were promoted to the Segunda Liga B. In 1990, they finished 18th and were relegated back to the Tercera.
There were back-to-back promotions as the club returned to Segunda B and finished second, earning promotion to Segunda A for the first time. From 1992 to 1997, Villarreal were often in low or mid-table positions, but reached the play-offs in 1997–98 by finishing fourth. The two-legged play-off was against <a href="SD%20Compostela">Compostela</a>. Villarreal hosted the first leg which was a 0–0 draw, but the second leg at the home of the <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galician</a> team was a 1–1 draw, thus Villarreal were promoted on the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>.
1998–2012: La Liga and European debuts.
Villarreal's <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> debut started with a match against reigning <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European champions</a> <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> on 31 August 1998 where they lost 4-1 despite taking the lead after 3 minutes. The first home game was against <a href="RC%20Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a> the week after. Because of a difficult season, Villarreal were relegated to the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a> for the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1999–2000 season</a>, but by finishing third, they were then promoted back to the Primera División.
After finishing seventh on their return to the Primera, Villarreal finished in 15th place for two-straight seasons. Villarreal competed in the <a href="UEFA%20Intertoto%20Cup">UEFA Intertoto Cup</a> in the middle of 2002, defeating <a href="Fimleikaf%C3%A9lag%20Hafnarfjar%C3%B0ar">FH</a> of Iceland, <a href="Torino%20F.C.">Torino</a> of Italy, and <a href="Troyes%20AC">Troyes</a> of France. They lost in the final to compatriots <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20CF">Málaga</a>, 2–1 on aggregate.
In the middle of 2003, they defeated the Dutch team <a href="SC%20Heerenveen">Heerenveen</a> in the final of the Intertoto Cup, thereby qualifying for the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>. In their major European debut, Villarreal reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, losing to neighbours and eventual champions <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>. In the league, Villarreal finished in eighth place. In the middle of 2004, Villarreal retained the Intertoto Cup, beating compatriots <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a> on <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a> after the final finished 2–2 on aggregate. This qualified them to the UEFA Cup. They lost in the quarter-finals of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20UEFA%20Cup">2004–05 UEFA Cup</a> to Dutch side <a href="AZ%20Alkmaar">AZ</a>, losing 3–2 on aggregate. During the same season, Villarreal finished in third place in La Liga, earning the club their first direct qualification to a European tournament, the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>. The club's centre-forward <a href="Diego%20Forl%C3%A1n">Diego Forlán</a> won the <a href="Pichichi%20Trophy">Pichichi Trophy</a> for top scorer in the league, with 25 goals.
Villarreal defeated the English Premier League's <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> in a play-off for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> group stages. The group saw Villarreal go undefeated, drawing both games against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and achieving a draw and a win each against <a href="Lille%20OSC">Lille</a> of France and <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> of Portugal.

Arsenal went on to lose in the final in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to another Spanish club, <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. Villarreal finished seventh in La Liga, which only earned an Intertoto Cup position.
Villarreal contested the Intertoto Cup in the middle of 2006 and was knocked out in its first game, to <a href="NK%20Maribor">Maribor</a> of Slovenia. The first leg was lost 2–1 at home and the away game was a 1–1 draw. The team finished 5th in La Liga and qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. Villarreal gained their best-ever league position in 2008, finishing second to Real Madrid by eight points, and also reached the last 32 in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">that season's UEFA Cup</a>. After defeating <a href="FC%20BATE%20Borisov">BATE Borisov</a> of Belarus in a play-off, the team won Group C unbeaten. Their group opponents were <a href="ACF%20Fiorentina">Fiorentina</a> of Italy, <a href="FK%20Mlad%C3%A1%20Boleslav">Mladá Boleslav</a> of Czech Republic, <a href="IF%20Elfsborg">IF Elfsborg</a> of Sweden, and <a href="AEK%20Athens%20F.C.">AEK Athens</a> of Greece.

The club automatically qualified for the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2008–09 UEFA Champions League</a> by finishing second in La Liga the previous season. They drew Manchester United, for the second consecutive campaign, <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>, and <a href="AaB%20Fodbold">Aalborg BK</a>. They made a good start by holding current European champions Manchester United to a goal-less draw at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, a third 0–0 draw in a row against the English giants. A first win was sealed on 30 September by beating <a href="Gordon%20Strachan">Gordon Strachan</a>'s Celtic 1–0 at <a href="El%20Madrigal">El Madrigal</a>, courtesy of a <a href="Marcos%20Senna">Marcos Senna</a> free-kick. On 21 October, during a Champions League match against Aalborg, they scored six goals to three. The Spaniards went through to the knock-out stage after drawing 2–2 with Aalborg in Denmark and drawing goalless once again against Manchester United. In the last group stage match, they lost to an already-eliminated Celtic.
In the knock-out stage, they faced <a href="Panathinaikos%20F.C.">Panathinaikos</a>, who left Villarreal with a 1–1 away advantage, but lost 1–2 in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. Villarreal reached the quarter-finals for the second time in two attempts, and were once again paired with Arsenal. The first leg saw a 1–1 draw by a <a href="Marcos%20Senna">Marcos Senna</a> free kick, equalised by an <a href="Emmanuel%20Adebayor">Emmanuel Adebayor</a> volley. <a href="Theo%20Walcott">Theo Walcott</a>, <a href="Emmanuel%20Adebayor">Emmanuel Adebayor</a>, and <a href="Robin%20van%20Persie">Robin van Persie</a> secured a 3–0 win for Arsenal on the return, knocking Villarreal out of the tournament.
Despite finishing outside of a European qualifying spot in the domestic league, Villarreal was given a place in the qualifying round of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2010–11 UEFA Europa League</a> after UEFA determined that <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">Mallorca</a>'s financial irregularities precluded them from taking part in the tournament.
A 5–0 home win and a 2–1 away win against <a href="FC%20Dnepr%20Mogilev">Dnepr Mogilev</a> qualified them for the group stage. Villarreal suffered an early setback following a shock 2–0 loss in their away fixture against <a href="GNK%20Dinamo%20Zagreb">Dinamo Zagreb</a>. Despite this, however, later wins against Dinamo, <a href="Club%20Brugge%20KV">Club Brugge</a> and <a href="PAOK%20F.C.">PAOK</a> saw them top their group.
After beating <a href="S.S.C.%20Napoli">Napoli</a>, <a href="Bayer%2004%20Leverkusen">Bayer Leverkusen</a> and <a href="FC%20Twente">Twente</a> in the knockout phases, Villarreal qualified for the semi-finals to face tournament favourites <a href="FC%20Porto">Porto</a>. After Villarreal took a 0–1 lead at the <a href="Est%C3%A1dio%20do%20Drag%C3%A3o">Estádio do Dragão</a>, Porto made a remarkable turnaround that ended in a 5–1 defeat for Villarreal. Although Villarreal won the second leg 3–2, Porto's first leg goal total saw them advance to the final on aggregate, where they beat <a href="S.C.%20Braga">Braga</a> to be crowned champions. <a href="Giuseppe%20Rossi">Giuseppe Rossi</a> finished as the tournament's second top goalscorer with 11 goals, behind Porto's <a href="Radamel%20Falcao">Radamel Falcao</a>.
2012–present: relegation and European glory.
On 13 May 2012, Villarreal were relegated from La Liga after defeat to <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>. Following a horrendous season, the club suffered a shattering tragedy when <a href="Manuel%20Preciado%20Rebolledo">Manolo Preciado</a>, appointed as Villarreal's new manager on 6 June 2012, died of a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> later that day. Following their relegation, there was a mass exodus of players at the club, with star players such as <a href="Borja%20Valero">Borja Valero</a>, <a href="Diego%20L%C3%B3pez%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Diego López</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Rossi">Giuseppe Rossi</a> and <a href="Nilmar">Nilmar</a> leaving the side.
After one year in the Segunda División, Villarreal were promoted back to La Liga on the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">final day of the season</a> after finishing the year second after champions <a href="Elche%20CF">Elche</a>. The team began its new tenure in the top flight by winning its first three games; the winning streak ended with a tie against Real Madrid at El Madrigal, though the team was undefeated until falling to <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> 1–0 on the seventh matchday of the season. The Yellow Submarine finished the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20La%20Liga">2013–14 campaign</a> in sixth, thus qualifying them for next season's <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a>.
In <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20La%20Liga">2014–15</a>, Villarreal again finished the year in sixth, enough to secure direct qualification to the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> group stage. In the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20La%20Liga">2015–16</a> season, Villarreal led La Liga for the first time during the sixth and seventh weeks, before falling to fifth place the following week. The club ended the season in 4th place and thus advanced to the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2016–17 UEFA Champions League</a> playoff round. The club progressed to the semi-finals of the 2015–16 Europa League, but were knocked out by <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Villarreal won the first leg 1–0, but lost 3–0 in Liverpool and 3–1 on aggregate.
In <a href="2019%E2%80%9320%20La%20Liga">2019–20</a>, Villarreal finished fifth, earning a place in the <a href="2020%E2%80%9321%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2020–21 UEFA Europa League</a>. The team went on a memorable run, advancing to the <a href="2021%20UEFA%20Europa%20League%20Final">final</a> after knocking out <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 2–1 on aggregate. Facing favoured <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, Villarreal held them to a 1–1 draw after extra time and then won 11–10 in a penalty shoot-out, winning the club's first ever major trophy. Domestically, they finished seventh, supposedly qualifying for the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Europa%20Conference%20League">inaugural UEFA Europa Conference League</a>. However, courtesy of their triumph, Villarreal switched their next year's participation in the inaugural Conference League to the <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2021–22 Champions League</a>.
At the start of the 2021–22 season, Villarreal competed in the <a href="2021%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">2021 UEFA Super Cup</a> against <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, which ended a 1-1 draw after extra time, but <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> managed to win 6-5 in the penalty shootout as captain <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Albiol">Raúl Albiol</a> saw his penalty saved by <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> goalkeeper <a href="Kepa%20Arrizabalaga">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a>. That same season, Villarreal progressed to the semi-finals of the Champions League after knocking out <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> in the round of 16 and <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the quarter-finals, before losing 5–2 on aggregate to Liverpool.
Rivalries.
Villarreal has supported a long rivalry with <a href="CD%20Castell%C3%B3n">Castellón</a> for geographical reasons, since both are from the <a href="province%20of%20Castell%C3%B3n">province of Castellón</a>. They also rival <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a>, since the two had been the most competitive teams of the <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencian Community</a>; this clash is called the "<a href="Derbi%20de%20la%20Comunitat">Derbi de la Comunitat</a>".
Club colours.
The club's famous yellow kit dates back to 1947. With the new season fast approaching, the son of the then Villarreal president travelled to Valencia to purchase replacements of the club's official kit of white shirts and black shorts. Discovering that the shop had neither in stock, he instead bought the only color that they did have, which happened to be yellow. The players agreed that the shirts were suitable, although they weren't keen on the black shorts, so the president's son travelled to Castellón and purchased a batch of white shorts. The players voted that they should be dyed blue. After remaining as the club's official kit for some time, the yellow shirts and blue shorts combination was last worn in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20La%20Liga">2002–03</a> season, and the club has since sported all-yellow kits. Away colours have been navy blue.
From 2005 to 30 June 2011, the shirt sponsor was "Aeroport Castello", an airport. The current shirt sponsor is Pamesa, a ceramics company. From the 2016–17 season, the kit has been made by the Spanish company <a href="Joma">Joma</a>, having previously been produced by the Chinese company <a href="Xtep">Xtep</a> and <a href="Puma%20AG">Puma</a> of Germany, among others.

The <a href="mascot">mascot</a> (named "Groguet", "Little Yellow") is characterised as an <a href="anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> <a href="submarine">submarine</a>.

Cádiz CF

Cádiz Club de Fútbol, S.A.D., known simply as Cádiz, is a Spanish professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>.
Founded in 1910, the club competes in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, holding home games at <a href="Nuevo%20Mirandilla">Nuevo Mirandilla</a>, with a seating capacity of 20,724.
<a href="Salvadoran">Salvadoran</a> legend <a href="M%C3%A1gico%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Mágico González</a> played for the club during the 1980s and 1990s, and is widely recognized as the best player to ever play for the team.
Between 1929 and 1977, Cádiz played in either the second or third tier of Spanish football. In <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">1977</a>, Cádiz achieved promotion to La Liga for the first time. Since then Cádiz has played fourteen seasons in the first tier, as well as spending several at the second level.
History.
The first documented game of Cádiz CF was played against Cádiz Sporting Club on Thursday, 8 September 1910. Cádiz CF won it 1–0. Two days later on 10 September 1910, several Cádiz citizens appealed to Civil Government to register a club under the name Cádiz Foot-Ball Club. One of the founders was José Rivera y Lora, the first Cádiz president. A year later, in 1911, two other important events of Cádiz football took place: the foundation of the Español Foot-Ball Club and the inscription of Cádiz Foot-Ball Club to the Federación Sur (Southern Football Federation). The <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> interrupted the organization of competitions and Cádiz CF only played friendly matches, among others, against teams such as <a href="Real%20Betis">Betis</a> and <a href="RC%20Celta%20de%20Vigo">Celta de Vigo</a>.
Cádiz played the first complete season 1939–40 in Segunda División after the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The club finished 1st in the Group 5 with 11 wins in 14 games. That season the coach position was occupied by Santiago Núñez, who was also a player, and the key roles were played by Roldán, Díaz, Mateo, the goalkeeper Bueno, future Real Madrid player, and Camilo Liz, who decades later became the technical secretary of the club. During the following 3 seasons Cádiz was far away from repeating that success. Cádiz first reached <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> in <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20La%20Liga">1977–78</a>, after having spent two decades in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">second division</a>. It took place on 5 June 1977, with a 2–0 victory at Ramón de Carranza against <a href="Terrassa%20FC">Tarrasa</a>. Relegated after just one season, the club returned in 1980, managing a further 13-year stay. In August 1981, before returning to La Liga, Cádiz won its first <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20de%20Carranza%20Trophy">Ramón de Carranza Trophy</a>. They beat <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a> (led by coach <a href="Miguel%20Mu%C3%B1oz">Miguel Muñoz</a>) 1–0 with the goal scored by <a href="Dieguito%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201983%29">Dieguito</a>. Among them there were such important players in Cádiz history as Bocoya, Juan José, Hugo Vaca, Dos Santos, Amarillo, Luque, Linares, Pepe Mejías, Dieguito (Escobar), López (Choquet) and Mané.
Often led by the skills of <a href="El%20Salvador">Salvadoran</a> <a href="M%C3%A1gico%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Mágico González</a>, the club managed to maintain its top flight status in the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20La%20Liga">1990–91 season</a>, thanks to youth graduate <a href="Kiko%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201972%29">Kiko</a> (and 25 minutes of his inspiration against <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a>), who picked up the offensive burden after González left. During the late 1980s and early 1990s the club became known as "The Yellow Submarine", due to its capacity of "coming afloat" every year at the end of each season and remain in the top division, despite having been "sunk down" during most of the campaign.
However, in just two seasons, Cádiz dropped down two levels. In 1995 Cádiz was on the brink of extinction due to financial issues. The investment group no longer invested in the club and declared the suspension of payments. A group of cadistas, headed by Antonio Muñoz and Manuel García, had the negotiations with the creditors, reorganized the club and started managing it directly from the city of Cádiz. After a long spell in "<a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>" the club was finally promoted in 2003, spectacularly <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">returning to the top level in 2005</a>, after taking the championship with a last-day victory at neighbours <a href="Xerez%20CD">Xerez CD</a>. The match was played on 18 June 2005, and ended up with 2–0 Cádiz win in the presence of 8000 Cádiz fans, arrived in Xerez.
However, Cádiz was eventually relegated back to the second tier, in the 37th and penultimate matchday of <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20La%20Liga">2005–06</a>. Cádiz finished in the 19th position, 4 points away from 16th place, which could secure the club a place in La Liga. For the following campaign, former <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spanish international</a> <a href="Oliverio%20Jes%C3%BAs%20Alvarez%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Oli</a> took the reins of the team, being sacked after only a few months. With him the club won just 4 from 11 matches.
In June 2008, Cádiz dropped another level returning to the Segunda División B. However, after just <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">one season</a>, it managed to return to the second division, but was immediately relegated in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2009–10 campaign</a>. Cádiz finished in 19th place, falling just one point behind the teams in 17th and 18th positions, which guaranteed them a place in the Segunda División. Performance of such experienced players as <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20L%C3%B3pez%20Guti%C3%A9rrez">Raúl López</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Fleurquin">Andrés Fleurquin</a> and <a href="Enrique%20Ortiz%20%28Spanish%20footballer%29">Enrique Ortiz</a> was the major asset to the successful 2008–09 season. Cádiz became the champion of the Segunda División B, having a successful season with 24 wins, 7 draws, and 7 losses in 38 matches. 
During the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2015–16</a> the club finished its season in Group 4 in 4th place and qualified for the promotion playoffs, they beat <a href="Racing%20de%20Ferrol">Racing Ferrol</a>, <a href="Racing%20Santander">Racing Santander</a> and <a href="H%C3%A9rcules%20CF">Hércules</a> and therefore promoted back to Segunda División after 6 years. The key match against Hércules took place on 26 June 2016, at the <a href="Estadio%20Ram%C3%B3n%20de%20Carranza">Ramón de Carranza</a> stadium. Cádiz won it 1–0.
On 29 September 2019, Cádiz CF organized trials in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, India. For the second time, the club gave an opportunity to more than 250 Indian students to win a scholarship to live and train in Spain. As a result, three players were selected: Harshika Jain, Veer Gondal and Arnav Gorantala. Their stay in Spain began on January, 2020.
In the beginning of the 2019–20 season, Cádiz repeated its best start record as per first ten league games of a single season. This record dates 80 years back to the 1939–1940 season. Head coach <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Cervera">Álvaro Cervera</a> admitted the good start of the season and said:
On 28 December 2019, Manuel Vizcaíno Fernández was appointed as chairman of the board of directors for the next six years, along with the directors Jorge Cobo and Martín José García Marichal.
On 2 March 2020, Cádiz CF confirmed that an unnamed American investor of great economic strength became one of the club's shareholders. Despite acquiring a minority of shares, the investor's goal is expanding his presence in the club and helping the Andalusian club with the promotion to La Liga. The president of the club Manuel Vizcaíno revealed the plans of using new resources to modernize the infrastructure, facilities and other areas of the club.
On 12 July 2020, Cádiz CF was promoted back to the <a href="La%20Liga">Primera División</a> after 14 years. On 20 September 2020 Cádiz won its first La Liga match (2:0 away win over <a href="UD%20Huesca">Huesca</a>) since the previous campaign in the league. On 5 December, Cádiz CF won a home game for the first time in the season, setting another historic moment in the process: in fact, goals by <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Gim%C3%A9nez">Álvaro Giménez</a> and <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Negredo">Álvaro Negredo</a> secured a 2–1 final result against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. Plus, on 21 February 2021, they managed to block Barcelona once again, as the match ended up in a 1–1 draw: a penalty by substitute <a href="%C3%81lex%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Álex Fernández</a> equalized the initial opener by <a href="Lionel%20Messi">Lionel Messi</a> (also from the penalty spot).
On 4 April 2021 in a league game Mouctar Diakhaby of Valencia denounced an alleged racist aggression by Cádiz defender Juan Cala. The game was briefly halted after Valencia players walked off the pitch. The tests carried out by LaLiga and the RFEF showed that the complaint was false, so the judge declared Juan Cala innocent.
On 2 May 2021, Cádiz won 1–0 at Granada in Los Cármenes. With 40 points in the standings, Cádiz CF mathematically achieved survival in LaLiga Santander.

Its home matches has been played at the 14,708-capacity <a href="Campo%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20de%20Vallecas">Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas</a> stadium since 1976.

The club won the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2017–18 Segunda División</a>. By historical performance, Rayo is the third best club in Community of Madrid, after <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>.
History.
Establishment and early years.
Rayo Vallecano was founded on 29 May 1924 in the hometown of Prudencia Priego, wife of the club's first president Julián Huerta. Greatly inspired by <a href="Club%20Atl%C3%A9tico%20River%20Plate">River Plate</a> (a Football club from <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>), in 1949, after an agreement with <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>, a red diagonal stripe was added to the team's kit, and the club reached <a href="Tercera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Tercera División</a> for the first time in its history.
Yo-yo years.
One of the perennial yo-yo clubs of Spanish football, and always in the shadow of the two biggest clubs in the city (<a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20Madrid">Atlético Madrid</a>), Rayo Vallecano spent many years during the 1980s and 1990s moving back and forth between <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> and <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>. The 1983-84 season was the worst during the 1980s. The club finished in the last position in Segunda División and was relegated to Segunda División B.
Due to a tragedy Rayo Vallecano turned out to be <a href="Laurie%20Cunningham">Laurie Cunningham</a>'s last club; he was killed in a car crash just outside Madrid in 1989, after a sole season. He had recently won an <a href="F.A.%20Cup">F.A. Cup</a> winners medal with <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon F.C.</a> in England the previous year and had also represented neighbours Real Madrid for four years.
They appeared to have consolidated their top flight status after <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">gaining promotion in 1999</a>, and the team's most successful season came in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20La%20Liga">2000–01</a> when they <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20UEFA%20Cup">reached the quarter-finals</a> of the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a>, going out only to eventual runners-up <a href="Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s">Alavés</a>; Rayo finished ninth in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20La%20Liga">the previous campaign</a>, but entered the competition via the <a href="UEFA%20Fair%20Play%20ranking">fair play draw</a>.
2003–11: Segunda División and below.
However, the club shortly thereafter fell on hard times, enduring successive relegations in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20La%20Liga">2003</a> and <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2004</a>. For <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2005–06</a> manager <a href="M%C3%ADchel%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201963%29">Míchel</a>, a Real Madrid legend in the 1980s and '90s, was hired.
Rayo finished the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">2006–07 season</a> in second place in <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>, winning the <a href="2007%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">promotion play-off</a> semifinal but losing in the final to <a href="SD%20Eibar">Eibar</a> (1–2 aggregate). <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">The following campaign</a>, the team returned to division two after a four-year absence after a victorious run in <a href="2008%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B%20play-offs">the playoffs</a>, disposing of <a href="Benidorm%20CF">Benidorm</a> in the semi-final and <a href="Zamora%20CF">Zamora</a> in the last game 2–1 on aggregate.
In its first seasons back in the second tier of Spanish football, Rayo finished comfortably, often either in or just outside the promotion places. In <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2010–11</a>, the team ranked in second position and returned to the top flight after an eight-year absence, only trailing champions <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> in spite of very serious economic problems.
2011–: La Liga and Segunda División yo-yo.
In March 2014, <a href="Huawei">Huawei</a> agreed to sponsor Rayo Vallecano for two league matches against Real Madrid and <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a>.
In August 2015, Rayo Vallecano purchased the majority of <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20FC%20%28NASL%29">Oklahoma City FC</a>, a <a href="North%20American%20Soccer%20League%20%282011%E2%80%932017%29">NASL</a> expansion franchise which had yet to officially play a game renaming the club to <a href="Rayo%20OKC">Rayo OKC</a>, despite the stadium increasingly needing work. It was the first ever entry of a Spanish club into the American sports market and mirrored a 2013 sponsorship agreement with <a href="Qbao">Qbao</a> in terms of expanding the club's profile overseas. Rayo OKC folded after a year due to Rayo Vallecano's relegation from La Liga and a dispute between the co-owners led to less finance for the U.S. side.
In May 2016, Rayo Vallecano were relegated to the Segunda División, finishing 18th in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20La%20Liga">2015–16 La Liga</a> season. This ended their five-year streak in La Liga, their longest ever stay in the top-flight. Their first season back in the second division was a poor one, with both problems on the field and off, and they finished in 12th position. Rayo went through three managers in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2016–17 Segunda División</a> season before finally settling on club legend <a href="M%C3%ADchel%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201975%29">Míchel</a>. He revived the club from the relegation places to 12th, almost making the playoffs.
At the start of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">2017–18 Segunda División</a> season, the club appointed their recently retired goalkeeper <a href="David%20Cobe%C3%B1o">David Cobeño</a> as the sporting director of the club. They secured their promotion with a 1-0 over <a href="CD%20Lugo">CD Lugo</a> with one game remaining. That season the club won Segunda División with 76 points in 42 games.
On 20 March 2019, the club appointed <a href="Paco%20J%C3%A9mez">Paco Jémez</a> as head coach, and on 4 May, Rayo was relegated back to the Segunda División after losing 4–1 to <a href="Levante%20UD">Levante UD</a>, eventually finishing last
In August 2020, the club appointed <a href="Andoni%20Iraola">Andoni Iraola</a> as head coach. They finished sixth and won promotion in the playoffs against <a href="Girona%20FC">Girona FC</a>; despite losing the first leg at home 1–2, the team came back to win the second leg 2-0 away to claim a place in La Liga for <a href="2021%E2%80%9322%20La%20Liga">2021–22</a>. In February 2022, Iraola's side defeated <a href="RCD%20Mallorca">RCD Mallorca</a> to make the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey; it was the second time in club history and first since 1982. The club finished 12th in La Liga. This was a big achievement as they were by far the leagues smallest team, and most had predicted that they would be relegated.

Stadium.
<a href="Campo%20de%20F%C3%BAtbol%20de%20Vallecas">Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas</a> is a football stadium located on Calle Payaso Fofó 1, Vallecas. Opened on 10 May 1976, at first it was called "New Stadium Vallecas", but in January 2004, 13 years after the arrival of the Ruiz-Mateos family in 1991, it changed denominations, as the wife was also named by her husband, businessman <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Ruiz%20Mateos">José María</a>, the first woman president of an elite football team.
It has a capacity of 14,708 spectators in an all-seated format and dimensions of 100×67 m. after the enlargement of the width and the reduction of the length of the pitch after the remodelling of the grandstands, compulsory due to the elimination of the fences surrounding the pitch. The pitch is one the smallest in La Liga. Additionally, one of the goal ends does not have a grandstand, just a big wall with information panels.
In June 2009, the club announced plans for the construction of a new stadium. Nevertheless, the Autonomous Community of Madrid, owner of the stadium, has not any plan as far as it is known in 2023.
Club culture and supporters.
The fans do not have a good relationship with the current owner <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Mart%C3%ADn%20Presa">Raúl Martín Presa</a> and regularly chant for him to leave.
In late March 2012, in support of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Spanish%20protests">2011–12 Spanish protests</a>, the squad decided to take one day off from training to join the demonstrations. In 2014, 85-year-old <a href="Vallecas">Vallecas</a> resident Carmen Martínez Ayuso was evicted from her house after living there since the 1960s. Rayo Vallecano and particularly coach <a href="Paco%20%28footballer%29">Paco Jémez</a> were touched by her story, and subsequently offered to fund Martínez for the foreseeable future.
In February 2017, Ukrainian player <a href="Roman%20Zozulya">Roman Zozulya</a> left the club after one training session due to chants of "Nazi" by Rayo fans accusing him of belonging to far-right groups; Zozulya denied ever belonging to any far-right groups, and immediately returned to his parent club Real Betis. In 2019, when Zozulya was playing for <a href="Albacete%20Balompi%C3%A9">Albacete</a>, a match was called off at half-time after fans once again sang "Zozulya you are a Nazi".
Anthems and songs.
Although most people recognise the supporting songs by ska-punk band <a href="Ska-P">Ska-P</a> ("Rayo Vallecano" and "Como un rayo"), Rayo Vallecano has an official anthem which played at their home stadium before matches.
