Brescia Calcio

Italian association football club
Football club
Brescia Calcio, commonly referred to as Brescia (), is an Italian football club based in Brescia, Lombardy, that currently plays in Serie B, the second tier of Italian football.
The club holds the record for total number of seasons (64) and consecutive seasons (18, from 1947–48 to 1964–65) in Serie B, which they have won four times. Their best finish in Serie A came in the 2000–01 season when they placed eighth. At the beginning of the 21st century, led by the 1993 Ballon d'Or winner Roberto Baggio, the club also qualified for the Intertoto Cup twice, reaching the final in 2001 but being defeated on away goals by Paris Saint-Germain. During this era, Pep Guardiola, former FC Barcelona captain and later a highly decorated manager, also played for the club.
The team's colours are blue and white. Its stadium is the 19,550-seater Stadio Mario Rigamonti. They have a long-standing rivalry with Atalanta from nearby Bergamo.
History.
The team was founded in 1911 as Brescia Football Club, joining the "Terza Categoria" division the same year. In 1913, Brescia was promoted to First Division for the first time, and from 1929 they played in Serie A for six of the seven following seasons. Successively, the club played among the two top divisions until 1982, when Brescia was relegated to Serie C. The club then returned to Serie B in 1985. Brescia played outside the two divisions of Lega Calcio (Serie A and B) only four years; under this aspect, only 11 clubs in all Italy marked a better performance.
Brescia won the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1994, the biggest achievement in their history to date. Brescia actually came to the footballing forefront only in 2000, when the previously unfancied club signed former FIFA World Player of the Year Roberto Baggio, who led Brescia to a seventh-place finish in the 2000–01 season, thus qualifying for the UEFA Intertoto Cup. Successively, Brescia reached the Intertoto Cup finals, then lost to Paris Saint-Germain via the away goals rule after achieving a 0–0 away draw in the first leg and a 1–1 home draw in the second leg. Baggio spent four years at Brescia before retiring in 2004 and during those historic four years, Brescia became widely known as "Baggio's Brescia". During Baggio's four-year spell with Brescia, the club recorded its best-ever run of staying in Serie A. In the very next season that followed Baggio's retirement (2004–05), however, Brescia were relegated from Serie A on the last day, finishing a lowly 19th. Brescia struggled for returning to top flight after the relegation and finally returned to Serie A after beating Torino with a 2–1 aggregate in the 2009–10 season. In the 2010–11 season, however, they were relegated back to Serie B. In the 2014–15 season, they were relegated to Lega Pro after finishing second from last. However, after Parma's declaration of bankruptcy and demotion to Serie D, Brescia was among the teams selected to replace them in Serie B. A new promotion to Serie A was secured in the 2018–19 season, with two games to spare.
One of the most decorated managers of all time, Mircea Lucescu, the Romanian Gheorghe Hagi, striker Luca Toni, Barcelona icon Pep Guardiola, Brescian striker Mario Balotelli, defender Mario Rigamonti and playmaker Andrea Pirlo–– which were born in the province of Brescia–– have also spent time playing for the club.
Colours and badge.
The traditional home kit
Colours and kit.
The first Brescia kit in 1911 was blue (the national colour) with a thick white vertical stripe down the middle, a design which has returned for the centenary season in 2011. The first appearance of a white "V" was in 1927; added so that the team could use "Stadium", the newly built home of another team, Virtus. This style remained until 1940 when the "V" was removed and a plain blue shirt was used.
Some substantial changes after World War II saw the shirt become plain white with blue shorts. This was short-lived and, in 1954, the plain blue shirt returned. The white "V" also returned eventually in 1961 as a show of goodwill by the new chairman at the time.
The "V" disappeared again in 1969; replaced by a diagonal white sash, and returned, but much smaller, in 1974 for two years. The "V" was situated over the heart with the inclusion of the lioness, the symbol of the city of Brescia. The shirt remained plain blue until 1991, when the "V" returned and has been used ever since.
Badge.
The first badge appeared on Brescia kits in the 1980s; a blue crest with a golden outline featuring a lion. The city of Brescia is known as "Leonessa d'Italia" (the Lioness of Italy) after ten days of popular uprising that took place in the city in the spring of 1849 against Austrian rule.
The crest was changed for the centenary of Brescia Calcio in 2011, featuring higher visibility, leaves, and a substantial redesign of the old logo.
The thick profile of the gold shield and laurel branches surrounding the badge are in pure celebration of achieving 100 years of age. The lettering has changed in favour of a font in the style of the period when the team was founded.
The Lion that, due to a misunderstanding of history, many believe to be a lioness (the definition of "Leonessa d'Italia" was assigned to Brescia following the uprisings, but the lion as a symbol of Brescia dates back to the Republic of Venice), has undergone a total redesign which aims to fix some errors in heraldic iconography (the absence of nails, muscle weakness and weak curvature of the tail) and to restore a more toned and ferocious looking lion, the symbol a football team should have.
Stadium.
The first ground at which football was played in Brescia was Campo Fiera, where the English workers at the Tempini plant played on their breaks.
In 1911, in the wake of enthusiasm following the foundation of the new club, it is thought a fenced ground was built shortly after on Via Milano.
In 1920 came the opening of the new ground on Via Cesare Lombroso, Brescia, which was used by the team until 1923. From 1923 until 1959, the team had moved into a more modern and larger facility located at Porta Venezia (then Via Naviglio), built for the town's sports club Virtus and called "Stadium".
It was in 1956 that the municipality had the idea to move the club to a stadium more suited to host the matches of the new Serie B.
They began the renovation and construction of the stands to the existing ground at Via Giovanni Novagani. This was completed in 1959 and Brescia began to play their home games in the new Mario Rigamonti stadium (named after the Torino player, Mario Rigamonti, who died in the Superga air disaster).
Over the years, the stadium has undergone several refurbishments (construction of roofing, press room, etc.), the most significant of which was in 2007 with the installation of new security measures.

Cagliari Calcio

Italian association football club
Football club
Cagliari Calcio, commonly referred to as Cagliari (), is an Italian football club based in Cagliari, Sardinia. In the 2023–24 season, they compete in Serie A. The team are temporarily playing their home games at the 16,416-seat Unipol Domus, the temporary stadium built privately in 2017 in 4 months, adjacent to their future new stadium site.
Founded in 1920, they won their first and only "Scudetto" in 1969–70, when they were led by the Italian national team's all-time leading scorer, Gigi Riva. The triumph was also the first by a club from south of Rome. The club's best European performance was in the 1993–94 UEFA Cup, reaching the semi-finals before losing to eventual winners Internazionale.
As with the flag of its city, Cagliari's colours are blue and red. The club badge incorporates the flag of Sardinia.
History.
Before Serie A.
Cagliari became the first ever out-right champions of Serie C during the 1951–52 season; prior to that in the league, the championship was shared amongst more than one team. They spent the 1950s from then on in Serie B, losing a promotion play-off in 1954. After descending to Serie C in the early 1960s, Cagliari's rise would be meteoric, eventually achieving promotion to Serie A in 1964.
First Serie A adventure: 1964–1976.
The squad for the "Rossoblu"'s debut season in Serie A featured players like defender Mario Martiradonna, midfielders Pierluigi Cera, Nené and Ricciotti Greatti, and forward Gigi Riva. A poor first half of the season, however, saw Cagliari in last place with nine points at the halfway mark. An astonishing second half of the season saw Cagliari defeat the likes of Juventus and Milan and finish in seventh place with 34 points. Two seasons later, Riva finished as Serie A's top scorer for the first time while Cagliari finished with the league's best defensive record.
During the summer of 1967, Cagliari played a season in North America as part of a fledgling league called the United Soccer Association. This league included teams from Europe and South America set to play in American and Canadian cities, with each club bearing a local name. Cagliari played as the Chicago Mustangs, and finished joint second in the league's Western Division with 13 points, two behind the division champion and eventual league champion Los Angeles Wolves. The league's leading scorer was Chicago/Cagliari's Roberto Boninsegna, who scored ten goals while playing in 9 of the team's 12 games.
Cagliari first emerged as serious Serie A title contenders in 1968–69 with a three-horse race involving them, Fiorentina and Milan. Fiorentina would win the league, but the following season would bring ultimate glory. With Angelo Domenghini joining the side, Cagliari would win the title in 1970 with only two games lost, 11 goals conceded (the fewest in any major European league to date) and Riva as league top scorer once more. Players like Albertosi, Niccolai, Boninsegna, Gori, Cera, Domenghini and Riva played in Italy's 1970 World Cup final team.
The 1970s would see a gradual decline (though were title contenders two years after their one and only "Scudetto" win). Cagliari were finally relegated in 1976, with Riva's career having effectively ended during that season.
Up and down again: 1976–87.
After relegation, Cagliari lost a play-off for promotion the following season and would return to Serie A in 1979. Players like Franco Selvaggi, Mario Brugnera (a survivor of the 1970 team) and Alberto Marchetti ensured a respectable four-year stay in the top flight before a second relegation in 1983. The 1980s would then prove to be a darker time compared to the previous two decades with relegation to Serie C1 in 1987.
There and back: 1987–2000.
Cagliari spent two seasons in Serie C1. In the first one it barely avoided relegation in Serie C2. In 1988, Claudio Ranieri was appointed coach, and led the team to two successive promotions, to Serie B in 1989 and to Serie A in 1990. The first two seasons back in Serie A saw Cagliari fight relegation, with safety being achieved by excellent second half runs. But the 1992–93 season would see Cagliari fight for a European place and succeed under the management of Carlo Mazzone. The following season saw a best-ever run to the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, taking out Juventus in the quarter-finals before being eliminated 5–3 on aggregate by compatriots Internazionale, having won the first leg 3–2 at home.
The next few years would see Cagliari return to mid-table anonymity, before a struggle in 1996–97 saw Cagliari relegated after losing a play-off to Piacenza. Once more they bounced back after just one year, but their next stay in Serie A lasted just two seasons.
Once and again: 2000 onwards.
Cagliari spent the next four seasons in Serie B, until in 2003–04 with Sardinian-born veteran striker Gianfranco Zola, the team won promotion. In 2005–06, the first season without Zola, the team changed their manager three times before Nedo Sonetti, appointed in November, was able to save the team from relegation, especially thanks to the excellent goal contribution from Honduran striker David Suazo.
Apart from finishing 9th in 2008–09 season, Cagliari regularly finished in the bottom half of Serie A under a sequence of managers, before being relegated in 2014–15. They gained promotion back the following season as champions of Serie B.
In 2014, the company passed, after 22 years of Massimo Cellino's presidency, into the hands of Tommaso Giulini, president and owner of Fluorsid, a multinational in the chemical sector. Relegation took place in the first season, but the team won the Serie B championship in 2016, returning permanently to the top division, albeit always finishing in the second half of the table. Cagliari was relegated at the end of the 2021–22 season. They reappointed Claudio Ranieri halfway through the 2022–23 season with the club in fourteenth place. Under Ranieri's management, Cagliari won the 2022–23 Serie B playoffs.
Stadium.
Cagliari moved from the Stadio Amsicora to the Stadio Sant'Elia in 1970, after winning their only league title. It was renovated for Italy's hosting of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, when it hosted all of England's group games, ostensibly to confine the team's notorious hooligans to an island.
Disputes with the city council over renovation of the publicly owned stadium meant that Cagliari played their final home games of 2011–12 at the Stadio Nereo Rocco in Trieste on the Italian mainland. For most of the following season, the club played at the Stadio Is Arenas in the neighbouring municipality of Quartu Sant'Elena. It was deemed unsafe by the league, forcing them to play behind closed doors before leaving the ground in April 2013. The Sant'Elia was demolished for a new stadium in 2017, and the club moved to the temporary Sardegna Arena next to it.
Colours, badge and nicknames.
The official red and blue colours of Cagliari mirror those featured on the "stemma" of Cagliari. The red parts of the stemma are a reference to the coat of arms of the House of Savoy, a family which was previously the monarchy of Italy and more relevantly to Cagliari in particular, the Kingdom of Sardinia. The blue part of the "stemma" features the sky and the sea, also a castle; this is because the old historic centre of Cagliari is walled and called the "Castello". Due to the use of these colours on their shirt in halves, the club is commonly nicknamed "rossoblu".
Cagliari have had several different logo designs during their history, all of which feature the flag of Sardinia. Usually the badge also features the club colours; if there is a change, the main difference has been the colour of the border or the shape. Since June 2015, the badge features an "Old French"-shaped escutcheon with red and blue halves, with the club's name written in white just above the flag of Sardinia. The Moors' heads have, for the first time, been turned to the right as of 2015 so as to match the Sardinian flag after it was updated in 1992.
Due to the fact that Cagliari are the main club from the island of Sardinia, they are nicknamed the "Isolani" ("Islanders").

SSC Napoli

Italian association football club based in Naples
Football club
Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli, commonly referred to as Napoli (), is an Italian professional football club based in the city of Naples that plays in Serie A, the top flight of Italian football. They are the reigning champions in Italy, having won the Serie A title in the 2022–23 season. In its history, Napoli has won three Serie A titles, six Coppa Italia titles, two Supercoppa Italiana titles, and one UEFA Cup.
The club was formed in 1926 as Associazione Calcio Napoli following the merger of US Internazionale Napoli and Naples Foot-Ball Club. Napoli saw relatively little success in its early years, winning their first major trophy in the 1962 Coppa Italia. Napoli then saw increased success in the late 1970s (including their second Coppa Italia in 1976) and especially in the 1980s, after the club acquired Diego Maradona in 1984. During his time in Naples, Maradona helped the team win several trophies, which led to the club retiring his number 10 jersey. During this period, Napoli won two league titles (in 1987 and 1990), the 1987 Coppa Italia, the 1990 Supercoppa Italiana, and their only European trophy with the 1989 UEFA Cup. Following his departure, however, Napoli struggled financially, and endured several relegations and a bankruptcy, prior to being re-founded in 2004 by film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis. Under his leadership, the club has stabilized, which has led to renewed on-field success, winning 2005–06 Serie C1, the 2012, 2014, and 2020 Coppa Italia titles, and the 2014 Supercoppa Italiana, eventually culminating in their third league title in 2023, the first since Maradona's departure.
By attendance, Napoli have the fourth-largest fan base in Italy, and were ranked as the fifth highest-earning football club in Serie A, with $182 million in revenue during the 2017–18 season. In 2018, Forbes estimated the club is the fifth most valuable club in Italy, worth $379 million. Napoli are also one of the associate members of the European Club Association.
Since 1959, the club has played their home games at the Stadio San Paolo, which was renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona after the Argentine striker's death in 2020. Napoli traditionally wear sky blue shirts, white shorts, and sky blue socks at home and white shirts, white or sky blue shorts, and white or sky blue socks away; this is derived from the shirts of Naples FBC and the shorts of Internazionale Napoli after the clubs merged to form Napoli's predecessor Internaples in 1922. Napoli have rivalries with Juventus, Roma, Inter Milan and AC Milan. The club's anthem is "'O surdato 'nnammurato", one of the most famous songs in the Neapolitan language.
History.
Origins.
Although the club was officially founded in 1926, Napoli traces its roots to the first relevant Neapolitan club, founded as Naples Foot-Ball &amp; Croquet Club in 1905 by English sailor William Poths and his associate Hector M. Bayon. Neapolitans such as Conforti, Catterina and Amedeo Salsi were also involved; Salsi was named the club's first president. The original kit of the club was a sky blue and navy blue striped shirt, with black shorts. Naples' first match was a 3–2 win against the English crew of the boat "Arabik" with goals from William MacPherson, Michele Scafoglio and Léon Chaudoir.
Early into its existence, the Italian Football Championship was limited to just northern clubs, so southern clubs competed against sailors or in cups such as Thomas Lipton's Lipton Challenge Cup. In the cup competed between Naples FBC and Palermo FBC Naples won three finals. The foreign contingent at the club broke off in 1911 to form Internazionale Napoli, who wore blue shirts with white shorts, in time for both club's debut in the Italian Championship of 1912–13. Each of the teams won a Prima Categoria southern Italian title and therefore competed in the national semifinal, Naples doing so in 1912–13 and Internazionale Napoli in 1913–14. They were set to face each other for the southern title again in 1914–15 but it was cancelled due to World War I.
Due to financial pressure, the two rival clubs merged as the Foot-Ball Club Internazionale-Naples, abbreviated as FBC Internaples on 2 October 1922. Internaples', and later Napoli's kits are derived from those of Naples FBC and Internazionale Napoli; adopting the sky blue from Naples' shirts and the white shorts from Internazionale Napoli.
FBC Internaples.
The merged club was seen by some media and fans to be a continuation of Internazionale Napoli rather than a new club; it played its games at Internazionale Napoli's Terme di Agnano rather than Naples FBC's Campo del Poligono and kept Internazionale Napoli's nickname of "Gli Azzurri" (The Blues) rather than "I Blucelesti" (The Navy Blue and Sky Blues) used by Naples. Internaples were also given the nickname "I Puledri" (the foals), as the horse is a symbol of Naples.
Internaples were immediately enrolled in the top-flight Prima Divisione Lega Sud championship, as both Internazionale Napoli and Naples competed in that division pre-merger. Since the end of World War I both clubs had lost dominance of the region to the likes of Puteolana and Savoia. Even with the combined strength of Internaples, Savoia still proved to be the top team in southern Italy. Internaples reached the interregional semi-final of Lega Sud in each of its first two seasons, and reached the Lega Sud final in 1925–26. This secured the club a spot in the new Divisione Nazionale for the following season.
The birth of Associazione Calcio Napoli.
Under the presidency of Giorgio Ascarelli, and likely under pressure from the new fascist government to "Italianize" the club name, Internaples changed its name to Associazione Calcio Napoli on 25 August 1926. The newly renamed team also moved from the Terme di Agnano to a new stadium, the Stadio Militare dell'Arenaccia. After a poor start, with a sole point in an entire championship, Napoli was re-admitted to Serie A's forerunner, the Divisione Nazionale, by the Italian Football Federation ("FIGC"), and began to improve thanks in part to Paraguayan-born Attila Sallustro, who was the first fully fledged hero to the fans. He was a capable goal-scorer and eventually set the all-time goal-scoring record for Napoli, which was later surpassed by players like Diego Maradona and Marek Hamšík.
Napoli entered the Serie A era under the management of William Garbutt. During Garbutt's six-year stint, the club would be dramatically transformed, frequently finishing in the top half of the table. This included two third-place finishes during the 1932–33 and 1933–34 seasons, with added notables such as Antonio Vojak, Arnaldo Sentimenti and Carlo Buscaglia. However, in the years leading up to World War II, Napoli went into decline, only surviving relegation in 1939–40 by goal average.
Napoli lost a closely contested relegation battle at the end of 1942 and were relegated to Serie B. They moved from the Stadio Giorgio Ascarelli to the Stadio Arturo Collana and remained in Serie B until after the war.
Post-war era and first trophies.
Play restarted in 1945 with two divisions: one consisting of Serie A teams from the north and one combined division of Serie A and Serie B teams from the central and south, with the top four of each division advancing to the national round that followed. Napoli won the Centro-Sud Serie A-B to secure a place in the Divisione Nazionale (where they placed fifth) and automatic promotion to the next season's Serie A. They were relegated after two seasons for a bribery scandal. The club won the Serie B title that season to ensure top flight football at the start of the 1950s. Napoli moved to their new home ground Stadio San Paolo in 1959.
Despite erratic league form with highs and lows during this period, including multiple relegations and promotions, Napoli won their first major trophy when they beat SPAL to lift the Coppa Italia in 1962, with goals from Gianni Corelli and Pierluigi Ronzon. The victory made Napoli the first team to win the Coppa while in Serie B, and they were promoted to Serie A that season. Their fourth relegation cut celebrations short the following season.
Name change.
As the club changed their name to Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli on 25 June 1964 they began to rise up again, gaining promotion in 1964–65. Under the management of former player Bruno Pesaola, they won the Coppa delle Alpi and were back among the elite in Serie A, with consistent top-five finishes. Napoli came very close to winning the league in 1967–68, finishing just behind Milan in second place. Some of the most popular players from this period were Dino Zoff, José Altafini, Omar Sívori and hometown midfielder Antonio Juliano. Juliano would eventually break the appearance records, which still stands today.
League stability and second Coppa Italia.
The trend of Napoli performing well in the league continued into the 1970s, with third place spots in 1970–71 and 1973–74. Under the coaching of former player Luís Vinício, this gained them entry into the early UEFA Cup competitions. In 1974–75, they reached the third round knocking out Porto 2–0 "en route". During the same season, Napoli finished second in Serie A, just two points behind champions Juventus. Solid performances from locally born players such as Giuseppe Bruscolotti, Antonio Juliano and Salvatore Esposito were relied upon during this period, coupled with goals from Giuseppe Savoldi.
The club won their second Coppa Italia trophy in 1975–76, eliminating Milan and Fiorentina "en route", before beating rivals Hellas Verona 4–0 in the final. That season, they also defeated Southampton 4–1 on aggregate to lift the 1976 Anglo-Italian League Cup. Napoli were entered into the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup for 1976–77, where they reached the semi-finals, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Anderlecht. In the Italian league, Napoli were still very much a consistent top six side for much of the late 1970s. Even into the earliest two seasons of the 1980s, the club were performing respectably with a third-place finish in 1980–81. Napoli's Primavera squad was also doing well at the time, winning the Torneo di Viareggio Cup in 1975 and their only Campionato Nazionale Primavera title in 1979. However, by 1983, they had slipped dramatically and were involved in relegation battles.
Napoli on the rise: Maradona era.
Napoli broke the world transfer record fee after acquiring Diego Maradona in a €12 million deal from Barcelona on 30 June 1984. The squad was gradually re-built, with the likes of Ciro Ferrara, Salvatore Bagni and Fernando De Napoli filling the ranks. The rise up the tables was gradual, by 1985–86, they had a third-place finish under their belts, but better was yet to come. With the attacking trio of Maradona, Bruno Giordano, and Careca (nicknamed MaGiCa), the 1986–87 season was the landmark in Napoli's history, becoming just the third Italian team to win the double after securing the Serie A title by three points and then beating Atalanta 4–0 to lift the Coppa Italia.
Because a mainland Southern Italian team had never won the league before, this turned Maradona into a cultural, social and borderline religious icon for Neapolitans, which stretched beyond the realms of just football.
The club were unsuccessful in the European Cup in the following season and finished runners-up in Serie A. However, Napoli were entered into the UEFA Cup for 1988–89 and won their first major European title. Juventus, Bayern Munich and PAOK were defeated "en route" to the final, where Napoli beat VfB Stuttgart 5–4 on aggregate, with two goals from Careca and one each from Maradona, Ferrara and Alemão.
Napoli added their second Serie A title in 1989–90, defeating Milan by two points in the title race. However, this was surrounded by less auspicious circumstances as Napoli were awarded two points for a game, when in Bergamo, an Atalanta fan threw a 100 lira coin at Alemão's head.
A controversial set of events set off at the 1990 World Cup, when Maradona made comments pertaining to North–South inequality in the country and the "risorgimento", asking Neapolitans to root for Argentina in the semi-finals against Italy in Naples.
The Stadio San Paolo was the only stadium during the competition where the Argentine national anthem was not jeered, Maradona bowed to the Napoli fans at the end and his country went on to reach the final. However, after the final, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) forced Maradona to take a doping test, which he failed testing positive for cocaine; both Maradona and Napoli staff later claimed it was a revenge plot for events at the World Cup. Maradona was banned for 15 months and would never play for the club again. The club still won the Supercoppa Italiana that year, with a record 5–1 victory against Juventus, but it would be their last major trophy for 22 years. In the European Cup, they were eliminated in the second round.
Decline.
Though the club finished fourth during the 1991–92 season, Napoli gradually went into decline after that season, both financially and on the field. Players such as Gianfranco Zola, Daniel Fonseca, Ciro Ferrara and Careca had all departed by 1994. Nonetheless, Napoli qualified for the 1994–95 UEFA Cup, reaching the third round and in 1996–97, Napoli appeared at the Coppa Italia final, but lost 3–1 to Vicenza; Napoli's primavera squad won the Coppa Italia Primavera that season. Napoli's league form had dropped lower, and relegation to Serie B came at the end of 1997–98 when they won only two matches all season.
The club returned to Serie A after gaining promotion in the 1999–2000 season, though after a closely contested relegation battle, they were relegated immediately back down the following season. By August 2004, Napoli was declared bankrupt. To secure football in the city, film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis re-founded the club under the name Napoli Soccer, as they were not allowed to use their old name until the next season. FIGC placed Napoli in Serie C1, where they missed out on promotion after losing 2–1 in play-offs to local rivals Avellino in 2004–05.
Despite the fact Napoli were playing in a low division, they retained higher average attendances than most of the Serie A clubs, breaking the Serie C attendance record with 51,000 at one match. 
Resurgence.
The following season, they secured promotion to Serie B and De Laurentiis brought back the club's history, restoring its name to Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli in May 2006. After just one season in Serie B, they were promoted to the top division, along with fellow "sleeping giants" Genoa. In 2010, under manager Walter Mazzarri, Napoli finished in sixth place to qualify for a 2010–11 UEFA Europa League spot. Napoli finished third in the 2010–11 season, qualifying directly for the group stage of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League.
In the 2011–12 season, Napoli ended in fifth place in Serie A, but defeated unbeaten champions Juventus at the Stadio Olimpico to win the Coppa Italia for the fourth time in the club's history, 25 years after their last cup win. The team finished second in its group of the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League, progressing to the round of 16, where they were eliminated by eventual winners Chelsea. In 2012–13, Napoli finished in second place in Serie A, the club's best performance since winning the 1989–90 Scudetto. Edinson Cavani finished as top scorer in the division with 29 goals, which resulted in him being sold to Paris Saint-Germain for a club-record fee of €64 million.
In the 2013 close-season, Mazzarri left Napoli and Rafael Benítez became the club's manager. They finished the 2013–14 season by winning the 2014 Coppa Italia Final, their fifth title in the tournament, with a 3–1 win against Fiorentina, as well as qualifying for the Champions League, but missed out on the group stage as they lost to Athletic Bilbao in the play-off round. Their subsequent run in the Europa League ended when they lost 2–1 on aggregate to FC Dnipro in the semi-finals. They finished the 2014–15 season in fifth, with Benítez then leaving for Real Madrid and being replaced by Maurizio Sarri.
In Sarri's first season in charge in the 2015–16 season, Napoli finished in 2nd place on 82 points and were knocked out of the Europa League in the round of 32 against Villarreal. In the following season, Napoli finished in 3rd place on 86 points and were knocked out of the Champions League in the round of 16 against Real Madrid. This year saw the breakout season for Dries Mertens who scored 34 goals in all competitions after he was moved from the left-wing to centre-forward following Milik's torn Anterior cruciate ligament.
In the 2017–18 season, Napoli challenged for the title for the entire season, and finished with a club record of 91 points. However, the title ultimately went to Juventus in the penultimate round of matches. On 23 December 2017, Marek Hamšík overtook Diego Maradona as Napoli's all-time leading scorer after scoring his 115th goal. At the end of the season, Sarri left for Chelsea, succeeded by Carlo Ancelotti in May 2018. He managed the club to another second-place finish, but was sacked on 10 December 2019, following a poor run of results in the 2019–20 season which left them seventh in the table. Gennaro Gattuso was named head coach the next day. On 14 June 2020, Dries Mertens became Napoli's all-time top scorer after scoring his 122nd goal in a Coppa Italia semi-final match against Inter. Napoli went on to win the 2019–20 Coppa Italia in a penalty shoot-out against Juventus in the final.
In December 2020, Napoli renamed San Paolo after Diego Maradona, after the passing away of their beloved club icon. Napoli finished fifth in Serie A that season after a draw on the final day, missing a Champions League berth by one point.
In the 2021–22 season, Luciano Spalletti replaced Gennaro Gattuso as head coach and led the team to the third place in Serie A, securing a Champions League spot for the azzurri after a two-years absence.
In the 2022–23 season, Napoli clinched the Serie A title for the first time since the 1989–90 season, and their third title overall, following a 1–1 draw against Udinese on 4 May 2023, their first time as titleholders since the days of Diego Maradona. Meanwhile, in the concurrent Champions League season, Spalletti led them into the quarter finals for the first time in their European history, where they were beaten 2–1 (1–0 on the road and 1–1 at home) by fellow Serie A side Milan.

Retired numbers.
&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Football squad player/styles.css" /&gt;
In the summer of 2000, Napoli retired the jersey number 10 belonged to former club legend Diego Maradona, who played for the club from 1984 to 1991. In order, the last players to wear number 10 were Fausto Pizzi (1995–1996), Beto (in 1996–1997), Igor Protti in 1997–1998 was the last player to play and score a goal with the number 10 shirt in Serie A and Claudio Bellucci in 1998–1999 and 1999–2000 in Serie B. Karl Corneliusson wore the number 10 shirt in 2004–2005 in Serie C. In Serie C the starting players had to wear shirts with the number 1-11.
However, for regulatory reasons, the number was reissued on blue shirts 2004 to 2006 Serie C1, a tournament utilizing the old numbering from 1 to 11. The last player to wear and score goals with this shirt in an official match was Mariano Bogliacino in the home match of 18 May 2006 against Spezia, valid for the final leg of the Supercoppa di Lega Serie C1; primacy belongs to him also for last appearance in the championship, 12 May 2006 at the home match against Lanciano. As regards exclusively the championship, however, the honour goes to the Argentine footballer Roberto Sosa, the distinction of being the last to wear the 10 at the San Paolo and at the same time to score in the match against Frosinone on 30 April 2006.
Culture.
Colours, badge and nicknames.
As Naples is a coastal city, the colours of the club have always been derived from the blue waters of the Gulf of Naples. Originally, while using the name "Naples FBC", the colours of the club implemented two shades of blue. However, since the 1920s, a singular blue tone has been used in the form of azure. Thus, Napoli share the nickname ""Azzurri" with the Italy national team. The shade of blue has been sky blue in many instances.
Napoli typically wear azure shirts with white shorts at home and white shirts with either white or blue shorts away, though in recent years the away kits have often deviated from this tradition.
One of the nicknames of Napoli is "I ciucci"", which means "the donkeys" in the Neapolitan language. Napoli were given this name after a particularly poor performance during the 1926–27 season. It was originally meant to be derogatory, as the Neapolitan symbol is a rampant black horse, but the club adopted the donkey as a mascot named ""'O Ciuccio"".
Napoli's first badge featured a rampant horse on top of a football with the letters "ACN" around it. The current club badge features a large "N" placed within a circle. This crest can be traced back to Internazionale Napoli, which used a similar design on their shirts. Since the club officially adopted the "N badge" as its representative, Napoli have altered it slightly at various times; sometimes it features the club's name around it, sometimes it does not. The main difference between each badge is the shade of blue used. Usually the "N" is white, although it has occasionally been gold (especially prior to 1980).
"Partenopei" is a popular nickname for the club and people from the city of Naples in general. It is derived from Greek mythology where the siren Parthenope tried to enchant Odysseus from his ship to Capri. In the story, Odysseus had his men tie him to the ship's mast so he was able to resist the song of the siren. Consequently, Parthenope, unable to live with the rejection of her love, drowned herself and her body was washed up upon the shore of Naples.
Supporters and rivalries.
Support.
Napoli is the fourth most supported football club in Italy with around 13% of Italian football fans supporting the club. Like other top clubs in the country, Napoli's fanbase goes beyond the Italian border; in 2018, the society announced that the team had over 35 million supporters worldwide and 120 million people who liked to watch Napoli matches.
The main ultra groups of Napoli are "Fedayn EAM 1979", "Ultras Napoli", "Fossato Flegreo", "Secco Vive", "Mastiffs", "Brigata Carolina", "Teste Matte", "Sud1996", "Nuova Guardia", "Vecchi Lions" and "Masseria".
Napoli fans have occasionally cheered loud enough to register as earthquakes on seismographs at University of Naples Federico II.{
Rivalries.
Unlike other Italian cities such as Genoa, Milan, Rome and Turin, Napoli is the only major football club in the city, and therefore there is no derby in the strict sense of the term. The now-infrequent derby with Savoia, the next largest club in Naples, was played for the first time 24 December 1939, during the knockout phase of the 1939–40 Coppa Italia, the score was 1–3 in favor of Napoli. The last meeting between the clubs was in Serie B in 2000, won 0–1 by Napoli. 
Napoli's most hated rivals are AS Roma, known as the Derby del Sole (Derby of the Sun), and the principal northern team Juventus. As Napoli is the most important southern Italian team, there are a lot of rivalries with several northern teams, like Milan, Internazionale, Atalanta and Hellas Verona They also have a rivalry with the other Roman club Lazio, and contest the Derby Mezzogiorno (Midday Derby/Derby of Southern Italy) against Bari and Derby Bourbon (referencing the family that ruled the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies) against Foggia.
The Derby del Sud Italia (Derby of Southern Italy) against Catanzaro was considered one of the most important rivalries in Italy during the 1970s.
The fans of Napoli do co-star in two particular derbies in Italy against other regional teams: Derby della Campania generally refers to a rivalry with regional clubs, mainly Avellino and Salernitana.
Friendships.
A "friendly rivalry" with Palermo is contested, known as the Derby delle Due Sicilie (Derby of the Two Sicilies), in reference to the historical link of the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies. Another friendly rivalry exists with Catania known as the Derby del Vulcano (Volcano Derby), referencing Mount Vesuvius near Naples and Mount Etna near Catania.
Friendships with teams outside Italy exist Borussia Dortmund, Celtic, and Lokomotiv Plovdiv, among others.
Napoli formerly had a famous and long-standing friendship with the fans of Genoa, but the friendship ended in 2019. Napoli also once had a friendship with Roma.
Finances.
S.S.C. Napoli was expelled from the professional league in 2004. Thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., the sports title was transferred to Napoli Soccer (later the "new" Napoli) in the same year, while the corporate entity which administered the "old" Napoli was liquidated. In the second last season before bankruptcy, the club was partially saved by the non-standard accounting practice of amortization after Silvio Berlusconi, owner of Milan and Prime Minister of Italy, introduced Italian Law 91/1981, Article 18B.
Since re-foundation in 2004, the club's large numbers of supporters provided the main source of income, particularly through gate revenues and TV rights. Napoli made an aggregate profit in 2006–07 Serie B. They have continued to be profitable since returning to Serie A. Napoli equity in 2005 was a negative €261,466, having started from €3 million capital. By 2010 the equity was at €25,107,223 and Napoli achieved self-sustainability.

Diego Maradona finished the season of Serie A as the league's top scorer, known in Italy as the "Capocannoniere", in the 1987–88 season with 15 goals. This achievement was matched by Edinson Cavani in 2012–13, Gonzalo Higuaín in 2015–16, and Victor Osimhen in 2022-23.
The record for most goals in a single league season belongs to Gonzalo Higuaín, with 36 in the 2015–16 Serie A.
The biggest ever victory recorded by Napoli was 8–1 against Pro Patria, in the 1955–56 season of Serie A. Napoli's heaviest championship defeat came during the 1927–28 season when eventual champions Torino beat them 11–0.
On 26 July 2016, Gonzalo Higuaín became the third-highest football transfer of all-time and highest ever transfer for an Italian club when he joined Juventus for €90 million.
On 31 July 2020, Napoli confirmed the signing of Victor Osimhen from Lille for a transfer fee of €70 million, making him Napoli's most expensive signing.

US Lecce

Football club in Lecce, Italy
Football club
Unione Sportiva Lecce, commonly referred to as Lecce (), is an association football club in Lecce, Apulia, Italy. The club play in Serie A in the 2023–24 season, the top level of the Italian football pyramid. Lecce plays its home games at Stadio Via del Mare, which has a capacity of 31,533 spectators.
The club was formed in 1927 upon an idea of 1908 and has spent a large part of their recent history bouncing between Serie B and Serie A, where the team debuted in the 1985–86 season. Its best Serie A finish is the ninth place obtained in the 1988–89 season. The club is 27th in the Serie A all-time table and is the second club from Apulia with appearances in the first two tiers of Italian football, with 16 Serie A seasons and 29 Serie B seasons.
Lecce won a Serie B title in 2022 and 2010, a Coppa Italia Serie C in 1975 and an Anglo-Italian Cup Semi-professionals in 1976.
Lecce players and fans are nicknamed "salentini" or simply "giallorossi" or "lupi".
History.
Lecce was founded as Sporting Club Lecce on 15 March 1908, initially including football, track-and-field and cycling sports. The first club president was Francesco Marangi. The first colours worn by Lecce during this time were black and white stripes, known in Italy as "bianconeri".
In its formative years, Lecce played in mostly regional leagues and competitions. During the 1923–24 season, the club dissolved before returning on 16 September 1927 as Unione Sportiva Lecce. The club was still wearing black and white stripes (similar to Juventus's kit) at this point, and the first president under the name Unione Sportiva Lecce was Luigi López y Rojo.
League: Early years 1930s, 40s and 50s.
Taranto Sport played Lecce in a game for promotion to Serie B from the local Southern Italian league; Lecce were victorious winning 3–2 after extra time. They were entered into Serie B for the 1929–30 season. The first game match played in the league was against Novara on 6 October 1929, a 2–1 victory. Lecce would eventually finish 13th. However, for the second time in the club's history, it ceased activity at the end of the 1931–32 season.
Four years later, Lecce returned and competed Serie C, finishing 11th in their return season. Around this time, the club was in turmoil: the following season they withdrew from Serie C after four days, and then during the 1938–39 season, they finished in third place but were moved down to 12th after it was revealed the club had violated the league's federal regulations.
The club finished in first place during the 1943–44 season, but club football was then suspended due to World War II. Nonetheless, when club football resumed, Lecce finished as champions of Serie C, gaining promotion back into Serie B. Two decent seasons followed (finishing fourth and third in respective seasons), with star player Silvestri scoring 20 goals in one season, before the club was relegated.
Lecce stayed down in Serie C for six seasons during this period, though this was not a particularly successful time for the club. Striker Anselmo Bislenghi scored 83 goals for the club during this period, thus becoming a hero. The club slipped even lower to Serie IV, where they spent three years.
Seventeen seasons of Serie C: 1960s, 70s and 80s.
From 1959 to 1975, Lecce played 17 seasons in Serie C. They came extremely close to promotion several times during that period, finishing in second place three seasons in a row (1971–72, 1972–73, 1973–74) before gaining promotion in the 1975–76 season.
The same year as their promotion, Lecce tasted cup success, winning the Coppa Italia Serie C. In 1976, Lecce took part in the Anglo-Italian Cup, notching up a 4–0 victory against Scarborough.
In 1980, a scandal occurred which rocked Italian football, including Lecce under president Franco Jurlano. However, Jurlano was able to demonstrate his innocence and the scandal only lead to disqualification of player Claudius Merlo. Later, the club was struck by a tragedy in 1983: players Michele Lo Russo and Ciro Pezzella died in an automotive accident. To this day, Lo Russo remains the club record holder for most number of appearances, with 415.
Promotion to Serie A: mid-1980s and 90s.
Under the management of Eugenio Fascetti, Lecce would achieve promotion to Serie A for the first time in 1985. They finished bottom and were relegated after only one season, but defeated Roma 3–2 away in the penultimate game to deal a fatal blow to Roma's title hopes. Losing a promotion play-off 2–1 to Cesena the following season, they would return to Serie A in 1988.
Under Carlo Mazzone, Lecce finished a respectable ninth place in 1989. Stars of the side included striker Pedro Pasculli and midfielders Antonio Conte and Paolo Benedetti. They lasted three seasons before relegation, and returned two years later. The 1993–94 season saw Lecce finish in last place with a pitiful 11 points, the lowest ever of any Serie A team, and a second relegation came the following year.
Giampiero Ventura saw Lecce achieve two successive promotions from Serie C to Serie A before leaving for Cagliari. Once more, it proved a struggle in Serie A despite the best efforts of striker Francesco Palmieri and a famous away win against Milan on 19 October 1997.
In the summer of 1998, Pantaleo Corvino was appointed new sports director, gaining a reputation for scouting new talents in the years to come. The team was good enough to return to Serie A in 1999 and begin another three-year stint in the top-flight, with yet another return to Serie A in 2003.
Three years in Serie A (2003–2006).
In 2004, under Delio Rossi, who had been managing the club since 2002, Lecce achieved an impressive result, reaching a high-point of tenth despite a poor first half of the season. Famous performances include two sensational victories in a row, first against Italian giants Juventus 3–4 in Turin (the first ever win at the Stadio Delle Alpi for Lecce) and then against Internazionale 2–1 at the Stadio Via del Mare.
In 2004–05, coach Zdeněk Zeman oversaw a highly attack-minded team that scored plenty of goals. Lecce ended the year again finishing tenth, putting in the spotlight talents like Valeri Bojinov and Mirko Vučinić. The team had the second-best attack with 66 goals (Juventus came first with 67) and the worst defence, with 73 goals conceded. This is a record, as for the first time the team with the worst defence managed to survive in the history of Serie A.
The 2005–06 season was a continual struggle for Lecce. The club changed its manager two times (Silvio Baldini for Angelo Adamo Gregucci and in January 2006 youth team coach Roberto Rizzo, supported by goalkeeper coach Franco Paleari, for Baldini). The numerous managerial moves could not turn Lecce's fortune as they were relegated with a few games to spare and ended the season in 19th place. In June 2006, Giovanni Semeraro returned at the helm of the club after nine months. The club re-appointed Zdeněk Zeman as manager, just one year after he left the club.
Lecce was unable to avoid relegation from Serie A, despite some initial hope due to the Serie A match-fixing scandal.
Two-year stint in Serie B and promotion.
The club had a mixed start to the 2006–07 season in Serie B, winning three home matches (including a win against early league leaders Genoa), though they suffered poor away form. After a large drop in form, recording 10 losses in 18 matches, Zeman was sacked as manager and replaced by Giuseppe Papadopulo. On 10 March 2007, Lecce clinched a historical victory over Frosinone, beaten 5–0 at Stadio Via del Mare. Having gained 36 points in the second half of the season, Lecce ended the season in the middle of the table, in ninth place. In 2007, Lecce gained more points than any other team in Serie B.
The 2007–08 season saw Lecce fight for a place in Serie A for the next season. Despite earning 83 points (12 more than sixth-placed Pisa) and boasting the best defence in the tournament, the "giallorossi" were forced to face play-offs for promotion in the top flight. In the semi-final, they beat Pisa in both legs (1–0 away and 2–1 at home) to secure a place in the final against AlbinoLeffe. Then they won the first leg 1–0 away, before securing a 1–1 draw in the second leg at the Studio Via del Mare to gain promotion.
Between Serie A and Serie B.
After persistent rumours, Papadopulo quit due to a difference of opinion with the general manager of the club and was replaced by Mario Beretta, who had a quite satisfactory start in the 2008–09 Serie A season. He remained in charge for twenty-seven games, but, due to four defeats in the last five matches, with the team one point below the survival zone, he was sacked and Luigi De Canio was appointed new manager. Seven points earned in ten matches were not enough to secure Lecce a spot in the next Serie A season. Relegation was official with one match to spare, after a 1–1 home draw against Fiorentina.
Lecce had a mixed start in the 2009–10 Serie B campaign, but clinched first place in November 2009 and kept it for the rest of the season. In May, the team was on the verge of promotion, but wasted opportunities in their last two matches meant they had to wait until the last match to celebrate their eighth elevation to the top flight in the last 25 years. A goalless home draw with Sassuolo proved enough to clinch the Serie B title with 75 points and win the Coppa Ali della Vittoria.
Lecce ended a satisfactory 2010–11 Serie A season successfully avoiding relegation with one match to spare after beating arch-rival and already relegated Bari 2–0 away on 15 May 2011. In the last few matches, the team managed to win a tough battle against other underdogs and some glorious teams such as Sampdoria that ended the season in despair. Manager Luigi De Canio left the team in June.
In the 2011–12 Serie A season, Lecce was relegated to Serie B. The start of the season was bad and new manager Eusebio Di Francesco was sacked in December, after 9 losses in 13 matches. Serse Cosmi was appointed new manager. Lecce refused to crumble as Cosmi's arrival instilled battling qualities into the relegation strugglers, who managed to gain a considerable number of points in the following months, but eventually failed to avoid relegation, due to four losses in the last five matches. Lecce managed to struggle until the final game.
Third division years.
On 10 August 2012, Lecce was provisionally relegated by the Disciplinary Commission set up for the "Scommessopoli" scandal investigations 2012–13 Lega Pro Prima Divisione because of their involvement. Furthermore, the former president of Lecce, Semeraro, was suspended from all football activities for five years. On 22 August 2012, Lecce's relegation was confirmed by the Federal Court of Justice. In the first season back into the third tier, Lecce ended in second place behind outsiders Trapani and was surprisingly defeated in the promotion playoffs finals by another outsider club, Carpi. The following season ended in similar fashion, with Lecce failing to win the league once again and then losing the playoffs finals, this time to Frosinone, despite a number of high-level signings such as former Palermo star, and well-known Lecce supporter, Fabrizio Miccoli. In 2014–15 Lecce ended the season in sixth place and did not enter the playoffs.
Following the departure of the Tesoro family, the club was taken over by a consortium of entrepreneurs led by Saverio Sticchi Damiani. The club ended the 2015–16 season in third place, two points behind the second-placed team, and qualified for the playoffs round. After defeating Bassano 3–0 at home, in the semi-finals Lecce lost to Foggia in both the home and the away match. In the following season, Lecce finished in second place. The elimination came in the play-off quarterfinals against Alessandria on penalties after two draws in two matches.
Back to the top.
In September 2017, Fabio Liverani was named new coach of Lecce, with whom he achieved two direct promotions from Serie C to Serie A, thus bringing the Salento club back to the Italian top-tier league after seven years. Lecce then fought against Genoa for survival and made it to the last day of the 2019–20 season before being relegated with a home loss to Parma. The "salentini" missed out promotion to Serie A in the 2020–21 season, losing to Venezia in the play-off semifinals after a 4th-place finish, but then, with coach Marco Baroni, won the 2021–22 Serie B championship, thus celebrating their tenth elevation to the top flight and being awarded the Coppa Nexus. Lecce striker Massimo Coda was top scorer of the Serie B for two seasons in a row in 2020–21 and 2021–22. The "giallorossi" side then gained survival in the next Serie A campaign with a game to spare, with Baroni and Lecce parting ways at the end of the 2022–23 season.
Colours, badge, nicknames, and symbols.
The team plays in red and yellow stripes, the heraldic colours of city. Lecce players and fans are referred to as "salentini" or "giallorossi". The official anthem of Lecce is "Giallorossi per Sempre" composed by Gioy Rielli. The symbol of Lecce is a female wolf under a holm oak tree which is typical to Apulia and is also the symbol of the city of Lecce.
Stadium.
Lecce's home games are played in the 31,533-seater Stadio Via del mare.
Club rivalries.
The main rivalry is with the other most successful football team from Apulia, SSC Bari. The match against them is called "Derby di Puglia". The first "Derby di Puglia" was played on 8 December 1929 in Serie B in Lecce, with the home team winning 1–0. After that occasion, the derby di Puglia was played many times in Serie C and Coppa Italia, and especially in Serie A. The first derby played in Serie A was played on 27 October 1985 in Bari, and was won by the home team. The last one was also played in Bari on 15 May 2011 and saw Lecce prevailing by 2-0 and securing their stay in Serie A (however that match was later object of an investigation for match-fixing). Among the most important wins in the derby for Lecce there is a Serie B match ended 4–0 in Bari on 22 December 2007.
On the other end, Lecce has a famous and long-standing friendship with the fans of Palermo.

LR Vicenza

Association football club in Vicenza, Italy
Football club
L.R. Vicenza, commonly referred to as Vicenza, is an Italian football club based in Vicenza, Veneto. Founded in 1902 as Associazione del Calcio in Vicenza, they became Lanerossi Vicenza in 1953, then Vicenza Calcio from 1990 to 2018, a year which saw the club going bankrupt and being put under controlled administration to preserve the Serie C spot at the end of the 2017–18 season. Renzo Rosso, owner of fashion brand Diesel, merged its Bassano Virtus and some of the assets of Vicenza Calcio into one team, L.R. Vicenza Virtus, which will play in Vicenza, while the two sides will preserve their distinct youth teams. Vicenza is the oldest team in Veneto; officially founded on 9 March 1902 by the then dean of Liceo Lioy, Tito Buy, and the physical education teacher of the same school, Libero Antonio Scarpa.
The club currently plays in Italy's Serie C, having spent the entire 1960s, most of the 1970s and a large part of the 1990s in Serie A. They won the 1996-97 Coppa Italia and reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup the following season, losing to eventual winners Chelsea. Their best finish in Serie A is as runner-up in the 1977-78 season, led by top scorer Paolo Rossi with 24 goals.
History.
Vicenza competed in the Italian Championship for the first time in 1911; reaching the finals for the title before being defeated by Pro Vercelli, one of the top Italian clubs at the time. During the 1920s and the 1930s, the team played in the lower divisions, reaching the first division for the first time in 1942. In the last round of the season, a 6–2 win versus Juventus in Turin, meant a final relegation escape.
In 1947, Vicenza finished fifth in Serie A but was relegated at the end of the following season.
Lanerossi Vicenza.
The early 1950s were quite troublesome due to economic problems, but in 1953 the club was bought by Lanerossi, a woollen firm from Schio, with the side being renamed Lanerossi Vicenza.
Between 1955 and 1975 Vicenza never left the top level, always putting a hard fight against more established clubs. In this period the side was also known as "Nobile Provinciale" ("Noble Provincial"). 
In 1964 and 1966 it finished 6th, with the Brazilian Luis Vinicio finishing league's top-scorer in the former with 25 goals.
In 1975 the club was relegated, however, after winning the 1976–77 second division, they would eventually finish runners-up in the following season with a young Paolo Rossi led the scoring charts with 24 goals. In that year the side was nicknamed "Real Vicenza". Club chairman Giuseppe Farina had just bought the striker from Juventus for a then-record fee of 2.6 billion lire, but the team would eventually drop two divisions in just three seasons.
In the mid-1980s, Roberto Baggio started his career at the club, leading it in 1984-85 to the Serie B. In 1986 Vicenza achieved a top-flight promotion that was subsequently denied due to its involvement in the second Totonero match-fixing scandal. The club was soon relegated back to Serie C1.
Vicenza Calcio.
In 1990 Vicenza took back its current name and was promoted to Serie B in 1993, thanks to coach Renzo Ulivieri. His successor, Francesco Guidolin took the team back to Serie A in 1995 and led it through successive successful seasons. After finishing ninth in the league, the club won the 1996–97 Italian Cup with a 3–1 aggregate win over Napoli, eventually reaching next year's Cup Winners' Cup semi-finals, being defeated by Chelsea after winning the first leg in Vicenza for 1–0.
In 1999 the team was relegated to Serie B and after a return to the top flight in 2000–01, was relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione in 2005, after losing a relegation playout against Triestina. However, the club was readmitted to Serie B as F.I.G.C. had determined that Genoa C.F.C. had fixed the final match of the season.
In the season 2011–12, the club was relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione after losing the relegation play-off against Empoli. Vicenza, however, was reinstated in Serie B at the eve of the 2012–13 season in place of Lecce for its role in the 2011–12 Italian football scandal. However, the club finished the 2012–13 in 19th place; missing out on the play-out and were finally relegated after reprieves in the previous two seasons.
Vicenza ended the 2013–14 season in fifth place, being successively defeated by Savona in the promotion play-offs, and were due to play the 2014–15 season in the unified Lega Pro division, that would have featured an unprecedented crosstown derby against Real Vicenza. However, the dissolution of Siena meant Vicenza were promoted to become the 22nd team in Serie B. Vicenza were relegated again at the conclusion of the 2016–17 Serie B after finishing 20th.
Changes in ownership.
The club entered a debt restructuring process since March 2016, which the new director stating that the club required a re-capitalization of at least €20 million. Vi.Fin. S.p.A., a special purpose vehicle for a consortium of new investors, provided just €2.5 million new shares of the club in May 2016. Immediately before the recapitalization, Vi.Fin. acquired most of the shares of the club from Finalfa S.r.l., a company owned by Sergio Cassingena.
Former Vicenza chairman Tiziano Cunico and CEO Dario Cassingena were also sued by the prosecutor of Italian Football Federation (FIGC) in September 2016 for allegations of reporting false profits from player exchanges with Parma; where prices were inflated relative to their performances in the first team. The players under the investigation that involving Vicenza were Sandrini (sold to Parma for Malivojević; both players were tagged for €1.2 million) Eventually the club and directors were inadmissible from the charge due to expiry of the legal proceeding. In a different matter, Dario Cassingena was sentenced 10 months (in probation) by the Court of Vicenza, after the football club failed to paid the value-added tax in time.
On 1 June 2017 the contract of general manager Andrea Gazzoli was resolved in a mutual consent and on 5 June, Alfredo Pastorelli resigned as the chairman; citing the financial troubles of the club. On 10 July 2017, Luxembourg-based Boreas Capital Sàrl announced it would buy the club. The parent company of Boreas Capital was Dubai-based G.S. Holding.
However, the club faced another financial trouble during the first season of new ownership. "Football Italia" reported that the club failed to pay the wage since September 2017.
Vicenza was declared bankrupt on 18 January 2018. The team finished as the 17th of the group B of 2017–18 Serie C season, beating Santarcangelo in a relegation "play-out" matches.
The Rosso years: L.R. Vicenza Virtus/L.R. Vicenza.
On 24 May 2018, Bassano Virtus, a fellow Serie C team also from the Province of Vicenza owned by Renzo Rosso and his family, were relocated to Vicenza for the 2018–19 Serie C, starting using also the white-and-red Vicenza colours and being renamed L.R. Vicenza Virtus, while keeping both the youth systems of Vicenza and Bassano. The new club was lately formalized as a merger between the original Vicenza and Bassano Virtus, following Rosso family's OTB Group's acquisition of some of the assets of Vicenza Calcio in order to make the merger possible.
The newly-formed L.R. Vicenza Virtus finished in eighth place in the 2018–19 Serie C season. They were promoted the following season as Group B champions, thus marking Vicenza's return to Serie B after just two years.
On 1 July 2021, the club dropped "Virtus" from its official name, thus being renamed L.R. Vicenza S.p.A..

Empoli FC

Italian professional football club
Football club
Empoli Football Club, commonly referred to as Empoli, is an Italian football club based in Empoli, Metropolitan City of Florence. Founded in 1920, the side is part of a select group of Italian football clubs not based in a provincial capital city that have participated in Serie A.
Empoli has spent most of its history in professional football. Empoli competed in European competitions once, in which they were eliminated in the qualification stage of 2007–08 UEFA Cup.
History.
From the 1920s to the 1970s.
In August 1920 in Empoli , "Foot Ball Club Empoli" and the football section "Unione Sportiva Empoli" were born. After the participation of a tournament in San Miniato, the two merged into a single local football club. The next season, the new club, after having obtained in September affiliation in the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) ratified by the Tuscan Regional Committee, was included in Group A of the Tuscan Promozione 1921–22, but did take part due to economic problems, choosing instead to join the league of Terza Categoria, where the team achieved second place in the group A.
In the 1922–23 season, Empoli finished in second place in Group A of the Terza Categoria, gaining admission to the final round after winning the play-off in Florence, held on 15 April 1923 against Pontedera, 1–0. The season concluded with a third place in the group final.
From 1923 to 1926, Empoli continued to play in the Tuscan third division. Then, in the 1926–27 season, Empoli won the Group A division of Tuscany, and was admitted to the interregional finals; thanks to a fourth place in Group G, the Tuscans were promoted in the North Division of the Second Division 1927–28, the third Italian football tier of the era. In the following season the team was then inserted in Group C of the North Division, which concluded in fourth place, but for economic reasons refused the invitation to take part in the next championship of Prima Divisione, and therefore followed the downgrading of the Seconda Divisione from third to fourth tier. However, already the following season, in the 1928–29 Seconda Divisione, the club won promotion, winning the Tuscan championship, and returned to the North Division of Prima Divisione.
Empoli was in the Prima Divisione, then Serie C, until the 1935–36 season, when the team withdrawn halfway through the season because of the call to arms for many of its players. Empoli resumed competitive activity from Prima Divisione the next season, under the name of "OND Empoli", with the colours grey and blue; the team won the Tuscan Group A again gaining admission in Serie C. Until the shutdown from the causes of war, Empoli played in Serie C, obtaining a best result of sixth place in 1938–39. Meanwhile, the club was renamed "OND Interaziendale Italo Gambaccioni Section Soccer" from 1938 to 1941, until the name was changed again to "Associazione Calcio Empol". On 15 September 1935, Empoli debuted in the Coppa Italia with a 1–0 home success against Pontedera.
After World War II, Empoli took up the club name of "Empoli Foot Ball Club" after being called "Sports Group Azelio Landi" for a brief period between October and November 1944, and was admitted into Serie B thanks to a third-place finish in the 1945–46 season. In Serie B, Empoli played for four consecutive seasons, finishing in third place in the 1946–47 season. Relegation of the club – which by then had adopted the colour blue – occurred at the end of 1949–50 championship. The permanence in Serie C lasted for six seasons: in the summer of 1955, the club sold most of its players and at the end of the 1955–56 season, the Tuscan side were relegated to Serie D. After three seasons in the fourth division, in 1959–60 the "Azzurri" risked relegation to the regional level after finishing in 15th place, on equal points with Carrarese and Rieti. The club managed to escape relegation before drawing with Carrarese and then surpassing Lazio, in Pesaro, with a goal from Vezzosi. In 1960–61, Empoli returned to the third tier of Italian football, but for only one season, again suffering relegation.
The club returned to Serie C on 9 June 1963 after beating Tempio 2–0 in the play-off in Genoa. The club's permanence in the third tier of Italian football, then called Serie C1, lasted for 20 years until the 1982–83 season.
The 1980s and 1990s.
In 1986, the small-town club was promoted to Serie A. Playing their first few home games in Florence, Empoli's Serie A debut resulted in a 1–0 win over Internazionale. Helped by a nine-point deduction from Udinese, they avoided relegation with 23 points and 13 goals in 30 games. Empoli themselves received a five-point penalty the following season, and were relegated despite an improved showing. They were relegated again to Serie C1 in 1989.
This club then spent several seasons in Serie C1 before returning to Serie B in 1996 and achieving a second successive promotion in 1997. With Luciano Spalletti at the helm, Empoli defied the odds to finish in 12th place and avoid relegation. Relegation the following year began a three-year stay in Serie B, in which time the club became renowned for nurturing its own outstanding young talent.
Promotions to Serie A in 2002 and 2005 have seen the club emerge as battlers against relegation. They ended the 2005–06 season in tenth place in the top-flight. As a result of the Serie A match-fixing scandal at the end of that season, they gained qualification for the UEFA Cup for the following season, but did not participate as club management failed to apply for a UEFA licence. In the 2006–07 season, the club once again qualified for the UEFA Cup.
The years 2000 and participation in the UEFA Cup.
With the prospect of European football approaching, the management strengthened the squad, most notably signing a number of young players from large Serie A clubs, such as Rincón of Inter, Ignazio Abate and Lino Marzoratti of Milan and Sebastian Giovinco, Claudio Marchisio and Rej Volpato of Juventus on loan or co-ownership deals. Empoli marked their debut in the UEFA Cup with a two-legged match against Zürich, losing 4–2 on aggregate. A poor showing in the initial part of the season then led chairman Fabrizio Corsi to sack Luigi Cagni, who led the Tuscans to UEFA Cup qualification, and replace him with Alberto Malesani. However, the club's fortunes did not change and Malesani was sacked after a 2–0 defeat to Sampdoria which left them at the bottom of the table. Cagni was re-appointed on 31 March 2008 but the team suffered a last-minute relegation. Cagni resigned and was replaced by Silvio Baldini ahead of the 2008–09 season. Baldini's tenure, however, did not prove to be successful, as the Tuscans ended the season only in fifth place, and were later defeated in the promotion playoffs by Brescia.
Between Serie B and Serie A.
Despite modest results, Baldini was sacked. By December 2011, the club had gone through four coaches since the 2009–10 season. The club maintained their Serie B status dramatically in 2011–12. After a poor season, Empoli finished 18th, one point from safety, which meant a relegation play-off against Vicenza over two legs. The first game finished goalless before Vicenza led 2–0 in the second leg with 30 minutes to go. However, two goals in two minutes saw the "Azzuri" level the tie before Massimo Maccarone secured a 3–2 victory in the fourth minute of injury time. 2012–13 saw the club finish fourth, a dramatic improvement on the previous season, but lost the promotion play-off final to Livorno over two legs. The club secured promotion back to Serie A the following season, finishing as runners-up to Palermo and stayed in the top flight for two seasons, finishing 15th in 2014–15 and 10th in 2015–16. Going into the final matchday of the 2016–17 Serie A season, Empoli were one point above the relegation zone ahead of Crotone, however were eventually relegated to Serie B after they failed to beat Palermo, while Crotone beat Lazio. After a triumph of the 2017–18 Serie B, Empoli promptly regained promotion to Serie A, after winning Serie B on 28 April 2018, four matches in advance. In the final matchday of the 2018–19 Serie A season, Empoli were one point above the relegation zone ahead of Genoa, however were eventually relegated to Serie B after they were defeated by Internazionale; while Genoa drew with Fiorentina, both sides finished on the same number of points, but Genoa had a greater goal difference by one. However, Empoli finished first in the 2020–21 Serie B season, their third title in the competition in their history, and so returned to Serie A after two seasons.

AC Cesena

Italian football club
Football club
AC Cesena, commonly referred to as Cesena (), was an Italian football club based in Cesena, Emilia-Romagna. The club spent most of its history in professional leagues such as Serie A and Serie B, but went bankrupt and folded in 2018. Another club from Cesena, A.S.D. Romagna Centro Cesena, claims to be the bankrupted club's successor and in 2019 changed its name to "Cesena F.C.".
The club was formed in 1940 and won its first promotion to Serie A in 1973. Since then, the club have been in Serie A for a total of 13 seasons, their best achievement coming in 1976 with a sixth-placed finish and a short run in the following season's UEFA Cup. The other four promotions to Serie A were achieved in 1981, 1987, 2010 (after two consecutive promotions — from the third league (Lega Pro) in 2009 and from Serie B in 2010, both won on the final day of the season) and 2014.
History.
Founded in 1940, Cesena reached Serie B in 1968 and were promoted to Serie A for the first time in 1973. With players such as Pierluigi Cera and Gianluigi Savoldi, the club held its own and finished a respectable 11th place in their debut season, repeating that finish the following year. In the 1975–76 season, Cesena surprised Italy by finishing sixth and subsequently qualifying for the UEFA Cup. The glory was short-lived and they would be relegated the next year.
A second promotion to Serie A followed in 1981 and finished a respectable 10th before being relegated once more in 1983, staying in Serie B for four years. After winning a play-off, they were back in Serie A for 1987–88 and enjoyed a four-year stay, being obdurate enough to just avoid relegation in this time.
After relegation in 1991, Cesena had another chance to return to Serie A in 1994. With players such as Alessandro Teodorani, Emiliano Salvetti, Luigi Piangerelli, Aldo Dolcetti, and Dario Hübner, this was a team of considerable ability. They finished level on points with Padova, however, and lost a promotion play-off which would be a bitter blow for the club, who would suffer relegation to Serie C1 in 1997. Whilst promotion followed, a relegation play-off against Pistoiese in 2000 would see them condemned to a four-year stay in the third division.
In the 2005–06 Serie B, Cesena surprisingly emerged as contenders for promotion to Serie A, ending in sixth place and being therefore qualified for the promotion play-offs. They escaped relegation the following season, but not in 2007–08.
Cesena's first campaign in Serie C1, now rebranded Lega Pro Prima Divisione, started with former Foligno boss Pierpaolo Bisoli as new head coach. Throughout the season, Cesena quickly emerged as major contenders for direct promotion, and managed to take first place in the league on Week 33, with only one game remaining and a two-point advantage to challengers Pro Patria. On the final week of the season, Cesena's 0–0 draw with Verona, coupled with Pro Patria's 0–0 draw with Padova, gave the "bianconeri" the league title and direct promotion back to Serie B, after only one season in the Italian third tier. Cesena went to as 3rd in Round 33, one point behind Brescia in the 2009–10 season. Cesena earned their second consecutive promotion after a 1–0 victory at Piacenza and Brescia's 2–1 loss in Padua against Padova on 30 May 2010, finishing 19 years of absence from the Serie A.
Serie A and B.
Cesena returned to Serie A after 19 years of absence in 2010. After the 2011–12 season, Cesena were relegated from the top tier to the Serie B.
Since relegation Cesena also restructured their finance, which the company revered merger with intermediate holding company Cesena 1940 Srl in December 2012. The company held 98.23% shares of AC Cesena SpA. After the merger, another intermediate holding company, Opera Cesena Calcio Srl represented by Igor Campedelli (from unknown investor through Romagna Sport Srl), which previously own 65.03% shares on Cesena 1940 Srl, sold 27.6% shares of Cesena to GMG Srl, a company of Giorgio Lugaresi, who already owned 30.06% shares of Cesena 1940 Srl before the merger. On 24 April 2013 Giorgio Lugaresi was re-elected as the president of A.C. Cesena SpA. After the transactions the club also recapitalized €9.5 million during 2013–14 season in order to avoid bankruptcy, which GMG Srl through subsidiary Cesena &amp; Co. Scarl, held 9,499,000 out of 9,500,000 shares (99.9895%) of Cesena as of 30 June 2014, with a nominal value of €1 per shares. In February 2014 Cesena was under criminal investigation for the fraud in Campedelli era. Campedelli was banned 6 months in March 2013 by FIGC.
Despite the financial difficulties, Cesena won promotion back to Serie A on 18 June 2014, winning Latina in playoffs in 4–2 aggregate. In that match, most of the players (12 out of 20) were on loan from other clubs, with only 4 players were under Cesena contract in starting lineup (Renzetti, De Feudis, Garritano and Defrel) and 4 players on the bench (Alberto Iglio, Consolini, Rodríguez and Succi). Financially, Cesena had another year of negative EBITDA in 2013–14 season, for about €11 million, if excluding windfall profit from player trading from the calculation.
In September 2016, the club and former chairman Campedelli were also sued by the prosecutor for false accounting in player-swap (Fabbri–Palumbo as well as Nagatomo–Caldirola–Garritano) Eventually the directors were inadmissible from the charge due to expiry of the legal proceeding but the club chose to plead guilty for a fine of €80,000.
In June 2018, Cesena was charged for false accounting again in the player swap with Chievo. The prosecutor request to penalize Cesena for up to 15 points, accusing the price tag in the deals were inflated. However, as Cesena was folded in 2018, the club was not penalized. An appeal to a department of Italian National Olympic Committee, stating the point deduction should be applied to 2017–18 season, causing Virtus Entella, which originally relegated in 2017–18 Serie B season, made another appeal to Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale del Lazio, for re-admission back to 2018–19 Serie B.
On 16 July 2018 Cesena declared bankruptcy and were banned from participating in 2018–19 Serie B.
Phoenix club.
In July 2018 A.S.D. Romagna Centro, or known as Romagna Centro, applied to rename as "Cesena F.C.", as a phoenix club of A.C. Cesena.

Hellas Verona FC

Italian association football team
Football club
Hellas Verona Football Club, commonly referred to as Hellas Verona or simply Verona, is an Italian professional football club based in Verona, Veneto, that currently plays in Serie A. The team won the Serie A Championship in the 1984–85 season.
History.
Origins and early history.
Founded in 1903 by a group of high school students, the club was named "Hellas", at the request of a professor of classics. At a time in which football was played seriously only in the larger cities of northwestern Italy, most of Verona was indifferent to the growing sport. However, when in 1906 two city teams chose the city's Roman amphitheatre as a venue to showcase the game, crowd enthusiasm and media interest began to rise.
During these first few years, Hellas was one of three or four area teams playing at a municipal level while fighting against city rivals Bentegodi to become the city's premier football outfit. By the 1907–08 season, Hellas was playing against regional teams, and an intense rivalry with Vicenza that has lasted to this day was born.
From 1898 to 1926, Italian football was organised into regional groups. In this period, Hellas was one of the founding teams of the early league and often among its top final contenders. In 1911, the city helped Hellas replace the early, gritty football fields with a proper venue. This allowed the team to take part in its first regional tournament, which until 1926, was the qualifying stage for the national title.
In 1919, following a return to activity after a four-year suspension of all football competition in Italy during World War I, the team merged with city rival Verona and changed its name to Hellas Verona. Between 1926 and 1929, the elite "Campionato Nazionale" assimilated the top sides from the various regional groups. Hellas Verona joined the privileged teams, yet struggled to remain competitive.
Serie A, as it is structured today, began in 1929, when the "Campionato Nazionale" turned into a professional league. Still an amateur team, Hellas merged with two city rivals, Bentegodi and Scaligera, to form AC Verona. Hoping to build a first class contender for future years, the new team debuted in Serie B in 1929. It would take the "gialloblu" 28 years to finally achieve their goal. After first being promoted to Serie A for one season in 1957–58, in 1959, the team merged with another city rival (called Hellas) and commemorated its beginnings by changing its name to Hellas Verona AC.
Success in the 1970s and 1980s.
Coached by Nils Liedholm, the team returned to Serie A in 1968 and remained in the elite league almost without interruption until 1990. Along the way, it scored a famous 5–3 win in the 1972–73 season that cost Milan the "scudetto" (the Serie A title). The fact that the result came late during the last matchday of the season makes the sudden and unexpected end to the "rossoneri"'s title ambitions all the more memorable.
In 1973–74, Hellas finished the season in fourth-last, just narrowly avoiding relegation, but were nonetheless sent down to Serie B during the summer months as a result of a scandal involving team president Saverio Garonzi. After a year in Serie B, Hellas returned to Serie A.
In the 1975–76 season, the team had a successful run in the Coppa Italia, eliminating highly rated teams such as Torino, Cagliari and Internazionale from the tournament. However, in their first ever final in the competition, Hellas were trounced 4–0 by Napoli.
Under the leadership of coach Osvaldo Bagnoli, in 1982–83 the team secured a fourth-place in Serie A (its highest finish at the time) and even led the Serie A standings for a few weeks. The same season Hellas again reached the Coppa Italia final. After a 2–0 home victory, Hellas then travelled to Turin to play Juventus but were defeated 3–0 after extra time.
Further disappointment followed in the 1983–84 season when the team again reached the Coppa Italia final, only to lose the Cup in the final minutes of the return match against defending Serie A champions Roma
The team made its first European appearance in the 1983–84 UEFA Cup and were knocked out in the second round of the tournament by Sturm Graz. Hellas were eliminated from the 1985–86 European Cup in the second round by defending champions and fellow Serie A side Juventus after a contested game, the result of a scandalous arbitrage by the French Wurtz, having beaten PAOK of Greece in the first round.
In 1988, the team had their best international result when they reached the UEFA Cup quarterfinals with four victories and three draws. The decisive defeat came from German side Werder Bremen.
1984–1985 "Scudetto".
Although the 1984–85 season squad was made up of a mix of emerging players and mature stars, at the beginning of the season no one would have regarded the team as having the necessary ingredients to make it to the end. Certainly, the additions of Hans-Peter Briegel in midfield and of Danish striker Preben Elkjær to an attack that already featured the wing play of Pietro Fanna, the creative abilities of Antonio Di Gennaro and the scoring touch of Giuseppe Galderisi were to prove crucial.
To mention a few of the memorable milestones on the road to the "scudetto": a decisive win against Juventus (2–0), with a goal scored by Elkjær after having lost a boot in a tackle just outside the box, set the stage early in the championship; an away win over Udinese (5–3) ended any speculation that the team was losing energy at the midway point; three straight wins (including a hard-fought 1–0 victory against a strong Roma side) served notice that the team had kept its polish and focus intact during their rival's final surge; and a 1–1 draw in Bergamo against Atalanta secured the title with a game in hand.
Hellas finished the year with a 15–13–2 record and 43 points, four points ahead of Torino with Internazionale and Sampdoria rounding out the top four spots. This unusual final table of the Serie A (with the most successful Italian teams of the time, Juventus and Roma, ending up much lower than expected) has led to many speculations. The 1984–85 season was the only season when referees were assigned to matches by way of a random draw. Before then each referee had always been assigned to a specific match by a special commission of referees ("designatori arbitrali"). After the betting scandal of the early 1980 (the Calcio Scommesse scandal), it was decided to clean up the image of Italian football by assigning referees randomly instead of picking them, to clear up all the suspicions and accusations always accompanying Italy's football life. This resulted in a quieter championship and in a completely unexpected final table.
In the following season, won again by Juventus, the choice of the referees went back in the hands of the "designatori arbitrali". In 2006, a major scandal in Italian football revealed that certain clubs had been illegally influencing the referee selection process in an attempt to ensure that certain referees were assigned to their matches.
Between Serie A and Serie B.
These were more than mere modest achievements for a mid-size city with a limited appeal to fans across the nation. But soon enough financial difficulties caught up with team managers. In 1991 the team folded and was reborn as Verona, regularly moving to and fro between Serie A and Serie B for several seasons. In 1995 the name was officially returned to Hellas Verona.
After a three-year stay, their last stint in Serie A ended in grief in 2002. That season emerging international talents such as Adrian Mutu, Mauro Camoranesi, Alberto Gilardino, Martin Laursen, Massimo Oddo, Marco Cassetti and coach Alberto Malesani failed to capitalise on an excellent start and eventually dropped into fourth-to-last place for the first time all season on the final match day, enforcing relegation into Serie B.
Decline and Serie A comeback (2002–present).
Following the 2002 relegation to Serie B, team fortunes continued to slip throughout the decade. In the 2003–04 season Hellas Verona struggled in Serie B and spent most of the season fighting off an unthinkable relegation to Serie C1. Undeterred, the fans supported their team and a string of late season wins eventually warded off the danger. Over 5,000 of them followed Hellas to Como on the final day of the season to celebrate.
In 2004–05, things looked much brighter for the team. After a rocky start, Hellas put together a string of results and climbed to third spot. The "gialloblù" held on to the position until January 2005, when transfers weakened the team, yet they managed to take the battle for Serie A to the last day of the season.
The 2006–07 Serie B seemed to start well, due to the club takeover by Pietro Arvedi D'Emilei, which ended nine years of controversial leadership under chairman Gianbattista Pastorello, heavily contested by the supporters in his later years at Verona. However, Verona was immediately involved in the relegation battle, and Massimo Ficcadenti was replaced in December 2006 by Giampiero Ventura. Despite a recovery in the results, Verona ended in an 18th place, thus being forced to play a two-legged playoff against 19th-placed Spezia to avert relegation. A 2–1 away loss in the first leg at La Spezia was followed by a 0–0 home tie, and Verona were relegated to Serie C1 after 64 years of play in the two highest divisions.
Verona appointed experienced coach Franco Colomba for the new season with the aim to return to Serie B as soon as possible. However, despite being widely considered the division favourite, the "gialloblù" spent almost the entire season in last place. After seven matches, club management sacked Colomba in early October and replaced him with youth team coach (and former Verona player) Davide Pellegrini. A new owner acquired the club in late 2007, appointing Giovanni Galli in December as new director of football and Maurizio Sarri as new head coach. Halfway through the 2007–08 season, the team remained at the bottom of Serie C1, on the brink of relegation to the fourth level (Serie C2). In response, club management sacked Sarri and brought back Pellegrini. Thanks to a late-season surge the "scaligeri" avoided direct relegation by qualifying for the relegation play-off, and narrowly averted dropping to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione in the final game, beating Pro Patria 2–1 on aggregate. However, despite the decline in results, attendance and season ticket sales remained at 15,000 on average.
For the 2008–09 season, Verona appointed former Sassuolo and Piacenza manager Gian Marco Remondina with the aim to win promotion to Serie B. However, the season did not start impressively, with Verona being out of the playoff zone by mid-season, and club chairman Pietro Arvedi D'Emilei entering into a coma after being involved in a car crash on his way back from a league match in December 2008. Arvedi died in March 2009, two months after the club was bought by new chairman Giovanni Martinelli.
The following season looked promising, as new transfer players were brought aboard, and fans enthusiastically embraced the new campaign. Season ticket figures climbed to over 10,000, placing Verona ahead of several Serie A teams and all but Torino in Serie B attendance. The team led the standings for much of the season, accumulating a seven-point lead by early in the spring. However, the advantage was gradually squandered, and the team dropped to second place on the second-last day of the season, with a chance to regain first place in the final regular season match against Portogruaro on home soil. Verona, however, disappointed a crowd of over 25,000 fans and, with the loss, dropped to third place and headed towards the play-offs. A managerial change for the post-season saw the firing of Remondina and the arrival of Giovanni Vavassori. After eliminating Rimini in the semi-finals (1–0; 0–0) Verona lost the final to Pescara (2–2 on home soil and 0–1 in the return match) and were condemned to a fourth-straight year of third division football.
Former 1990 World Cup star Giuseppe Giannini (a famous captain of Roma for many years) signed as manager for the 2010–11 campaign. Once again, the team was almost entirely revamped during the transfer season. The squad struggled in the early months and Giannini was eventually sacked and replaced by former Internazionale defender Andrea Mandorlini, who succeeded in reorganising the team's play and bringing discipline both on and off the pitch. In the second half of the season, Verona climbed back from the bottom of the division to clinch a play-off berth (fifth place) on the last day of the regular season. The team advanced to the play-off final after eliminating Sorrento in the semi-finals 3–1 on aggregate. Following the play-off final, after four years of Lega Pro football, Verona were promoted back to Serie B after a 2–1 aggregate win over Salernitana on 19 June 2011.
On 18 May 2013, Verona finished second in Serie B and were promoted to Serie A after an eleven-year absence. Their return to the top flight began against title contenders Milan and Roma, beating the former 2–1 and losing to the latter 3–0. The team continued at a steady pace, finishing the first half of the season with 32 points and sitting in sixth place, eleven points behind the closest UEFA Champions League spot—and tied with Internazionale for the final UEFA Europa League spot. Verona, however, ultimately finished the year in tenth.
During the 2015–16 season, Verona had not won a single match since the beginning of the campaign until the club edged Atalanta 2–1 on 3 February 2016 in a win at home; coming twenty-three games into the season. Consequently, Verona were relegated from Serie A.
In the 2016–17 Serie B season, Hellas Verona finished second on the table and were automatically promoted back to Serie A. Hellas lasted one season back in the top division after finishing second last during the 2017–18 Serie A season and were relegated back to Serie B. At the end of the 2018–19 season, Hellas finished in fifth position and achieved promotion back to Serie A after defeating Cittadella 3–0 in the second leg of their promotion play-off to win 3–2 on aggregate.
The club's return to the top flight in the 2019–20 Serie A season, in which it was considered a strong relegation candidate at the beginning of the campaign, was a successful one, with a ninth-placed finish. Heavily reliant on the defensive solidity of 20-year-old centre-back Marash Kumbulla, Amir Rrahmani and goalkeeper Marco Silvestri, along with the consistent performances of midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, Verona was a surprise contender for Europa League qualification but fell out of the race after a downturn in form after the coronavirus break, which temporarily halted the season. A 2–1 win at home against eventual title winners Juventus in February was a highlight of a season in which the club achieved 10 clean sheets and punched towards the higher end of the table despite its modest budget.
Ahead of Verona's second consecutive year in Serie A, key players Amrabat, Rrahmani and Kumbulla were poached by Fiorentina, Napoli and Roma respectively, and loanee Matteo Pessina returned to Atalanta. This left the club with a heavily weakened squad and it was once again expected to struggle in the league prior to the season-opening match. Despite these losses in the transfer window, Verona again finished in the top half of the league table, ending the season in 10th place with 45 points. Successful breakout seasons for attacking midfielder Mattia Zaccagni, who was eventually called up to the Italy national team as a reward for his performances, as well as wing-backs Federico Dimarco and Davide Faraoni, were partly the reason for this achievement. At the end of the season, coach Ivan Jurić was appointed by Torino following his two impressive Serie A seasons with Verona, with the "Gialloblu" replacing him with Eusebio Di Francesco.
Following another summer transfer window in which several of the club's star players were sold to Serie A rivals, namely Zaccagni transferring to Lazio, Marco Silvestri to Udinese and Dimarco returning to Inter, the beginning of the 2021-22 season proved to be much more difficult for Verona, as Di Francesco was fired and replaced with Igor Tudor after just three matches, all of which were defeats. This poor early-season form had left the club at the bottom of the table. Under the guidance of Tudor, the team regains competitiveness obtaining in the next eight matches three wins – including victories with Lazio and Juventus – four draws and only one defeat.
Colours and badge.
The team's colours are yellow and blue. As a result, the clubs most widely used nickname is "gialloblu" literally "yellow-blue" in Italian. The colours represent the city itself and Verona's emblem (a yellow cross on a blue shield) appears on most team apparel. Home kits are traditionally blue, sometimes of a navy shade, combined with yellow details and trim, although the club has used a blue and yellow striped design on occasion. Two more team nicknames are "Mastini" (the mastiffs) and "Scaligeri", both references to Mastino I della Scala of the Della Scala princes that ruled the city during the 13th and 14th centuries.
The Scala family coat of arms is depicted on the team's jersey and on its trademark logo as a stylised image of two large, powerful mastiffs facing opposite directions, introduced in 1995. In essence, the term "scaligeri" is synonymous with Veronese, and therefore can describe anything or anyone from Verona (e.g., Chievo Verona, a different team that also links itself to the Scala family – specifically to Cangrande I della Scala).
Stadium.
Since 1963, the club have played at the Stadio Marc'Antonio Bentegodi, which has a capacity of 39,211. It is the eighth-largest stadium in Italy by capacity. The stadium is named after the historic benefactor of Veronese sport, Marcantonio Bentegodi.
The ground was shared with Hellas's rivals, Chievo Verona until that club dissolved in 2021. It was used as a venue for some matches of the 1990 FIFA World Cup and renovations prior to the tournament included an extra tier and a roof to cover all sections, improved visibility, public transport connections, an urban motorway connecting the city centre with the stadium and the Verona Nord motorway exit and services.
Derby with Chievo Verona.
The intercity fixtures against Chievo Verona are known as the "Derby della Scala". The name refers to the Scaligeri or della Scala aristocratic family, who were rulers of Verona during the Middle Ages and early Renaissance.
Hellas, founded in 1903, were traditionally the main club in Verona. Chievo, founded in 1929, historically represented the small Verona suburb of the same name, using a small parish field as their home ground, and did not become a professional side until 1986. At that time, Chievo became tenants of Hellas at the Bentegodi, and began rising up the league ladder. By the mid-1990s, Chievo had joined Hellas in Serie B, creating the derby. During the teams' early Serie B meetings, Hellas supporters taunted Chievo with the chant "Quando i mussi volara, il Ceo in Serie A" – "Donkeys will fly before Chievo are in Serie A." Once Chievo earned promotion to Serie A at the end of the 2000–01 season, their fans started calling the team "i Mussi Volanti" (The Flying Donkeys). A 2014 story in the British football magazine "Late Tackle" remarked that "Hellas fans didn’t so much have their words rammed down their throat as forced through every orifice with a barge pole."
In the season 2001–02, both Hellas Verona and the city rivals of Chievo Verona were playing in the Serie A. The first ever derby of Verona in Serie A took place on 18 November 2001, while both teams were ranked among the top four. The match was won by Hellas, 3–2. Chievo got revenge in the return match in spring 2002, winning 2–1. Verona thus became the fifth city in Italy, after Milan, Rome, Turin and Genoa to host a cross-town derby in Serie A.

Delfino Pescara 1936

Italian association football club
Football club
Delfino Pescara 1936, commonly referred to as Pescara, is a professional Italian football club based in Pescara, Abruzzo.
The club was formed in 1936 and currently plays in Serie C. Pescara has competed in seven seasons in Serie A, 1977–78, 1979–80, 1987–88, 1988–89, 1992–93, 2012–13 and last participated in 2016–17. The team's official colors are white and light blue varied between either azure or sky blue, manifested in striped shirts with white socks and shorts.
History.
Aside from a spell in Serie B in the 1940s, Pescara had a relatively undistinguished history until promotion to Serie B in 1974. With players like Giorgio Repetto and Bruno Nobili in the midfield, they managed to win their first promotion to Serie A in 1977 after winning the promotion play-off, but ultimately finished their first season in Serie A in last place. A second promotion after a play-off followed, but once more they would be relegated from the top flight and then descended to Serie C1 within two years.
Nonetheless, after returning to Serie B after a year, Pescara would enjoy a revival after the appointment of Giovanni Galeone as coach in 1986. His philosophy of attacking football saw the "Biancazzurri" promoted to Serie A as champions in 1987, where they lasted two years with players such as Júnior and Blaž Slišković among the club's stars. Galeone would return during the 1990–91 season and oversaw another promotion the following year.
After relegation, Pescara remained in Serie B side throughout the 1990s, narrowly missing promotion in 1999. Relegation to C1 followed in 2001, with promotion in 2003 being followed by two revoked relegations in a row due to bankruptcy and scandals affecting other clubs. Pescara was ultimately relegated in the 2006–07 season, with three presidential and managerial changes during the season. In December 2008, the debt-ridden club was legally declared out of business and its control passed to a bankruptcy trustee appointed by the Court of Pescara. In February 2009, a takeover from a group named Delfino Pescara 1936 was finalized, with Deborah Caldora becoming the first woman to serve as chairman of the club. In the meantime, results did not improve significantly and in March, Giuseppe Galderisi was dismissed from the head coaching post, with Antonello Cuccureddu being appointed as the new boss.
At the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Eusebio Di Francesco was appointed as the new coach. Pescara finished second in Girone B of Lega Pro Prima Divisione and qualified for the promotional play-offs. They defeated Reggiana in the semi-final and Verona in the final, and subsequently returned to Serie B after a three-year absence. The following season started with the appointment of Zdeněk Zeman as new head coach; the Czech manager immediately brought Pescara back into national coverage thanks to his well-known all-attacking playing style that turned out to match perfectly with promising youngsters such as Marco Verratti with loanees Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne, who guided the squad to promotion to Serie A. Pescara secured promotion to the top-level after a 19-year absence after defeating Sampdoria with a 3–1 score in an away match on 20 May 2012. In the last minute of the final game of the regular season, Pescara striker Riccardo Maniero netted the winner in a match against Nocerina to claim Pescara's second Serie B title after Torino's draw away to AlbinoLeffe.
Pescara's 2012–13 campaign in Serie A – after losing Zeman, Verratti, Immobile and Insigne – ended with relegation back to the second tier. Three years later, under World Cup winner Massimo Oddo, the team returned to Serie A with a 3–1 aggregate win over Trapani in the playoff final. Zeman returned in February 2017 to the team, who again lasted just one year at the top before being relegated in last place.
In August 2018, Pescara launched a public mini-bond investment opportunity via sports investment platform Tifosy to raise a minimum of €2,000,000. The investment scheme raised a total of €2,300,000 to develop the club's youth sector and facilities.
Following an online competition to ease children's boredom during the coronavirus lockdown, the team adopted six-year-old Luigi D'Agostino's shirt design for the 2020 season.
After a poor 2020-21 campaign, the side were relegated to Serie C, the third tier of Italian football.
Supporters.
Pescara's most passionate fan groups began to form in the early 1970s, in conjunction with the rise of the 'ultras' movement in Italy. The "Rangers" group, which to date is the most renowned section of the club's fanbase, was founded in 1976. Other historical fan groups include "Bad Boys" (founded in 1985 and dissolved during the Serie B 2003-2004 season) and "Cherokee" (founded in 1987 and merged with "Rangers" in 1999 alongside minor fan groups). In 2002, a set of supporters from the nearby seaside resort of Silvi joined the "Rangers" group. In 2012, a new ultras group called "A Difesa di una Fede" was formed, and is usually seated in Curva Sud or - if the sector is assigned to away fans - in Tribuna Adriatica.
During home games, "Rangers" and most fan groups are located in Curva Nord, which is named after Marco Mazza (nicknamed "Bubù)," a head ultras who passed away prematurely in 2006. 
Pescara is widely supported across Abruzzo, with most supporters residing in the actual city of Pescara and nearby towns.
'Gemellaggi' and rivalries.
Pescara's fanbase has been twinned, in what is known as a "gemellaggio," with Vicenza's supporters since 9th January 1977. It is the world's first "gemellaggio" in football, and the bond and sense of affinity between Pescara and Vicenza supporters is still strong to this day.
One of Pescara's biggest rivals is Lazio. The rivalry started on 30th October 1977 when Lazio fans attacked Pescara supporters after the game. The initial assault was followed by several other clashes in coming years both in Pescara and Rome. 
Another important rivalry is with Hellas Verona, originated due to localist reasons and Verona's friendship with Lazio ultras. The rivalry was cemented at the end of the 2009/2010 season when the clubs met in the Serie C play-off finals - Pescara won and was promoted to Serie B.
Other noticeable rivals include Ascoli, Bari, Sambenedettese, Salernitana, Foggia, Cesena and Catania.

Treviso FBC 1993

Association football club
Football club
Treviso Foot Ball Club 1993, commonly known as Treviso, is an Italian football club based in Treviso, Veneto, which competes in Serie D, the fourth tier of Italian football.
"Football Club Treviso" was originally founded in 1909, while the current society dates back to 1921. The team has been playing its home matches in the 10,000-seat Stadio Omobono Tenni since 1933.
History.
Foundation and early years.
The club was founded in 1909 as Football Club Treviso and never played in the top flight of Italian football, always taking part in the lower national divisions, from Serie B to Serie D, with a sixth place in the 1950–51 Serie B table, under head coach Nereo Rocco, as its best result. In 1993 the club was shut down because of financial troubles.
1990s and 2000s: from amateur to Serie A.
In summer 1993 a new club was admitted to Serie D, as F.B.C. Treviso 1993. The club experienced a remarkable line of three consecutive promotions from 1994 to 1997 under coach Giuseppe Pillon which brought Treviso to Serie B, over 40 years after its last appearance in the second-highest Italian league. Treviso was relegated to Serie C1 in 2001, but returned to Serie B in 2003. In 2005, Pillon returned to Treviso and the team gained a respectable fifth place and a spot in the promotion playoffs but lost out to Perugia. However, in August 2005, after both Genoa and Torino were relegated out of Serie A, respectively for fraud and financial troubles, Treviso and Ascoli were arbitrarily promoted in Serie A as replacements.
In 2005–06, Treviso played in Italian Serie A for the first and, as so far, only time since its foundation. The team was coached by Ezio Rossi, then replaced by Alberto Cavasin. The team was initially forced to play their Serie A home games at the Stadio Euganeo, in the nearby city of Padua, because of the inadequacy of their home stadium, considered inadequate for Serie A matches owing both to security and capacity issues by the FIGC. However, a special legal dispensation was approved by the Italian parliament to allow Treviso to play at their home ground.
Treviso's Serie A stay was short-lived. In bottom place for nearly the entire 2005–06 season, they were officially relegated to Serie B for the '06–'07 campaign following a 3–1 loss to Messina on 9 April 2006. While it initially appeared that Treviso would avoid relegation despite finishing 20th as a result of forced relegations arising elsewhere as a consequence of the Serie A match-fixing scandal, Treviso were eventually relegated to Serie B on 25 July 2006 when S.S. Lazio and ACF Fiorentina's penalties were reduced by the Italian appeals court and those teams remained in Serie A. Back in Serie B Treviso started to face financial problems, with a net loss of €4.17 million in the 2006–07 season. The club had re-capitalized for over €7.5 million, but the net result was still €1.32 million in the 2007–08 season, with some notional selling profit for Dino Fava (who returned to Treviso for the same price, €900,000) and Massimo Coda (in a cash-plus player deal), as well as selling youth product Jacopo Fortunato and Riccardo Bocalon for €900,000 each in cash-plus-play deal (residual 50% rights of Alex Cordaz and Daniel Maa Boumsong (€1.05M in total). Financial irregularities also made FIGC penalize Treviso for 4 points in total, but 3 of them were removed by CONI. Furthermore, rising star Leonardo Bonucci left Treviso in January 2009 and the club lacked funds to reinforce the team since the start of 2008–09. The only deal that received cash from selling was Alessio Sestu (50% for €400,000).
The club ultimately went bankrupt in the summer of 2009, after it suffered relegation from Serie B that same year.
2009 refoundation.
A new club named A.S.D. Treviso 2009 was founded as a successor club, and was admitted to play in the Eccellenza Veneto which at the time was the 6th tier of Italian football, in the summer of 2009.
In the 2010–11 season, Treviso was promoted from Serie D group C to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione and was renamed Football Club Treviso. In the next it was promoted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione. In the 2012–13 season the club was relegated to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, and then excluded again.
The club was successively refounded as A.C.D. Treviso in the summer 2013, restarting from Promozione.
The club achieved promotion to Eccellenza following the 2013–14 season, winning the promotion playoffs.
In 2021, the club changed its name to Treviso F.B.C. 1993 and was promoted to Eccellenza. After failing to secure promotion to the Serie D by losing the playoff against Montecchio Maggiore on penalties, they won Group B of the Eccellenza Veneto in the 2022–23 season, returning to the fourth tier of Italian football after a 10-year absence in a national league. They had a long-standing promotion battle with Calvi Noale, Portomansuè, and Godigese, with the decisive victory coming on the final day at Stadio Omobono Tenni in the derby against Giorgione, ending in a 2–0 win.

US Triestina Calcio 1918

Italian football club
Football club
Unione Sportiva Triestina Calcio 1918, commonly referred to as Triestina, is an Italian football club based in Trieste, Friuli Venezia Giulia. Originally founded in 1918, the club has been re-established several times in its history. As of the 2022–23 season, it plays in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football.
History.
From the foundation to Serie A.
The club was founded in 1918 as merger of local teams "Ponziana" and "Foot-Ball Club Trieste". The club reached Seconda Divisione (now known as Serie B) in 1924. The club successively featured in the first-ever Serie A season in 1929, and played consecutively to the Italian top flight until 1956. During those successful times, the team also featured the likes of local Trieste native Nereo Rocco, who played as winger for Triestina from 1930 to 1937, becoming also the first player from the team to become part of the "Azzurri" squad (in 1934). Successively, Rocco returned to Triestina as a head coach in 1947, and completed the 1947–48 as Serie A runners-up, only behind Torino; this is still, as of today, the best result in history for the Trieste-based club.
Rocco then left in 1950 to be replaced by Hungarian coach Béla Guttman, who managed to save the club from relegation only in the final matchday. Another struggling season followed in 1951–52, with Triestina escaping relegation only after winning playoffs against Lucchese and Brescia. During the 1952–53 season, Cesare Maldini made his Serie A debut in a Triestina jersey. In 1953 Rocco returned to Triestina, but was sacked after 21 matchdays due to poor results. Three more mid-table seasons followed before Triestina suffered its first relegation in 1957. Successively, Triestina returned to Serie A in 1958, but were relegated in their first comeback season, which is also their last top flight campaign to date.
The club were successively relegated to Serie C in 1961 once, in 1965 twice, and even Serie D in 1971, forcing the "alabardati" to a local derby with "Ponziana" in 1975. The club returned to Serie C in 1976, and was admitted to Serie C1 in 1978, and finally returned to Serie B in 1983, missing promotion to the top flight for a few seasons before being relegated in 1988. Triestina also played in second level between 1962–1965 and 1989–1991.
The first refoundation in 1994.
In 1994, the team was forced to fold, because of financial insolvency, and was re-founded by Giorgio Del Sabato. The team restarted as U.S. Triestina Calcio from Serie D and was readmitted to Serie C2 by the federation one year later. In 2001, after six seasons in Serie C2, the club won promotion to Serie C1 after playoffs; this was followed by a second consecutive promotion, this time to Serie B, both under head coach Ezio Rossi.
In the 2005–06 season, Triestina changed its manager five times. The list include the tandem Alessandro Calori-Adriano Buffoni, Pietro Vierchowod, caretaker Francesco De Falco, youth team coach Vittorio Russo and Andrea Agostinelli.
In addition, Triestina's owner Flaviano Tonellotto was forced to resign on 1 February 2006 by the magistrates because of a pending court procedure for bankruptcy, and his wife Jeannine Koevoets was named to replace him at the helm of the club. However, Tonellotto was successively ordered to leave the association because of financial troubles. The magistrates named Francesco De Falco as caretaker chairman with the idea of finding somebody interested to buy the club. Curiously, in the 2005–06 De Falco, a player for Triestina in the 80's, covered three different roles in the club: director of football, manager and chairman. In April 2006 the team was purchased by the Fantinel family, owners of a wine company in the region.
In recent years, Triestina struggled to mount a promotion campaign to end half-century absence from the Italian top flight. Triestina finished 8th in 2008–2009 season. However failed to remain in Serie B in the 2009–10 season, with a crashing 3–0 defeat to Padova at the play-outs, and was relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione after 8 years of endeavour in the second tier of Italian football, only to be readmitted to Serie B after Ancona filed for bankruptcy.
On 21 May 2011, in the season 2010–11, after a disastrous campaign, Triestina was relegated from Serie B to Lega Pro Prima Divisione, having returned there in 2002 after 11 seasons in Serie C and Serie D.
2012: Relegation and bankruptcy.
On 25 January 2012 the club in strong financial difficulty, has been declared bankrupt by the court of Trieste.
In the season 2011–12 Triestina was relegated from Lega Pro Prima Divisione group B to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.
On 19 June 2012 the club was finally declared bankrupt and the team was disbanded.
Stefano Mario Fantinel, former chairman of the club, was suspended from football activities for 5 years after the prosecutor found accounting irregularities of the club. In July, three more months were added due to player transfer irregularities. Fantinel was also suspended for 3 months in 2006–07 Serie B, also causing the club 1 point, for irregularities on preparing quarterly management report on 30 March 2006.
Unione Triestina 2012 / U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918.
On 31 July 2012 was founded the new company Unione Triestina 2012 S.S.D.  a. r.l. that restarted from Eccellenza thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F. The sports title was later transferred to another "limited company in amateur sport" () U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918 s.s.d. a. r.l. in 2016. After the promotion to Serie C on 4 August 2017, the company dropped the legal suffix "amateur sport" from the name.
Colors and badge.
The club's badge features a white spontoon or halberd—from where the club gets the nickname "Gli Alabardati" (The Halberded)—on a red background. This is inspired by the coat of arms and flag of the city of Trieste. Other features of the badge include a shining white star and the words "U. S. Triestina". After this badge, the team's colours both home and away are red and white.

FC Crotone

Italian professional football club
Football club
Football Club Crotone S.r.l., or simply Crotone, is an Italian football club based in Crotone, Calabria. Founded on 20 September 1910, Crotone holds its home games at Stadio Ezio Scida, which has a 16,647 seat capacity.
History.
The club is based in the ancient Greek settlement of Kroton, one of the first Greek colonies in what is now known as modern day Italy. The club is proud of their Greek origins with their banners and slogans and regularly depicting Greek icons such as soldiers of Sparta.
The first team from Crotone, "Società sportiva Crotona", was founded on 20 September 1910, but without adhering to Italian Football Federation, and the following main teams of Crotone, like "Milone Crotone", did not participate before 1921 in several minor leagues including "Prima Divisione" (which later would be known as Serie C). Following World War II, a new club, "Unione Sportiva Crotone" replaced the previous one, playing seven seasons in Serie C.
In 1963, the club was relegated to Serie D, but returned to the third division the following year, remaining there for fourteen consecutive seasons, missing promotion in 1977 when finishing third behind Bari and Paganese. In 1978, following the Italian football league reorganisation, Crotone was relegated to Serie C2 and the following year was declared bankrupt. A new club, "Associazione Sportiva Crotone", began competing again in the "Prima Categoria" (eighth division).
Crotone was promoted to Serie C2 in 1984–85, but only for one season. The team's name was changed to "Kroton Calcio", and the club was promoted again to C2 after the 1986–87 season, where it played until 1991. A second bankruptcy led to the foundation of Football Club Crotone Calcio with Raffaele Vrenna as chairman, starting in the "Promozione" (7th level). Crotone gained successive promotions to Serie C2 and C1, winning in the play-offs against Locri and Benevento, respectively.
Under Antonello Cuccureddu, Crotone first reached Serie B in 2000, returning to the second level two seasons later. Again in division two in 2004, after disposing of Viterbese in the promotion play-offs, it remained in the category until the 2006–07 season.
After being beaten by Taranto in the 2008 play-offs, Crotone returned to the second division the following season, defeating Benevento.
The team was promoted to Serie A, the Italian top flight, for the first time in its history in 2016. In the 2016–17 season, the club finished 17th, securing a place in the next Serie A season. This was despite the Calabrian side only winning two points from the first ten matches, one of the poorest starts the Italian top-flight had seen in years. Crotone remained in the relegation positions for almost the entire season before an impressive revival saw the club achieve a seven-match unbeaten run from matchdays 30 to 36, including five wins in that time, and the season was concluded with a 3-1 victory over Lazio on the last matchday, a result that saw Crotone jump above Empoli to 17th place and thus secured another season in Serie A in what was hailed as a football miracle, led by 13-goal top scorer Diego Falcinelli and coach Davide Nicola.
In the following season, Crotone failed to avoid relegation after losing against Napoli in the last match of the Serie A campaign, returning to Serie B after two seasons.
Following the 2019-20 season, the club was promoted to Serie A once more in second place, only behind Benevento in the table. However, the club's top-flight campaign was less than satisfactory. After spending the majority of the season in the last spot of the table, and losing incredible matches that were an early indicator of the hardship the club would endure, Crotone was mathematically relegated to Serie B after 34 games, following a loss to would-be champions Inter. This relegation came in contrast to several excellent performances from individual players, particularly striker Simy, who scored 20 league goals during the season, a record for a relegated team. Nevertheless, the 92 goals Crotone conceded was one more than Casale conceded in 1933-34, setting a new Serie A record for goals against in a single season.
To reduce wage bills following relegation to Serie B, the club loaned out attacking midfielder Junior Messias to AC Milan with an option for the latter to buy, and striker Simy to Salernitana (sold to the latter in January 2022). The team's attacking power weakened. Crotone finished 19th in the league and suffered a second successive relegation to 2022-23 Serie C.
Colours and badge.
Team colours are dark blue and white, due to their Greek origins, and also red. The club's kits are traditionally dark blue and red stripes.
The team's mottos are "Salutate la Magna Grecia" ("Salute Greater Greece") and "Noi siamo la Magna Grecia" ("We are Greater Greece").

Udinese Calcio

Italian association football club
Football club
Udinese Calcio, commonly referred to as Udinese, is a professional Italian football club based in Udine, Friuli Venezia Giulia, that currently competes in the Serie A. It was founded on 30 November 1896 as a sports club, and on 5 July 1911 as a football club.
The traditional team home kit is black and white striped shirt, black shorts, and white socks. The club broadcasts on channel 110 (Udinese Channel) on digital terrestrial television in the north-east of Italy. It has many fans in Friuli and the surrounding areas.
History.
Foundation and early years.
Udinese Calcio was established in 1896 as part of the "Società Udinese di Ginnastica e Scherma", (Udinese Society of Gymnastics and Fencing). In its inaugural year, the club won the Torneo FNGI in Treviso beating Ferrara 2–0; however, this title is not recognised as official.
On 5 July 1911, some gymnasts of Udinese, headed by Luigi Dal Dan, founded the A.C. Udinese, which joined the FIGC. The new side made its debut in a friendly match against Juventus , and won 6–0.
It was only in 1912–13 that Udinese first took part in an official FIGC championship. In that year they enrolled in the "Campionato Veneto di Promozione", which consisted of just three teams (the others were Petrarca and Padova). With two victories against Padova (3–1 and 5–0), Udinese finished the tournament in second place behind Petrarca and were promoted to first-level Prima Categoria. In Prima Categoria, Udinese failed to reach the national stage, always knocked out in the "Eliminatoria Veneta".
1920s: Coppa Italia final.
The 1920–21 season, which ended with the Friulani eliminated in the "Eliminatoria Veneta", was memorable because it was the debut of Gino Bellotto, who is still the player who has played the most seasons with Udinese, spending 17 seasons with the "Zebrette".
In 1922, Udinese, taking advantage of the absence of big clubs, entered the FIGC Italian Football Championship and reached the Coppa Italia final losing 1–0 against Vado, thanks to an overtime goal.
In the league, Udinese finished second in "Girone Eliminatorio Veneto", which allowed them to remain in the top flight for the next season, despite a reform of the championships that reduced the number of teams in the competition.
The 1922–23 season was a disastrous one for Udinese, as they came last in and were relegated to the second division. The team risked failure for debts in 1923. On 24 August 1923, AS Udinese separated from AC Udinese Friuli, and the club was forced to set up a budget and an autonomous board. All debts were paid by President Alessandro Del Torso through the sale of some of his paintings, and Udinese could thus join the Second Division in which they came fourth.
The 1924–25 season was memorable. The team was included in Group F II Division. The championship was very even and at the end of the tournament three teams were in contention to win: Udinese, Vicenza and Olympia River. Playoffs were needed to determine who would reach the final round.
Udinese beat Olympia in a playoff 1–0 and drew 1–1 with Vicenza. In the play-off standings, Udinese and Vicenza were still in the lead with three points each. Another play-off was then played to determine the winner. After a first encounter finished 0–0, Udinese lost a replay 2–1, but were awarded the win as Vicenza fielded an ineligible player, a Hungarian called Horwart. Udinese reached the finals in place of Vicenza.
In the final round, Udinese finished first and was promoted, alongside Parma, to First Division. In the following season, Udinese finished 10th and was relegated again. However, the format of the championship was again reformed, and Udinese had another chance to reclaim their place in the top flight. They competed in play-offs with seven other sides for the right to play in Serie A. The winner would remain in the top flight. The club, however, lost the playoff against Legnano and lost their place in the top flight.
They remained in Second Division until the end of the 1928–29 season when Serie A and Serie B were created, with Udinese falling into the third tier ("Terza Serie"). The first season in Terza Serie was a triumphant one and Udinese were promoted up to Serie B.
1930s and 1940s.
The stay in Serie B lasted only two years, and after the 1931–32 season, the team returned to the third division. Udinese remained in the third tier (later renamed Serie C in 1935) until 1938–39, when coming second in Girone Finale Nord di Serie C, they were promoted to Serie B.
The Zebrette remained in Serie B for a dozen years, with average performances and were relegated to Serie C at the end of the 1947–48 season due to a reform of the championships. This relegation, however, was followed by two consecutive promotions, and thanks to an excellent second-place finish in the Serie B 1949-50, the Friulani won a historic promotion to Serie A.
1950s: second place in A, and relegation back to B.
Udinese remained in Serie A for five seasons, and almost claimed an historic Scudetto in the 1954–55 season, when they came second only behind Milan. It was after that season, however, that Udinese was relegated because of an offence committed on 31 May 1953, the last day of the championship, which was exposed two years later. The Friuliani returned to Serie A after one season in B, and in the following season was confirmed among the best Italian teams with an excellent fourth-place finish.
1960s and 1970s.
A decline followed those good seasons, however, with Udinese first relegated back down to Serie B in 1961–62 and then to Serie C in 1963–64. Udinese remained in C for about fifteen years, missing promotion back to B on numerous occasions. It was only after the 1977–78 season that the Friuliani, led by manager Massimo Giacomini, returned to B winning Girone A. In the same season, they won the "Coppa Italia Semiprofessionisti", beating Reggina and also won the Anglo-Italian Cup.
1980s: Mitropa Cup and the scandal of 1986.
During the next season, Udinese with Massimo Giacomini as their manager, won Serie B and returned after more than two decades to Serie A. In their first year back after so long, the team survived after a disappointing 15th-place finish. In Europe, they fared muc better, winning the Mitropa Cup, a European Cup for teams that had won the previous season of Serie B.
In subsequent seasons, the team managed to survive relegation without any particular difficulty, also managing an impressive sixth place in 1982–83. At that time, Udinese had on its books one of the club's all-time greatest players, the Brazilian midfielder Zico.
At the end of the 1985–86 season, the team was embroiled in a betting scandal, and was penalised nine points for the 1986–87 season. Despite a desperate comeback towards the end of the season, Udinese were relegated to Serie B. Had they not been deducted points, Udinese would have survived.
1990s and early 2000s: Europe.
During the following years, Udinese were promoted to Serie A and relegated back to B on several occasions. This situation lasted until the 1995–96 season, from which point on, they established themselves in Serie A.
The 1996–97 season saw Udinese qualify for the UEFA Cup, with Alberto Zaccheroni as manager. The following season, they managed a third-place finish behind Juventus and Internazionale, largely thanks to Oliver Bierhoff's 27 goals.
In March 2001, Luciano Spalletti was appointed manager, replacing Luigi De Canio. Spalletti managed to lead the team to survival on the penultimate matchday. Following brief periods with Roy Hodgson and Giampiero Ventura on the bench, Spalletti was again appointed manager of Udinese at the beginning of the 2002–03 season, finding an organised and ambitious club which again reached the UEFA Cup, playing attacking and entertaining football.
The surprising fourth-place finish at the end of the 2004–05 season saw Udinese achieve their first qualification for the UEFA Champions League in the history of the club. At the end of that same season, Spalletti announced his intention to leave Udinese.
The following season, Udinese played in the Champions League preliminary round, beating Sporting CP 4–2 on aggregate. Udinese were drawn in a tough group alongside Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen and Barcelona.
 Despite a 3–0 win over Panathinaikos in their first match, courtesy of a Vincenzo Iaquinta hat trick, the team failed to qualify for the knockout rounds, coming in third in their group, equal on points with second placed Werder and behind eventual champions Barcelona.
Recent history.
After a year in the Champions League, Udinese finished tenth and returned once more to mid-table mediocrity. The turning point occurred during the summer of 2007, when the club announced the appointment of Sicilian manager Pasquale Marino, and also made various quality purchases, including Fabio Quagliarella and Gökhan Inler.
The 2007–08 season started well, with a draw at home against champions Internazionale, but the enthusiasm was quickly erased after the first home match, which finished in a 5–0 loss to newly promoted Napoli. After this match, Udinese's fortunes changed, starting with a victory over Juventus, thanks to a late Antonio Di Natale goal. Udinese remained in contention for the fourth Champions League spot with Milan, Fiorentina, and Sampdoria until the end of the season, but ultimately finished in seventh place, qualifying for the UEFA Cup.
At the start of the 2008–09 season, during the press conference to present the new season's kit, the new official website was also presented, and an absolute novelty in the Italian championship, the first Web TV channel dedicated to a football club called Udinese Channel was launched, totally free and visible worldwide. 
In the 2008–09 season, Udinese had a mixed bag of results in Serie A with a 3–1 win at Roma and a 2–1 win over Juventus, but ten losses against teams including Reggina, Chievo, and Torino dented their hopes of Champions League qualification. In the UEFA Cup, Udinese found themselves in a group with potential favourites Tottenham Hotspur, NEC, Spartak Moscow, and Dinamo Zagreb, but eased through the group with a convincing 2–0 win against Tottenham. They beat Lech Poznań in the next round 4–3 on aggregate, and then beat holders Zenit Saint Petersburg 2–1 on aggregate. In the quarter-final against Werder Bremen, with injuries to star players Antonio Di Natale, Samir Handanovič, and Felipe, they lost 6–4 on aggregate. Fabio Quagliarella scored eight goals in the campaign. They finished the season in seventh place, missing out on any European football the following year.
The 2009–10 season was a disappointing one for players and fans alike. Even though Antonio Di Natale managed to score 29 goals in the league and finished top goalscorer, the season was spent battling against relegation. In the end, they finished in 15th, nine points and three places clear of the relegation zone. The only highlight of the campaign was reaching the semi-final of the Coppa Italia, beating Lumezzane in the round of 16, Milan in the quarter-finals, and eventually losing 2–1 to Roma on aggregate.
In the summer transfer window of 2010, Udinese sold Gaetano D'Agostino, Simone Pepe, Marco Motta, and Aleksandar Luković. They also brought in players that proved to be the key to their success in the 2010–11 Serie A; Mehdi Benatia and Pablo Armero, a central defender and wingback, respectively. After a poor start to the season, losing their first four games and drawing the fifth, Udinese went on to record their highest points total in history and finished in fourth place, again earning themselves a spot in the Champions League qualifying round. Di Natale, with 28 goals, became the first back-to-back "capocannoniere" since Lazio's Giuseppe Signori accomplished the feat in 1993 and 1994. A 0–0 home draw with Milan on the final matchday secured the Champions League spot for Udinese. Coach Francesco Guidolin kept his promise of "dancing like Boateng" if they qualified for the Champions League and did a little jig in the middle of the pitch. In the Coppa Italia, Udinese lost to Sampdoria in the round of 16 on penalties after the match ended 2–2.
The 2011–12 season continued in much the same fashion, even though Udinese lost three key players to larger clubs – Alexis Sánchez to Barcelona, Gökhan Inler to Napoli, and Cristián Zapata to Villarreal. In the Champions League qualifying round, Udinese were drawn against Arsenal and lost the away leg 1–0. At the Stadio Friuli, Udinese lost 2–1, 3–1 on aggregate, and entered the Europa League group stage, Antonio Di Natale missing a penalty that, at the time, would have taken Udinese through. Domestically, Udinese started strong but with their quality shown in defence, conceding the least of all teams after 15 games, only seven. For the second consecutive season, Udinese qualified for the Champions League, clinching third place on the final day of the season with a 2–0 away win against Catania. In the summer transfer window, key players Kwadwo Asamoah and Mauricio Isla were both sold to champions Juventus. The club failed to reach the group stage of the year's Champions League, however, losing on penalties after extra time to Portuguese club SC Braga. Antonio Di Natale scored 23 goals to record his third consecutive season with 20+ goals in Serie A.
Udinese started off the 2012–13 Serie A season in mixed form, with seven draws and three losses in their first thirteen games. However, starting in December the team began to pick up wins more frequently, concurrent with Di Natale finding the net on a regular basis. After a period of balancing wins with losses, the team went on a phenomenal eight game winning streak to end the season, with Luis Muriel emerging as a key player. Like the 2011–12 season, Di Natale again finished with 23 goals, becoming the first player since Gabriel Batistuta, of Fiorentina, to score 20 or more goals in four or more consecutive seasons.
Over the coming years, Udinese would go on to finish middle to lower table in Serie A. In the 2017–18 season, Udinese manager Massimo Oddo was sacked after the club lost 11 straight games. Oddo was then replaced by Igor Tudor, who guided the club to safety away from the relegation places.

Inter Milan

Italian association football club
Football club
Football Club Internazionale Milano, commonly referred to as Internazionale () or simply Inter, and colloquially known as Inter Milan in English-speaking countries, is an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Inter is the only Italian side to have always competed in the top flight of Italian football since its debut in 1909.
Founded in 1908 following a schism within the Milan Cricket and Football Club (now AC Milan), Inter won its first championship in 1910. Since its formation, the club has won 36 domestic trophies, including nineteen league titles, nine Coppa Italia, and eight Supercoppa Italiana. From 2006 to 2010, the club won five successive league titles, equalling the all-time record at that time. They have won the European Cup/Champions League three times: two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965, and then another in 2010. Their latest win completed an unprecedented Italian seasonal treble, with Inter winning the Coppa Italia and the "Scudetto" the same year. The club has also won three UEFA Cups, two Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.
Inter's home games are played at the San Siro stadium, which they share with city rivals AC Milan. The stadium is the largest in Italian football with a capacity of 75,817. They have long-standing rivalries with Milan, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, and Juventus, with whom they contest the Derby d'Italia; their rivalry with the former is one of the most followed derbies in football. As of 2019,[ [update]] Inter has the highest home game attendance in Italy and the sixth-highest attendance in Europe. Since 2016, the club has been majority-owned by Chinese holding company Suning Holdings Group. Inter is one of the most valuable clubs in Italian and world football.
History.
Foundation and early years (1908–1960).
The club was founded on 9 March 1908 as "Football Club Internazionale", following the schism with the Milan Cricket and Football Club (now AC Milan). The name of the club derives from the wish of its founding members to accept foreign players without limits as well as Italians.
The club won its first championship in 1910 and its second in 1920. The captain and coach of the first championship winning team was Virgilio Fossati, who was later killed in battle while serving in the Italian army during World War I. In 1922, Inter was at risk of relegation to the second division, but they remained in the top league after winning two play-offs.
Six years later, during the Fascist era, the club was forced to merge with the "Unione Sportiva Milanese" and was renamed "Società Sportiva Ambrosiana". During the 1928–29 season, the team wore white jerseys with a red cross emblazoned on it; the jersey's design was inspired by the flag and coat of arms of the city of Milan. In 1929, the new club chairman Oreste Simonotti changed the club's name to "Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana" and restored the previous black-and-blue jerseys; however, supporters continued to call the team "Inter", and in 1931 new chairman Pozzani caved in to shareholder pressure and changed the name to "Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana-Inter".
Their first Coppa Italia (Italian Cup) was won in 1938–39, led by the iconic Giuseppe Meazza, after whom the San Siro stadium is officially named. A fifth championship followed in 1940, despite Meazza incurring an injury. After the end of World War II, the club regained its original name, winning its sixth championship in 1953 and its seventh in 1954.
"Grande Inter" (1960–1967).
In 1960, manager Helenio Herrera joined Inter from Barcelona, bringing with him his midfield general Luis Suárez, who won the European Footballer of the Year in the same year for his role in Barcelona's La Liga/Fairs Cup double. He would transform Inter into one of the greatest teams in Europe. He modified a 5–3–2 tactic known as the "Verrou" ("door bolt"), which created greater flexibility for counterattacks. The "catenaccio" system was invented by an Austrian coach, Karl Rappan. Rappan's original system was implemented with four fixed defenders, playing a strict man-to-man marking system, plus a playmaker in the middle of the field, who plays the ball together with two midfield wings. Herrera would modify it by adding a fifth defender, the sweeper or libero, behind the two centre backs. The sweeper or libero, who acted as the free man, would deal with any attackers who went through the two centre backs. Inter finished third in the Serie A in his first season, second the next year and first in his third season. Then followed a back-to-back European Cup victory in 1964 and 1965, earning him the title "il Mago" ("the Wizard"). The core of Herrera's team were the attacking full-backs Tarcisio Burgnich and Giacinto Facchetti, Armando Picchi the sweeper, Suárez the playmaker, Jair the winger, Mario Corso the left midfielder and Sandro Mazzola, who played on the inside-right.
In 1964, Inter reached the European Cup Final by beating Borussia Dortmund in the semi-final and Partizan in the quarter-final. In the final, they met Real Madrid, a team that had reached seven out of the nine finals to date. Mazzola scored two goals in a 3–1 victory, and then the team won the Intercontinental Cup against Independiente.
A year later, Inter repeated the feat by beating two-time winner Benfica in the final held at home, from a Jair goal, after have defeated Liverpool in semifinals recovery from a 3–1 with a 3–0, and then again beat Independiente in the Intercontinental Cup, becoming the first European team to win two times in a row the competition.
Inter in 1965 came close to win Treble for the first time in European football history after have won also Serie A title but lost 1965 Coppa Italia final played on 29 August 1965.
Inter reached again semifinals in 1966 but this time lost against Real Madrid that later will win the tournament.
In 1967, after Inter have eliminated Real Madrid in quarterfinals, with Suárez injured, Inter lost the European Cup Final on Lisbon 2–1 to Celtic. During that year, the club changed its name to "Football Club Internazionale Milano".
Subsequent achievements (1967–1991).
Following the golden era of the 1960s, Inter managed to win their eleventh league title in 1971 and their twelfth in 1980. Inter were defeated for the second time in five years in the final of the European Cup, going down 0–2 to Johan Cruyff's Ajax in 1972. During the 1970s and the 1980s, Inter also added two to its Coppa Italia tally, in 1977–78 and 1981–82.
Hansi Müller (1975–1982 VfB Stuttgart, 1982–1984 Inter Milan) and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (1974–1984 Bayern Munich, 1984–1987 Inter Milan) played for Inter Milan. Led by the German duo of Andreas Brehme and Lothar Matthäus, and Argentine Ramón Díaz, Inter captured the 1989 Serie A championship. Inter were unable to defend their title, despite adding fellow German Jürgen Klinsmann to the squad and winning their first Supercoppa Italiana at the start of the season.
Mixed fortunes (1991–2004).
The 1990s was a period of disappointment. While their great rivals Milan and Juventus were achieving success both domestically and in Europe, Inter were left behind, with repeated mediocre results in the domestic league standings, their worst coming in 1993–94 when they finished just one point out of the relegation zone. Nevertheless, they achieved some European success, with three UEFA Cup victories, in 1991, 1994 and 1998.
With Massimo Moratti's takeover from Ernesto Pellegrini in 1995, Inter twice broke the world record transfer fee in this period (£19.5 million for Ronaldo from Barcelona in 1997 and £31 million for Christian Vieri from Lazio two years later). However, the 1990s remained the only decade in Inter's history, alongside the 1940s, in which they did not win a single Serie A championship. For Inter fans, it was difficult to find who in particular was to blame for the troubled times and this led to some icy relations between them and the chairman, the managers, and even some individual players.
Moratti later became a target of the fans, especially when he sacked the much-loved coach Luigi Simoni after only a few games into the 1998–99 season, having just received the Italian manager of the year award for 1998 the day before being dismissed. That season, Inter failed to qualify for any European competition for the first time in almost ten years, finishing in eighth place.
The following season, Moratti appointed former Juventus manager Marcello Lippi, and signed players such as Angelo Peruzzi and Laurent Blanc, together with other former Juventus players Vieri and Vladimir Jugović. The team came close to their first domestic success since 1989 when they reached the Coppa Italia final, only to be defeated by Lazio.
Inter's misfortunes continued the following season, losing the 2000 Supercoppa Italiana match against Lazio 4–3, after initially taking the lead through new signing Robbie Keane. They were also eliminated in the preliminary round of the Champions League by Swedish club Helsingborgs, with Álvaro Recoba missing a crucial late penalty. Lippi was sacked after only a single game of the new season following Inter's first ever Serie A defeat to Reggina. Marco Tardelli, chosen to replace Lippi, failed to improve results, and is remembered by Inter fans as the manager who lost 6–0 in the city derby against Milan. Other members of the Inter "family" during this period that suffered were the likes of Vieri and Fabio Cannavaro, both of whom had their restaurants in Milan vandalised after defeats to the "Rossoneri".
In 2002, not only did Inter manage to make it to the UEFA Cup semi-finals, but were also only 45 minutes away from capturing the "Scudetto" when they needed to maintain their one-goal advantage away to Lazio. Inter were 2–1 up after only 24 minutes. Lazio equalised during first half injury time, and then scored two more goals in the second half to clinch victory that eventually saw Juventus win the championship. The next season, Inter finished as league runners-up and also managed to make it to the 2002–03 Champions League semi-finals against Milan, losing on the away goals rule.
Comeback and unprecedented treble (2004–2011).
On 8 July 2004, Inter appointed former Lazio manager Roberto Mancini as its new head coach. In his first season, the team collected 72 points from 18 wins, 18 draws and only two losses, as well as winning the Coppa Italia and later the Supercoppa Italiana. On 11 May 2006, Inter retained their Coppa Italia title once again after defeating Roma with a 4–1 aggregate victory (a 1–1 scoreline in Rome and a 3–1 win at the San Siro).
Inter were awarded the 2005–06 Serie A championship retrospectively, after title-winning Juventus was relegated and points were stripped from Milan due to the "Calciopoli" scandal. During the following season, Inter went on a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in Serie A, starting on 25 September 2006, with a 4–1 home victory over Livorno, and ending on 28 February 2007, after a 1–1 draw at home to Udinese. On 22 April 2007, Inter won their second consecutive "Scudetto"—and first on the field since 1989—when they defeated Siena 2–1 at Stadio Artemio Franchi. Italian World Cup-winning defender Marco Materazzi scored both goals.
Inter started the 2007–08 season with the goal of winning both Serie A and Champions League. The team started well in the league, topping the table from the first round of matches, and also managed to qualify for the Champions League knockout stage. However, a late collapse, leading to a 2–0 defeat with ten men away to Liverpool on 19 February in the Champions League, threw into question manager Roberto Mancini's future at Inter, while domestic form took a sharp turn of fortune, with the team failing to win in the three following Serie A games. After being eliminated by Liverpool in the Champions League, Mancini announced his intention to leave his job immediately only to change his mind the following day. On the final day of the 2007–08 Serie A season, Inter played Parma away, and two goals from Zlatan Ibrahimović sealed their third consecutive championship. Mancini, however, was sacked soon after, due to his previous announcement to leave the club.
On 2 June 2008, Inter appointed former Porto and Chelsea boss José Mourinho as new head coach. In his first season, the "Nerazzurri" won a Suppercoppa Italiana and a fourth consecutive title, though falling in the Champions League in the first knockout round for a third-straight year, losing to eventual finalist Manchester United. In winning the league title, Inter became the first club in the last 60 years to win the title for the fourth consecutive time and joined Torino and Juventus as the only clubs to accomplish this feat, as well as being the first club based outside Turin.
Inter won the 2009–10 Champions League, defeating reigning champions Barcelona in the semi-final, before beating Bayern Munich 2–0 in the final, with two goals from Diego Milito. Inter also won the 2009–10 Serie A title by two points over Roma, and the 2010 Coppa Italia by defeating the same side 1–0 in the final. This made Inter the first Italian team to win the treble. At the end of the season, Mourinho left the club to manage Real Madrid; he was replaced by Rafael Benítez.
On 21 August 2010, Inter defeated Roma 3–1 and won the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana, their fourth trophy of the year. In December 2010, they claimed the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time after a 3–0 win against Mazembe in the final. However, after this win, on 23 December 2010, due to their declining performance in Serie A, the team fired Benítez. He was replaced by Leonardo the following day.
Leonardo started with 30 points from 12 games, with an average of 2.5 points per game, better than his predecessors Benítez and Mourinho. On 6 March 2011, Leonardo set a new Italian Serie A record by collecting 33 points in 13 games; the previous record was 32 points in 13 games, made by Fabio Capello in the 2004–05 season. Leonardo led the club to the quarter-finals of the Champions League before losing to Schalke 04, and lead them to Coppa Italia title. At the end of the season, however, he resigned, and was followed by new managers Gian Piero Gasperini, Claudio Ranieri and Andrea Stramaccioni, all hired during the following season.
Changes in ownership (2011–2019).
On 1 August 2012, the club announced that Moratti was to sell a minority interest of the club to a Chinese consortium led by Kenneth Huang. On the same day, Inter announced an agreement was formed with China Railway Construction Corporation Limited for a new stadium project, however, the deal with the Chinese eventually collapsed. The 2012–13 season was the worst in recent club history, with Inter finishing ninth in Serie A and failing to qualify for any European competitions. Walter Mazzarri was appointed to replace Stramaccioni as the manager for 2013–14 season on 24 May 2013, having ended his tenure at Napoli. He guided the club to fifth in Serie A and to 2014–15 UEFA Europa League qualification.
On 15 October 2013, an Indonesian consortium (International Sports Capital HK Ltd.) led by Erick Thohir, Handy Soetedjo and Rosan Roeslani, signed an agreement to acquire 70% of Inter shares from Internazionale Holding S.r.l. Immediately after the deal, Moratti's Internazionale Holding S.r.l. still retained 29.5% of the shares of FC Internazionale Milano S.p.A. After the deal, the shares of Inter was owned by a chain of holding companies, namely International Sports Capital S.p.A. of Italy (for 70% stake), International Sports Capital HK Limited and Asian Sports Ventures HK Limited of Hong Kong. Asian Sports Ventures HK Limited, itself another intermediate holding company, was owned by Nusantara Sports Ventures HK Limited (60% stake, a company owned by Thohir), Alke Sports Investment HK Limited (20% stake) and Aksis Sports Capital HK Limited (20% stake).
Thohir, who also co-owned Major League Soccer (MLS) club D.C. United and Indonesia Super League (ISL) club Persib Bandung, announced on 2 December 2013 that Inter and D.C. United had formed a strategic partnership. During the Thohir era the club began to modify its financial structure from one reliant on continual owner investment to a more self sustain business model, although the club still breached UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in 2015. The club was fined and received squad reduction in UEFA competitions, with additional penalties suspended in the probation period. During this time, Roberto Mancini returned as the club manager on 14 November 2014, with Inter finishing eighth. Inter finished 2015–2016 season fourth, failing to return to Champions League.
On 6 June 2016, Suning Holdings Group (via a Luxembourg-based subsidiary Great Horizon S.á r.l.) a company owned by Zhang Jindong, co-founder and chairman of Suning Commerce Group, acquired a majority stake of Inter from Thohir's consortium International Sports Capital S.p.A. and from Moratti family's remaining shares in Internazionale Holding S.r.l. According to various filings, the total investment from Suning was €270 million. The deal was approved by an extraordinary general meeting on 28 June 2016, from which Suning Holdings Group had acquired a 68.55% stake in the club.
The first season of new ownership, however, started with poor performance in pre-season friendlies. On 8 August 2016, Inter parted company with head coach Roberto Mancini by mutual consent over disagreements regarding the club's direction. He was replaced by Frank de Boer, who was sacked on 1 November 2016 after leading Inter to a 4W–2D–5L record in 11 Serie A games as head coach. The successor, Stefano Pioli, didn't save the team from getting the worst group result in UEFA competitions in the club's history. Despite an eight-game winning streak, he and the club parted away before season's end, when it became clear they would finish outside the league's top three for the sixth consecutive season. On 9 June 2017, former Roma coach Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Inter manager, signing a two-year contract, and eleven months later Inter clinched a UEFA Champions League group stage spot after going six years without Champions League participation thanks to a 3–2 victory against Lazio in the final game of 2017–18 Serie A. Due to this success, in August the club extended the contract with Spalletti to 2021.
On 26 October 2018, Steven Zhang was appointed as new president of the club. On 25 January 2019, the club officially announced that LionRock Capital from Hong Kong had reached an agreement with International Sports Capital HK Limited, in order to acquire its 31.05% shares in Inter and to become the club's new minority shareholder. After the 2018–19 Serie A season, despite Inter finishing fourth, Spalletti was sacked. In May 2021, American investment firm Oaktree Capital loaned Inter $336 million to cover losses incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Renewed successes (2019–present).
On 31 May 2019, Inter appointed former Juventus and Italian manager Antonio Conte as their new coach, signing a three-year deal. In September 2019, Steven Zhang was elected to the board of the European Club Association. In the 2019–20 Serie A, Inter Milan finished as runner-up, as they won 2–0 against Atalanta on the last matchday. They also reached the 2020 UEFA Europa League final, ultimately losing 3–2 to Sevilla. Following Atalanta's draw against Sassuolo on 2 May 2021, Internazionale were confirmed as champions for the first time in eleven years, ending Juventus's run of nine consecutive titles. However, despite securing Serie A glory, Conte left the club by mutual consent on 26 May 2021. The departure was reportedly due to disagreements between Conte and the board over player transfers. In June 2021, Simone Inzaghi was appointed as Conte's replacement. On 8 August 2021, Romelu Lukaku was sold to Chelsea for €115 million, representing the most expensive association football transfer by an Italian football club ever.
On 12 January 2022, Inter won the Supercoppa Italiana, defeating Juventus 2–1 at San Siro. After conceding a goal to the opponent, Inter equalised with a penalty scored by Lautaro Martínez, and the match finished 1–1 in regulation time. In the last second of the extra-time, Alexis Sánchez scored the winning goal following a defensive error, giving Inter the first trophy of the season, also Simone Inzaghi's first trophy as Inter manager. On 11 May 2022, Inter won the Coppa Italia, defeating Juventus 4–2 at Stadio Olimpico. After normal time had ended 2–2, with Nicolò Barella and Hakan Çalhanoğlu scoring Inter's goals, Ivan Perišić's brace in the extra-time gave Inter the win and a second title of the season. The 2021–22 Serie A campaign saw Inter finish in second place, being the most prolific attacking side with 84 goals. On 18 January 2023, Inter won the Supercoppa Italiana, defeating Milan 3−0 at King Fahd International Stadium, thanks to goals from Federico Dimarco, Edin Džeko, and Lautaro Martinez.
On 16 May 2023, Inter won against Milan in the semi-finals of 2022–23 UEFA Champions League and qualified for the final, the first time they have reached the final in the UEFA Champions League since 2010. However, they were defeated at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium 1−0 by Manchester City after a second half goal from Rodri.
Colours and badge.
One of the founders of Inter, a painter named Giorgio Muggiani, was responsible for the design of the first Inter logo in 1908. The first design incorporated the letters "FCIM" in the centre of a series of circles that formed the badge of the club. The basic elements of the design have remained constant even as finer details have been modified over the years. Starting at the 1999–2000 season, the original club crest was reduced in size, to give place for the addition of the club's name and foundation year at the upper and lower part of the logo respectively.
In 2007, the logo was returned to the pre-1999–2000 era. It was given a more modern look with a smaller "Scudetto" star and lighter colour scheme. This version was used until July 2014, when the club decided to undertake a rebranding. The most significant difference between the current and the previous logo is the omission of the star from other media except match kits.
Since its founding in 1908, Inter have almost always worn black and blue stripes, earning them the nickname "Nerazzurri". According to the tradition, the colours were adopted to represent the nocturnal sky: in fact, the club was established on the night of 9 March, at 23:30; moreover, blue was chosen by Giorgio Muggiani because he considered it to be the opposite colour to red, worn by the Milan Cricket and Football Club rivals.
During the 1928–29 season, however, Inter were forced to abandon their black and blue uniforms. In 1928, Inter's name and philosophy made the ruling Fascist Party uneasy; as a result, during the same year the 20-year-old club was merged with "Unione Sportiva Milanese": the new club was named "Società Sportiva Ambrosiana" after the patron saint of Milan. The flag of Milan (the red cross on white background) replaced the traditional black and blue. In 1929, the black-and-blue jerseys were restored, and after World War II, when the Fascists had fallen from power, the club reverted to their original name. In 2008, Inter celebrated their centenary with a red cross on their away shirt. The cross is reminiscent of the flag of their city, and they continue to use the pattern on their third kit. In 2014, the club adopted a predominantly black home kit with thin blue pinstripes before returning to a more traditional design the following season.
Animals are often used to represent football clubs in Italy – the grass snake, called "Biscione", represents Inter. The snake is an important symbol for the city of Milan, appearing often in Milanese heraldry as a coiled viper with a man in its jaws. The symbol is present on the coat of arms of the House of Sforza (which ruled over Italy from Milan during the Renaissance period), the city of Milan, the historical Duchy of Milan (a 400-year state of the Holy Roman Empire) and Insubria (a historical region the city of Milan falls within). For the 2010–11 season, Inter's away kit featured the serpent.
Stadium.
The team's stadium is the 75,923 seat San Siro, officially known as the "Stadio Giuseppe Meazza" after the former player who represented for 14 seasons Inter and for two Milan. The more commonly used name, "San Siro", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan's chairman at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took &lt;templatestyles src="Fraction/styles.css" /&gt;13+1⁄2 months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Inter, when they were accepted as joint tenant.
The first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Inter beat Milan 6–3 in a friendly match. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations. A major structural renovation was made for the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final while another one took place in late 2021 to host the UEFA Nations League final. The stadium is going to be refurbished again in time for Milano Cortina 2026.
Based on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, owing to the closeness of the stands to the pitch.
New Milano Stadium.
Since 2012, various proposals and projects by Massimo Moratti have alternated regarding a possible construction of a new Inter stadium.
 Between June and July 2019, Inter and Milan announced the agreement for the construction of a new shared stadium in the San Siro area. In the winter of 2021, Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, gave official permission for the construction of the new stadium next to San Siro that is expected to be partially demolished and refunctionalised after the 2026 Olympic Games. In early 2022, Inter and Milan revealed a "plan B" to relocate the construction of the new Milano stadium in the Greater Milan, away from the San Siro area.
Supporters and rivalries.
Inter is one of the most supported clubs in Italy, according to an August 2007 research by Italian newspaper "La Repubblica". In the early years (until the First World War), Inter fans from the city of Milan were typically middle class, while Milan fans were typically working class. During Massimo Moratti ownership Inter fans were viewed in a moderate left-political eye. At the same time during Silvio Berlusconi reign, Milan fans were viewed in a moderate/right political eye. Today, these divisions are anachronistic.
The traditional ultras group of Inter is "Boys San"; they hold a significant place in the history of the ultras scene in general due to the fact that they are one of the oldest, being founded in 1969. Politically, one group (Irriducibili) of Inter Ultras are right-wing and this group has good relationships with the Lazio ultras. As well as the main group (apolitical) of "Boys San", there are five more significant groups: "Viking" (apolitical), "Irriducibili" (right-wing), "Ultras" (apolitical), "Brianza Alcoolica" (apolitical) and "Imbastisci" (left-wing).
Inter's most vocal fans are known to gather in the Curva Nord, or north curve of the San Siro. This longstanding tradition has led to the Curva Nord being synonymous with the club's most die-hard supporters, who unfurl banners and wave flags in support of their team.
Inter have several rivalries, two of which are highly significant in Italian football; firstly, they participate in the intracity "Derby della Madonnina" with Milan; the rivalry has existed ever since Inter splintered off from Milan in 1908. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city's main attractions. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the match. Flares are commonly present, but they also led to the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final matchup between Milan and Inter on 12 April, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan keeper Dida on the shoulder.
The other significant rivalry is with Juventus; matches between the two clubs are known as the "Derby d'Italia". Up until the 2006 Italian football scandal, which saw Juventus relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs never to have played below Serie A. In the 2000s, Inter developed a rivalry with Roma, who finished as runners-up to Inter in all but one of Inter's five "Scudetto"-winning seasons between 2005–06 and 2009–10. The two sides have also contested in five Coppa Italia finals and four Supercoppa Italiana finals since 2006. Other clubs, like Atalanta and Napoli, are also considered among their rivals. Their supporters collectively go by "Interisti", or "Nerazzurri."
Honours.
Inter have won 36 domestic trophies, including the Serie A nineteen times, the Coppa Italia nine times and the Supercoppa Italiana eight times. From 2006 to 2010, the club won five successive league title, equalling the all-time record before 2017, when Juventus won the sixth successive league title. They have won the UEFA Champions League three times: two back-to-back in 1964 and 1965 and then another in 2010; the last completed an unprecedented Italian treble with the Coppa Italia and the "Scudetto". The club has also won three UEFA Europa League, two Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup.
Inter has never been relegated from the top flight of Italian football in its entire existence. It is the sole club to have competed in Serie A and its predecessors in every season since its debut in 1909.
Club statistics and records.
Javier Zanetti holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Inter, with 858 official games played in total and 618 in Serie A.
Giuseppe Meazza is Inter's all-time top goalscorer, with 284 goals in 408 games. Behind him, in second place, is Alessandro Altobelli with 209 goals in 466 games, and Roberto Boninsegna in third place, with 171 goals over 281 games.
Helenio Herrera had the longest reign as Inter coach, with nine years (eight consecutive) in charge, and is the most successful coach in Inter history with three "Scudetti", two European Cups, and two Intercontinental Cup wins. José Mourinho, who was appointed on 2 June 2008, completed his first season in Italy by winning the Serie A title and the Supercoppa Italiana; in his second season he won the first "treble" in Italian history: the Serie A, Coppa Italia and the UEFA Champions League.

Corporate.
FC Internazionale Milano S.p.A. was described as one of the financial "black-holes" among the Italian clubs, which was heavily dependent on the financial contribution from the owner Massimo Moratti. In June 2006, the shirt sponsor and the minority shareholder of the club, Pirelli, sold 15.26% shares of the club to Moratti family, for €13.5 million. The tyre manufacturer retained 4.2%. However, due to several capital increases of Inter, such as a reversed merger with an intermediate holding company, Inter Capital S.r.l. in 2006, which held 89% shares of Inter and €70 million capitals at that time, or issues new shares for €70.8 million in June 2007, €99.9 million in December 2007, €86.6 million in 2008, €70 million in 2009, €40 million in 2010 and 2011, €35 million in 2012 or allowing Thoir subscribed €75 million new shares of Inter in 2013, Pirelli became the third largest shareholders of just 0.5%, as of 31 December 2015[ [update]]. Inter had yet another recapitalization that was reserved for Suning Holdings Group in 2016. In the prospectus of Pirelli's second IPO in 2017, the company also revealed that the value of the remaining shares of Inter that was owned by Pirelli, was write-off to zero in 2016 financial year. Inter also received direct capital contribution from the shareholders to cover loss which was excluded from issuing shares in the past. ()
Right before the takeover of Thohir, the consolidated balance sheets of "Internazionale Holding S.r.l." showed the whole companies group had a bank debt of €157 million, including the bank debt of a subsidiary "Inter Brand Srl", as well as the club itself, to Istituto per il Credito Sportivo (ICS), for €15.674 million on the balance sheet at the end of the 2012–13 financial year. In 2006, Inter sold its brand to the new subsidiary, "Inter Brand S.r.l.", a special purpose entity with a shares capital of €40 million, for €158 million (the deal made Internazionale make a net loss of just €31 million in a separate financial statement). At the same time, the subsidiary secured a €120 million loan from Banca Antonveneta, which would be repaid in installments until 30 June 2016; "La Repubblica" described the deal as "doping". In September 2011, Inter secured a loan from ICS by factoring the sponsorship of Pirelli of 2012–13 and 2013–14 season, for €24.8 million, in an interest rate of 3 months Euribor + 1.95% spread. In June 2014, new Inter Group secured €230 million loan from Goldman Sachs and UniCredit at a new interest rate of 3 months Euribor + 5.5% spread, as well as setting up a new subsidiary to be the debt carrier: "Inter Media and Communication S.r.l.". €200 million of which would be utilized in debt refinancing of the group. The €230million loan, €1 million (plus interests) would be due on 30 June 2015, €45 million (plus interests) would be repaid in 15 installments from 30 September 2015 to 31 March 2019, as well as €184 million (plus interests) would be due on 30 June 2019. In ownership side, the Hong Kong-based International Sports Capital HK Limited, had pledged the shares of Italy-based International Sports Capital S.p.A. (the direct holding company of Inter) to CPPIB Credit Investments for €170 million in 2015, at an interest rate of 8% p.a (due March 2018) to 15% p.a. (due March 2020). ISC repaid the notes on 1 July 2016 after they sold part of the shares of Inter to Suning Holdings Group. However, in the late 2016 the shares of ISC S.p.A. was pledged again by ISC HK to private equity funds of OCP Asia for US$80 million. In December 2017, the club also refinanced its debt of €300 million, by issuing corporate bond to the market, via Goldman Sachs as the bookkeeper, for an interest rate of 4.875% p.a.
Considering revenue alone, Inter surpassed city rivals in Deloitte Football Money League for the first time, in the 2008–2009 season, to rank in ninth place, one place behind Juventus in eighth place, with Milan in tenth place. In the 2009–10 season, Inter remained in ninth place, surpassing Juventus (10th) but Milan re-took the leading role as the seventh. Inter became the eighth in 2010–2011, but was still one place behind Milan. Since 2011, Inter fell to 11th in 2011–12, 15th in 2012–13, 17th in 2013–14, 19th in 2014–15 and 2015–16 season. In 2016–17 season, Inter was ranked 15th in the "Money League".
In 2010 "Football Money League" (2008–09 season), the normalized revenue of €196.5 million were divided up between matchday (14%, €28.2 million), broadcasting (59%, €115.7 million, +7%, +€8 million) and commercial (27%, €52.6 million, +43%). Kit sponsors Nike and Pirelli contributed €18.1 million and €9.3 million respectively to commercial revenues, while broadcasting revenues were boosted €1.6 million (6%) by Champions League distribution. Deloitte expressed the idea that issues in Italian football, particularly matchday revenue issues, were holding Inter back compared to other European giants, and developing their own stadia would result in Serie A clubs being more competitive on the world stage.
In the 2009–10 season, the revenue of Inter was boosted by the sales of Ibrahimović, the treble and the release clause of coach José Mourinho. According to the normalized figures by Deloitte in their 2011 "Football Money League", in the 2009–10 season, the revenue had increased €28.3 million (14%) to €224.8 million. The ratio of matchday, broadcasting and commercial in the adjusted figures was 17%:62%:21%.
For the 2010–11 season, Serie A clubs started negotiating club TV rights collectively rather than individually. This was predicted to result in lower broadcasting revenues for big clubs such as Juventus and Inter, with smaller clubs gaining from the loss. Eventually the result included an extraordinary income of €13 million from RAI. In 2012 "Football Money League" (2010–11 season), the normalized revenue was €211.4 million. The ratio of matchday, broadcasting and commercial in the adjusted figures was 16%:58%:26%.
However, combining revenue and cost, in the 2006–07 season they had a net loss of €206 million (€112 million extraordinary basis, due to the abolition of non-standard accounting practice of the special amortization fund), followed by a net loss of €148 million in the 2007–08 season, a net loss of €154 million in 2008–09 season, a net loss of €69 million in the 2009–10 season, a net loss of €87 million in the 2010–11 season, a net loss of €77 million in the 2011–12 season, a net loss of €80 million in the 2012–13 season and a net profit of €33 million in 2013–14 season, due to special income from the establishment of subsidiary Inter Media and Communication. All aforementioned figures were in separate financial statement. Figures from consolidated financial statement were announced since the 2014–15 season, which were net losses of €140.4 million (2014–15), €59.6 million (2015–16 season, before 2017 restatement) and €24.6 million (2016–17).
In 2015, Inter and Roma were the only two Italian clubs that were sanctioned by the UEFA due to their breaking of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations, which was followed by AC Milan which was once barred from returning to European competition in 2018. As a probation to avoid further sanction, Inter agreed to have a three-year aggregate break-even from 2015 to 2018, with the 2015–16 season being allowed to have a net loss of a maximum of €30 million, followed by break-even in the 2016–17 season and onwards. Inter was also fined €6 million plus an additional €14 million in probation.
Inter also made a financial trick in the transfer market in mid-2015, in which Stevan Jovetić and Miranda were signed by Inter on temporary deals plus an obligation to sign outright in 2017, making their cost less in the loan period. Moreover, despite heavily investing in new signings, namely Geoffrey Kondogbia and Ivan Perišić, signings which potentially increased the cost in amortization, Inter also sold Mateo Kovačić for €29 million, making a windfall profit. In November 2018, documents from Football Leaks further revealed that the loan signings such as Xherdan Shaqiri in January 2015, was in fact had inevitable conditions to trigger the outright purchase.
On 21 April 2017, Inter announced that their net loss (FFP adjusted) of the 2015–16 season was within the allowable limit of €30 million. However, on the same day, UEFA also announced that the reduction of squad size of Inter in European competitions would not be lifted yet, due to partial fulfilment of the targets in the settlement agreement. Same announcement was made by UEFA in June 2018, based on Inter's 2016–17 season financial result.
In February 2020, Inter Milan sued Major League Soccer (MLS) for trademark infringement, claiming that the term "Inter" is synonymous with its club and no one else.

Association football club from Turin, Italy
Football club
Juventus Football Club (from , 'youth'; ), colloquially known as Juve (), is an Italian professional football club based in Turin, Piedmont, that competes in the Serie A, the top tier of the Italian football league system. Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed ("the Old Lady"), the club has won 36 official league title, 14 Coppa Italia titles and nine Supercoppa Italiana title, being the records holder for all these competitions; two Intercontinental Cup, two European Cup / UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup, a joint national record of three UEFA Cup, two UEFA Super Cup and a joint national records of one UEFA Intertoto Cup. Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification, whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation title won with eleven trophies, as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking, having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.
Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club, it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006–07 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923. The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs "ante litteram" in the country, having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s, and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, and profit since the mid-1990s, being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.
Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league title and five international title, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976–77 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983–84 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984–85 European Champions' Cup. With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies; an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi, becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association. In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world, and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.
The club's fan base is the largest at national level and one of the largest worldwide. Unlike most European sporting supporters' groups, which are often concentrated around their own club's city of origin, it is widespread throughout the whole country and the Italian diaspora, making Juventus a symbol of "anticampanilismo" ("anti-parochialism") and ("Italianness"). Juventus players have won eight Ballon d'Or awards, four of these in consecutive years (1982–1985, an overall joint record), among these Michel Platini as well as three of the five recipients with Italian nationality as the first player representing Serie A, Omar Sívori, and the former member of the youth sector Paolo Rossi; they have also won four FIFA World Player of the Year awards, with winners as Roberto Baggio and Zinedine Zidane, a national record and third and joint second highest overall, respectively, in the cited prizes. Finally, the club has also provided the most players to the Italy national team—mostly in official competitions in almost uninterrupted way since 1924—who often formed the group that led the "Azzurri" squad to international success, most importantly in the 1934, 1982 and 2006 FIFA World Cup.
History.
Early years (1897–1918).
Juventus was founded as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo d'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, among them Eugenio Canfari and Enrico Canfari. It was renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later. The club joined the 1900 Italian Football Championship. Juventus played their first Italian Football Championship match on 11 March 1900, against Torinese, which finished in a 1–0 defeat.
In 1904, businessman Marco Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances of Juventus, making it possible to transfer the training field from piazza d'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the 1905 Italian Football Championship while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time, the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.
There was a split at the club in 1906 after some of the staff considered moving Juve out of Turin. Alfred Dick, the club's president, was unhappy with this, and left with some prominent players to found FBC Torino, which in turn spawned the "Derby della Mole". Juventus spent much of this period steadily rebuilding after the split, surviving the First World War.
League dominance (1923–1980).
In 1922, a new stadium was inaugurated and, a year later, FIAT vice president Edoardo Agnelli was elected club's president. These two events helped the club to its second league championship in the 1925–26 Prima Divisione, after beating Alba Roma in a two-legged final with an aggregate score of 12–1. The club established itself as a major force in Italian football in the 1930s, becoming the country's first professional club and the first with a decentralised fan base. This led Juventus to win a record of five consecutive Italian football championships and form the core of the Italy national football team during the Vittorio Pozzo era, including the 1934 FIFA World Cup winning squad, with star players like Raimundo Orsi, Luigi Bertolini, Giovanni Ferrari, and Luis Monti, among others. As of 2022, with 27 players, it is the club with the most FIFA World Cup champions.
Juventus moved to the Stadio Comunale, but for the rest of the 1930s and the majority of the 1940s, they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed president. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the club added two more league championships to its name, winning the 1949–50 Serie A under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver, and then repeating in the 1951–52 Serie A. For the 1957–58 Serie A, two new strikers, Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar Sívori, were signed to play alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. In the 1959–60 Juventus F.C. season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning the 1959–60 Serie A and the 1960 Coppa Italia final. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182 goals in all competitions, a club record that stood for 45 years.
During the rest of the decade, the club only won the 1966–67 Serie A. The 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their strong position in Italian football, and under former player Čestmír Vycpálek they won the "scudetto" in the 1971–72 Serie A, and followed through in the 1972–73 Serie A, with players like as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio, and José Altafini breaking through. During the rest of the decade, they won the league thrice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The latter two success in Serie A was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title, the 1976–77 UEFA Cup, and helped the club's domination continue into the early part of the 1980s.

1985 European Cup final starting lineup
The Trapattoni era was highly successful in the 1980s, and the club started the decade off well, winning the league title three more times by 1984. This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles, and were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, becoming the only Italian club to achieve this. Around this time, the club's players were attracting considerable attention, and Paolo Rossi was named European Footballer of the Year following his contribution to Italy's victory in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament.
Frenchman Michel Platini was awarded the European Footballer of the Year title for three years in a row in 1983, 1984 and 1985, which is a record. Juventus are the first (and one of only two clubs) to have players from their club win the award in four consecutive years. It was Platini who scored the winning goal in the 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool; this was marred by the Heysel Stadium disaster, which changed European football. That year, Juventus became the first club in the history of European football to have won all three major UEFA competitions; after their triumph in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup, the club also became the first (and thus far only) in association football history to have won all five possible confederation competitions, an achievement that it revalidated with a sixth title won in the [[1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup]].
With the exception of winning the closely contested [[1985–86 Serie A]], the rest of the 1980s were not very successful for the club. As well as having to contend with [[Diego Maradona]]'s [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], both of the Milanese clubs, [[A.C. Milan]] and [[Inter Milan]], won Italian championships; Juventus achieved a double by winning the [[1989–90 Coppa Italia]] and the [[1990 UEFA Cup final]] under the guidance of former club legend [[Dino Zoff]]. In 1990, Juventus also moved into their new home, the [[Stadio delle Alpi]], which was built for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]. Despite the arrival of Italian star [[Roberto Baggio]] later that year for a [[world football transfer record fee]], the early 1990s under [[Luigi Maifredi]] and subsequently Trapattoni once again also saw little success for Juventus, as they only managed to win the [[1993 UEFA Cup final]].
Renewed international success (1994–2004).

[[1996 UEFA Champions League final]] starting lineup
[[Marcello Lippi]] took over as Juventus manager at the start of the [[1994–95 Serie A]]. His first season at the helm of the club was a successful one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the [[1995 Coppa Italia final]]. The crop of players during this period featured [[Ciro Ferrara]], [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Gianluca Vialli]], and a young [[Alessandro Del Piero]]. Lippi led Juventus to the [[1995 Supercoppa Italiana]] and the [[1995–96 UEFA Champions League]], beating [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] on penalties after a 1–1 draw in which [[Fabrizio Ravanelli]] scored for Juventus.
The club did not rest long after winning the European Cup, as more highly regarded players were brought into the fold, namely [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Filippo Inzaghi]], and [[Edgar Davids]]. At home, Juventus won the [[1996–97 Serie A]], successfully defended their title in the [[1997–98 Serie A]], won the [[1996 UEFA Super Cup]], and followed through with the [[1996 Intercontinental Cup]]. Juventus reached two consecutive [[Champions League finals]] during this period, but lost both games to [[Borussia Dortmund]] and [[Real Madrid CF|Real Modris]], respectively in 1997 and 1998.
After a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi returned to the club in 2001, following his replacement [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s dismissal, signing big name players like [[Gianluigi Buffon]], [[David Trezeguet]], [[Pavel Nedvěd]], and [[Lilian Thuram]], helping the team to win the [[2001–02 Serie A]], which was their first since 1998, and confirmed themselves in the [[2002–03 Serie A]]. Juventus were also part of an all-Italian [[2003 UEFA Champions League final]], but lost that game to Milan on penalties, held after a 0–0 draw. At the conclusion of the following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national team's head coach, bringing an end to one of the most fruitful managerial spells in Juventus's history.
"Calciopoli" scandal (2004–2007).
[[Fabio Capello]] was appointed as Juventus's coach in 2004, and led the club to two more consecutive Serie A first places. In May 2006, Juventus emerged as one of the five clubs linked to the "[[Calciopoli]]" scandal. In July, Juventus was placed at the bottom of the league table and relegated to [[Serie B]] for the first time in its history. The club was also stripped of the [[2004–05 Serie A]] title, while the [[2005–06 Serie A]] winner, after a period "[[sub judice]]", was declared to be third-placed Inter Milan. This remains a much debated and controversial issue, particularly due to Inter Milan's later revealed involvement, the 2004 championship (the sole being investigated) deemed regular and not fixed, Juventus being absolved as club in the ordinary justice proceedings, their renounce to the Italian civil courts appeal, which could have cleared the club's name and avoid relegation, after [[FIFA]] threatened to suspend the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) and barring all Italian clubs from international play, and the motivations, such as "sentimento popolare" (people's feelings), and the newly created "ad-hoc" rule used to relegate the club.
[[File:Super Gigi Buffon (Juventus) (2).jpg|thumb|Star goalkeeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]] was among a group of players who remained with the club following their demotion to Serie B in 2006.]]
Many key players left following their relegation to Serie B, including Thuram, star striker [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]], midfielders [[Emerson (footballer, born 1976)|Emerson]] and [[Patrick Vieira]], and defensive stalwarts [[Fabio Cannavaro]] and [[Gianluca Zambrotta]]; other big name players, such as Del Piero, Buffon, Trezeguet, and Nedvěd, as well as the club's future defense core [[Giorgio Chiellini]], remained to help the club return to Serie A, while youngsters from the [[Campionato Nazionale Primavera]] (youth team), such as [[Sebastian Giovinco]] and [[Claudio Marchisio]], were integrated into the first team. Juventus won the "Cadetti" title (Serie B championship), despite starting with a points deduction and gained promotion straight back to the top division, with Del Piero claiming the top scorer award with 21 goals, as league winners after the [[2006–07 Serie B]] season.
As early as 2010, when many other clubs were implicated and Inter Milan, [[U.S. Livorno 1915|Livorno]], and Milan liable of direct Article 6 violations in the 2011 Palazzi Report, Juventus considered challenging the stripping of their "scudetto" from 2006 and the non-assignment of the 2005 title, dependent on the results of [[Calciopoli trials]] connected to the 2006 scandal. When former general manager [[Luciano Moggi]]'s conviction in criminal court in connection with the scandal was partially written off by the Supreme Court in March 2015, the club sued the FIGC for €443 million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation. Then-FIGC president [[Carlo Tavecchio]] offered to discuss reinstatement of the lost "scudetti" in exchange for Juventus dropping the lawsuit.
In September 2015, the Supreme Court released a 150-page document that explained its final ruling of the case, based on the controversial 2006 sports ruling, which did not take in consideration the other clubs involved because they could not be put on trial due to the statute of limitations, and it would be necessary to request and open a revocation of judgment pursuant to Article 39 of the Code of Sports Justice. Despite his remaining charges being cancelled without a new trial due to statute of limitations, the court confirmed that Moggi was actively involved in the sporting fraud, which was intended to favour Juventus and increase his own personal benefits, according to "[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]". As did the Naples court in 2012, the court commented that the developments and behaviour of other clubs and executives were not investigated in depth. Once they exhausted their appeals in Italy's courts, both Moggi and Giraudo appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in March 2020; Giraudo's was accepted in September 2021. Juventus continued to present new appeals, which were declared inadmissible.
Return to Serie A (2007–2011).
After making their comeback for the [[2007–08 Serie A]], Juventus appointed [[Claudio Ranieri]] as manager. They finished in third place in their first season back in the top flight, and qualified for the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League]]'s third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results, and [[Ciro Ferrara]] was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for the last two games of the [[2008–09 Serie A]], before being subsequently appointed as manager for the [[2009–10 Serie A]].
Ferrara's stint as Juventus manager proved to be unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League]], and also of the [[2009–10 Coppa Italia]], as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table at the end of January 2010, leading to the dismissal of Ferrara and the naming of [[Alberto Zaccheroni]] as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the [[2010–11 Serie A]], [[Jean-Claude Blanc]] was replaced by [[Andrea Agnelli]] as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport [[Alessio Secco]] with [[UC Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] manager [[Luigi Delneri]] and director of sport [[Giuseppe Marotta]]. Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed, and former player and fan favourite [[Antonio Conte]], fresh after winning promotion with [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]], was named as Delneri's replacement. In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new [[Juventus Stadium]], known as the Allianz Stadium since 2017.
Nine consecutive "scudetti" (2011–2020).
[[File:Andrea Pirlo Juventus.jpg|left|thumb|Playmaker [[Andrea Pirlo]] playing for Juventus in 2012]]
With Conte as manager, Juventus were unbeaten for the entire [[2011–12 Serie A]] season. Towards the second half of the season, the team was mostly competing with northern rivals Milan for first place in a tight contest. Juventus won the title on the 37th matchday, after beating [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] 2–0 and Milan losing to Inter 4–2. After a 3–1 win in the final matchday against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], Juventus became the first team to go the season unbeaten in the 38-game format. In [[2013–14 Serie A]], Juventus won a third consecutive "scudetto" with a record 102 points and 33 wins. The title was the 30th official league championship in the club's history. They also achieved the semi-finals of [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League]], where they were eliminated at home against ten-man [[Benfica]]'s "[[catenaccio]]", missing the [[2014 UEFA Europa League final]] at the Juventus Stadium.
[[File:Juventus Coppa Italia 2017.jpg|thumb|Juventus captain [[Giorgio Chiellini]] receiving the [[2016–17 Coppa Italia]] from [[Sergio Mattarella]], the president of Italy]]
In the [[2014–15 Serie A]], [[Massimiliano Allegri]] was appointed as manager, with whom Juventus won their 31st official title, their fourth-straight, as well as won their tenth [[Coppa Italia]], after beating [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] 2–1 in the [[2015 Coppa Italia final]], for the domestic double. The club also beat Real Madrid 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the [[2014–15 UEFA Champions League]], to face [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2015 UEFA Champions League final]] in Berlin, their first Champions League final since the [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|2002–03 season]]. Juventus lost the final against Barcelona 3–1. In the [[2016 Coppa Italia final]], the club won the title for the 11th time (and second consecutively), to become the first team in Italy's history to win the national league and the national cup doubles in back-to-back seasons.
In the [[2017 Coppa Italia final]], Juventus won their 12th Coppa Italia title in a 2–0 win over Lazio, becoming the first team to win three consecutive titles. Four days later on 21 May, Juventus became the first team to win six consecutive Serie A titles. In the [[2017 UEFA Champions League final]], their second Champions League final in three years, Juventus were defeated 1–4 by defending champions Real Madrid. In the [[2018 Coppa Italia final]], Juventus won their fourth consecutive title (and 13th overall), in a 4–0 win over Milan, extending the all-time record of successive Coppa Italia titles. Juventus then secured their seventh consecutive Serie A title, extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition. In the [[2018 Supercoppa Italiana]], which was held in January 2019, Juventus and Milan, who were tied for Supercoppa Italiana wins with seven each, played against each other; Juventus won their eighth title after beating Milan 1–0. In April 2019, Juventus secured their eighth consecutive Serie A title, further extending the all-time record of successive triumphs in the competition. After winning five consecutive "scudetti", Allegri left Juventus, and [[Maurizio Sarri]] was appointed manager of the club ahead of the [[2019–20 Juventus F.C. season]]. Juventus were confirmed [[2019–20 Serie A]] champions, reaching an unprecedented milestone of nine consecutive league titles.
Recent history (2020–present).
On 8 August 2020, Sarri was sacked from his managerial position, one day after [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] eliminated Juventus from the [[2019–20 UEFA Champions League]]. On the same day, former player [[Andrea Pirlo]] was announced as the new coach, signing a two-year contract. In the [[2020 Supercoppa Italiana]], which was held in January 2021, Juventus won their ninth title after a 2–0 victory against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]. With Inter Milan's win of the [[2020–21 Serie A]], Juventus's run of nine consecutive titles came to an end; the club secured a fourth-place finish on the final day of the league, granting Juventus qualification to the following season's Champions League. In the [[2021 Coppa Italia final]], Juventus won their 14th title. On 28 May, Juventus sacked Pirlo from his managerial position, and announced Allegri's return to the club as manager after two years away from management and signed four-year contract. Although Allegri had considered the victory of the "scudetto" as a seasonal goal, Juventus reached another fourth place in the league. After losing 4–2 [[after extra time]] to Inter Milan in the [[2022 Coppa Italia final]], the [[2021–22 Juventus F.C. season]] marked the first season since 2010–11 in which the club had not won a trophy.
In the [[2022–23 Juventus F.C. season|2022–23 season]], Juventus had one victory and five defeats in their Champions League group, achieving their worst-ever score (3 points) and their greatest-ever number of losses in the competition's group stage. Through their better goal difference over fourth-placed [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]], the team finished third and dropped down into the Europa League, in which they were defeated 2–1 by [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] after extra time at the [[Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium]] in the semi-final. On 28 November 2022, the entire board of directors resigned from their respective positions, [[Andrea Agnelli]] as president, [[Pavel Nedvěd]] as vice president, and [[Maurizio Arrivabene]] as CEO. Agnelli's presidency was the one with the most trophies won, 19. [[Exor (company)|Exor]], the club's controlling shareholder, appointed [[Gianluca Ferrero]] as its new chairman ahead of the shareholders' meeting on 18 January 2023.
Two days later, after being acquitted by the FIGC's Court of Appeal in April–May 2022, Juventus were deducted 15 points as punishment for capital gain violations, as part of an investigation (started November 2021) related to the 2019–2021 budgets during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. This was harsher than the point deduction recommended by the FIGC prosecutor, who said that in the standings Juventus "must now finish behind Roma, outside the European Cup area". The penalty caused an uproar and protests among Juventus supporters, who cancelled, or threatened to do so, their [[Sky Sport (Italy)|Sky Sport]] and [[DAZN]] subscriptions. Following Juventus's appeal, the decision had initially been reversed on 20 April 2023, but the club were given a new penalty, this time of ten points, on 22 May. Within the aforementioned FIGC's inquiry, on 29 May, Juventus proposed a [[plea bargain]] for their false accounting on staff salaries; the request was accepted one day later, and Juventus received a fine of €718,240, without any further penalty. Juventus finished the [[2022–23 Serie A]] in seventh place with 62 points, and qualified to the [[UEFA Europa Conference League]]. On 28 July, UEFA, however, ejected Juventus from its competitions for one year, as the club had violated a settlement agreement with UEFA, signed in August 2022. The [[2023–24 Juventus FC season|2023–24 season]] was the first since 2011–12 in which Juventus did not participate in UEFA competitions.
Crest and colours.
Juventus have played in black and white striped shirts, with white shorts, sometimes black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.
Juventus's official emblem has undergone different and small modifications since the 1920s. The previous modification of the Juventus badge took place in 2004, when the emblem of the team changed to a black-and-white [[Shield (heraldry)|oval shield]] of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section the name of the society superimposed on a white [[Convex set|convex section]], over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white silhouette of a [[Cattle|charging bull]] is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black [[Shield (heraldry)|old French shield]] and the charging bull is a symbol of the "[[comune]]" of Turin. There is also a black silhouette of a [[mural crown]] above the black spherical triangle's base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress.
In January 2017, president [[Andrea Agnelli]] announced the change to the Juventus badge for a [[logotype]]. More specifically, it is a [[pictogram]] composed by a stylized Black and White "[[J]]" which Agnelli said reflects "the Juventus way of living." Juventus was the first team in sports history to adopt a [[Star (sport badge)|star]] as a symbol associated with any competition's triumph, who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, and has since become popularized with other clubs as well.
In the past, the convex section of the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and it was [[Concave polygon|concave]] in shape. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower section of the emblem, had a considerably greater size. The two "Golden Stars for Sport Excellence" were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus's emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the blurred silhouette of a zebra, alongside the two golden stars with the club's name forming an arc above.
Juventus unofficially won their 30th league title in 2011–12, but a dispute with the FIGC, which stripped Juventus of their 2004–05 title and did not assign them the 2005–06 title due to their involvement in the "[[Calciopoli]]" scandal, left their official total at 28; the club elected to wear no stars at all the [[2012–13 Serie A|following season]]. Juventus won their 30th title in 2013–14, and thus earned the right to wear their third star, but Agnelli stated that the club suspended the use of the stars until another team wins their 20th championship, having the right to wear two stars "to emphasise the difference". For the [[2015–16 Juventus FC season|2015–16 season]], Juventus reintroduced the stars and added the third star to their jersey as well with new kit manufacturers [[Adidas]], in addition to the Coppa Italia badge for winning their tenth [[2014–15 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] the [[2014–15 Juventus FC season|previous season]]. For the [[2016–17 Juventus FC season|2016–17 season]], Juventus re-designed their kit with a different take on the trademark black and white stripes. For the [[2017–18 Juventus FC season|2017–18 season]], Juventus introduced the "J" shaped logo onto the kits.
In September 2015, Juventus officially announced a new project called JKids for its junior supporters on its website. Along with this project, Juventus also introduced a new mascot to all its fans which is called J. J is a cartoon-designed zebra, black and white stripes with golden edge piping on its body, golden shining eyes, and three golden stars on the front of its neck. J made its debut at [[Juventus Stadium]] on 12 September 2015.
During its history, the club has acquired a number of nicknames, "la Vecchia Signora" (the Old Lady) being the best example. The "old" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus, which means "youth" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The "lady" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed "la Fidanzata d'Italia" (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] immigrant workers (particularly from [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include "[la] Madama" ([[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] for Madam), "i bianconeri" (the black-and-whites), "le zebre" (the zebras) in reference to Juventus's colours. "I gobbi" (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for the team's players. The most widely accepted origin of "gobbi" dates to the fifties, when the "bianconeri" wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.
The official anthem of Juventus is "Juve (storia di un grande amore)", or "Juve (story of a great love)" in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician [[Paolo Belli]] composed in 2007. In 2016, a documentary film called "Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story" was produced by the [[La Villa brothers]] about Juventus. On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a [[docu-series]] called "[[First Team: Juventus]]", which followed the club throughout [[2017–18 Juventus FC season|the season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Netflix]]; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018. On 25 November 2021, an eight-episode docu-series called "[[All or Nothing: Juventus]]", which followed the club throughout [[2020–21 Juventus FC season|the season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Amazon Prime]].
Stadiums.
After the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the "scudetto") and in 1906, years in which they played at the [[Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I|Corso Re Umberto]].
From 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles. At the end of 1933, they began to play at the new [[Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino|Stadio Benito Mussolini]] inaugurated for the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934 World Championships]]. After the Second World War, the stadium was renamed as Stadio Comunale [[Vittorio Pozzo]]. Juventus played home matches at the ground for 57 years, a total of 890 league matches. The team continued to host training sessions at the stadium until July 2003.
From 1990 until the 2005–06 season, the Torinese side contested their home matches at Stadio delle Alpi, built for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, although in very rare circumstances the club played some home games in other stadia, such as [[Stadio Renzo Barbera|Renzo Barbera]] at Palermo, [[Stadio Dino Manuzzi|Dino Manuzzi]] in [[Cesena]] and the [[Stadio Giuseppe Meazza]] in Milan.
In August 2006, Juventus returned to play in the Stadio Comunale, then known as [[Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino|Stadio Olimpico]], after the restructuring of the stadium for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] onward. In November 2008, Juventus announced that they would invest around €120 million to build a new ground, the Juventus Stadium, on the site of delle Alpi. Unlike the old ground, there is not a running track, and, instead, the pitch is only 7.5 metres away from the stands. The capacity is 41,507. Work began during spring 2009, and the stadium was opened on 8 September 2011, ahead of the start of the 2011–12 season. From 1 July 2017, the Juventus Stadium became known commercially as the [[Allianz]] Stadium of Turin, and this was expected to last until 30 June 2030.
Supporters.
Juventus is the most-supported football club in Italy, with over 12 million fans or "[[tifosi]]", which represent approximately 34% of the total Italian football fans, according to a research published in September 2016 by Italian research agency Demos &amp; Pi, as well as one of the most supported football clubs in the world, with over 300 million supporters (41 million in Europe alone), particularly in the Mediterranean countries to which a large number of [[Italian diaspora]] have emigrated. The Torinese side has fan clubs branches across the globe.
Demand for Juventus tickets in occasional home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support in other parts of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]], leading the team to have one of the largest followings in its away matches, more than in Turin itself.
Club rivalries.
[[File:Giuseppe Meazza (Derby d'Italia).jpg|thumb|Scene from the "Derby d'Italia" in 1930]]
Juventus have significant rivalries with two main clubs.
Juventus's traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino; matches between the two sides are known as the "Derby della Mole" (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906, as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff.
Their most high-profile rivalry is with Inter, another big Serie A club located in [[Milan]], the capital of the neighbouring region of [[Lombardy]]. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the "[[Derby d'Italia]]" (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other at the top of the league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the [[Calciopoli]] scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the third most supported clubs in Italy, and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-"Calciopoli", with the return of Juventus to Serie A.
The rivalry with AC Milan is a rivalry between the two most titled and supported teams in Italy. The challenge confronts also two of the clubs with greater basin of supporters, as well as those with the greatest turnover and stock market value in the country. The match-ups between Milan and Juventus, is regarded as the championship of Serie A, and both teams were often fighting for the top positions of the standings, sometimes even decisive for the award of the title. They also have rivalries with [[AS Roma|Roma]], [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]].
Youth programme.
The Juventus youth set-up has been recognised as one of the best in Italy for producing young talents. While not all graduates made it to the first team, many have enjoyed successful careers in the Italian top flight. Under long-time coach [[Vincenzo Chiarenza]], the "Primavera" (under-19) squad enjoyed one of its successful periods, winning all age-group competitions from 2004 to 2006. Like Dutch club Ajax and many [[Premier League]] clubs, Juventus operates several satellite clubs and football schools outside of the country (i.e. United States, Canada, [[Greece]], [[Saudi Arabia]], Australia and [[Switzerland]]), and numerous camps in the local region to expand talent scouting. On 3 August 2018, Juventus founded their professional reserve team, called [[Juventus F.C. Under-23|Juventus U23]] (renamed to Juventus Next Gen in August 2022), playing in [[Serie C]], who won the [[2019–20 Coppa Italia Serie C|Coppa Italia Serie C]] in 2020. In the [[2021–22 UEFA Youth League]], the U19 squad reached the semi-finals, equalling the best-ever placing in the competition for a Serie A team.
The youth system is also notable for its contribution to the Italian national senior and youth teams. 1934 World Cup winner [[Gianpiero Combi]], [[Football at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Gold Medal]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] winner [[Pietro Rava]], [[Giampiero Boniperti]], Roberto Bettega, 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi and, more recently, Claudio Marchisio and Sebastian Giovinco, are a number of former graduates who have gone on to make the first team and full Italy squad.

Chairmen history.
Juventus have had overall 24 [[President (corporate title)|president]]s ( or ) and two administrative committees, some of which have been members of the club's main stakeholder group and elected since the club's foundation by the then "assemblea di soci" (membership assembly) through an [[Annual general meeting|annual meeting]]. Since 1949, they have been often corporate managers that were nominated in charge by the "assemblea degli azionisti" (stakeholders assembly). On top of chairmen, there were several living former presidents, that were nominated as the honorary chairmen ().

Italy's most successful club of the 20th century and the [[Football records in Italy#Most successful clubs overall (1898–present)|most winning]] in the history of [[Football in Italy|Italian football]], Juventus have won the [[Serie A|Italian League Championship]], the country's premier football club competitions and organised by [[Lega Serie A|Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A]] (LNPA), a record 36 times and have the [[Football records in Italy#Consecutive titles|records of consecutive triumphs]] in that tournament (nine, between [[2011–12 Serie A|2011–12]] and [[2019–20 Serie A|2019–20]]). They have also won the [[Coppa Italia]], the country's primary [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination competitions]], a records 14 times, becoming the first team to retain the trophy successfully with their triumph in the 1959–60 season, and the first to win it in three consecutive seasons from the 2014–15 season to the 2016–17 season, going on to win a fourth consecutive title in 2017–18 (also a record). In addition, the club holds the record for [[Supercoppa Italiana]] wins with nine, the most recent coming in [[2020 Supercoppa Italiana|2020]].
Overall, Juventus have won 70 official competitions, [[Football records in Italy#Most successful clubs overall (1898–present)|more]] than any other club in the country: 59 at national level (which is also a record) and 11 at international stage, making them, [[List of UEFA club competition winners#By club|in the latter case]], the second most successful Italian team. The club is sixth in Europe and twelfth in the world with the most international title won officially recognised by their respective [[FIFA Emergency Committee|association football confederation]] and [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA). In [[1976–77 UEFA Cup|1977]], the Torinese side become the first in [[Southern Europe]] to win the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and the first—and only to date—in Italian football history to achieve an international title with a squad composed by national footballers. In [[1992–93 UEFA Cup|1993]], the club won its third competition's trophy, an unprecedented feat in the continent until then, a confederation record for the next [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League|22 years]] and the most for an Italian team. Juventus was also the first club in the country to achieve the title in the [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]], having won the competitions in [[1984 European Super Cup|1984]], and the first European side to win the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] in [[1985 Intercontinental Cup|1985]], since it was restructured by [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA) and [[CONMEBOL|Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol]] (CONMEBOL)'s organizing committee five years beforehand.
The club has earned the distinction of being allowed to wear three [[Star (sport badge)|golden stars]] () on its shirts representing its league victories, the tenth of which was achieved during the 1957–58 season, the 20th in the [[1981–82 Serie A|1981–82 season]] and the 30th in the [[2013–14 Serie A|2013–14 season]]. Juventus were the first Italian team to have achieved [[Double (association football)|the national double]] four times (winning the Italian [[Serie A|top tier division]] and the [[Coppa Italia|national cup]] competitions in the same season), in the 1959–60, 1994–95, 2014–15 and 2015–16 season. In the 2015–16 season, Juventus won the [[2016 Coppa Italia final|Coppa Italia]] for the 11th time and their second-straight title, becoming the first team in Italy's history to complete Serie A and Coppa Italia [[Double (association football)|doubles]] in back-to-back season; Juventus would go on to win another two consecutive doubles in 2016–17 and 2017–18.
Until the first Europa Conference League final in 2022, the club was unique in the world in having won all official confederation competitions and they have received, in recognition to winning [[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|the three major UEFA competitions]]—[[Timeline of association football#1980s|first case]] in the history of the [[UEFA competitions|European football]] and the only one to be reached with the same coach spell— [[The UEFA Plaque]] by the [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA) on 12 July 1988.
The Torinese side was placed seventh in the [[FIFA Club of the Century|FIFA's century ranking]] of the best clubs in the world on 23 December 2000, and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th Century based on a statistical study series by [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics]], the highest for an Italian club in both.
Juventus have been proclaimed [[IFFHS World's Best Club|World's Club Team of the Year]] twice (1993 and 1996) and was ranked in 3rd place—the highest ranking of any Italian club—in the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics#Club World Ranking|All-Time Club World Ranking]] (1991–2009 period) by the IFFHS.

Club statistics and records.
[[File:Alessandro Del Piero 2008 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alessandro Del Piero]] made a record 705 appearances for Juventus, including 478 in Serie A and is the all-time leading goalscorer for the club, with 290 goals.]]
Alessandro Del Piero holds Juventus's official appearance record of 705 appearances. He took over from Gaetano Scirea on 6 April 2008 against [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]]. He also holds the record for Serie A appearances, with 478. Including all official competitions, Del Piero is the all-time leading goalscorer for Juventus (with 290), since joining the club in 1993. Giampiero Boniperti, who was the all-time topscorer since 1961, comes second in all competitions with 182. In the [[1933–34 Serie A|1933–34 season]], [[Felice Borel]] scored 31 goals in 34 appearances, setting the club record for Serie A goals in a single season. Ferenc Hirzer is the club's highest scorer in a single season with 35 goals in 24 appearances in the [[1925–26 Prima Divisione|1925–26 season]]. The most goals scored by a player in a single match is 6, which is also an Italian record. This was achieved by Omar Sívori in a game against Inter in the [[1960–61 Serie A|1960–61 season]].
The first ever official game participated in by Juventus was in the [[1900 Italian Football Championship|Third Federal Football Championship]], the predecessor of Serie A, against [[F.B.C. Torinese|Torinese]] in a Juventus loss 0–1. The biggest victory recorded by Juventus was 15–0 against Cento, in the second round of the [[1926–27 Coppa Italia]]. In the league, Fiorentina and Fiumana were famously on the end of Juventus's biggest championship wins, with both beaten 11–0 in the 1928–29 season. Juventus's heaviest championship defeats came during the 1911–12 and 1912–13 seasons: they were against Milan in 1912 (1–8) and Torino in 1913 (0–8).
The signing of [[Gianluigi Buffon]] in 2001 from [[S.S.D. Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] cost Juventus €52 million (100 billion lire), making it the then-[[List of most expensive association football transfers|most expensive transfer for a goalkeeper]] of all-time until 2018. On 20 March 2016, during the 2015–16 season, Buffon set a new Serie A record in the "Derby della Mole", for the longest period without conceding a goal (974 minutes). On 26 July 2016, Argentine forward [[Gonzalo Higuaín]] became the third highest football transfer of all-time, and highest transfer for an Italian club, at the time, when he was signed by Juventus for €90 million from Napoli. On 8 August 2016, [[Paul Pogba]] returned to his first club, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], for an all-time record for highest football transfer fee of €105 million, surpassing the former record holder [[Gareth Bale]]. The sale of [[Zinedine Zidane]] from Juventus to Real Madrid of Spain in 2001 was the [[world football transfer record]] at the time, costing the Spanish club around €77.5 million (150 billion lire). On 10 July 2018, [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] became the highest ever transfer for an Italian club with his €100 million transfer from Real Madrid. A transfer that turned out to be the worst big-money signing in Juventus history.
 "As of 22 April 2021"
Contribution to the Italy national team.
Overall, Juventus are the club [[Juventus FC and the Italy national football team#List of call-ups of Juventus players to the Italy national major teams|that has contributed the most players]] to the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] in history, being the only Italian club that has contributed players to every Italy national team since the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|2nd FIFA World Cup]]. Juventus have contributed numerous players to Italy's [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] campaigns, these successful periods principally have coincided with two golden ages of the Turin club's history, referred as "Quinquennio d'Oro" (The Golden Quinquennium), from 1931 until 1935, and "Ciclo Leggendario" (The Legendary Cycle), from 1972 to 1986.
Below are a list of Juventus players who represented the Italy national team during World Cup winning tournaments.
Two Juventus players have won the [[FIFA World Cup awards|golden boot]] award at the World Cup with Italy, Paolo Rossi in 1982 and [[Salvatore Schillaci]] in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]. As well as contributing to Italy's World Cup winning sides, two Juventus players Alfredo Foni and Pietro Rava, represented Italy in the gold medal-winning squad at the [[Football at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Olympics]].
Seven Juventus players represented their nation during the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championship]] win for Italy: [[Sandro Salvadore]], [[Ernesto Castano|Ernesto Càstano]] and [[Giancarlo Bercellino]]. and four in the [[UEFA Euro 2020]]: [[Giorgio Chiellini]], [[Leonardo Bonucci]], [[Federico Bernardeschi]] and [[Federico Chiesa]]; a national record.
The Torinese club has also contributed to a lesser degree to the national sides of other nations due to the limitations pre-[[Bosman rule]] (1995).
[[Zinedine Zidane]] and captain [[Didier Deschamps]] were Juventus players when they won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] with [[France national football team|France]], as well as [[Blaise Matuidi]] in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]], and the Argentines [[Ángel Di María]] and [[Leandro Paredes]] in [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]], making Juventus the association football club to have supplied the most FIFA World Cup winners globally (27). Three Juventus players have also won the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] with a nation other than Italy, [[Luis del Sol]] won it in [[1964 European Football Championship|1964]] with [[Spain national football team|Spain]], while the Frenchmen Michel Platini and Zidane won the competition in [[1984 UEFA European Football Championship|1984]] and [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|2000]] respectively.
Financial information.
Founded as an [[Club (organization)|association]], in 1923, during the [[Edoardo Agnelli (entrepreneur, born 1892)|Edoardo Agnelli]] presidency, the club, at the time ruled by an "assemblea di soci" (membership assembly), became one of the first in the country to acquire [[Professionalism in association football|professional status]] "[[wikt:ante litteram|ante litteram]]", starting also the longest and most uninterrupted society in [[Sport in Italy|Italian sports]] history between a club and a private investor. Juventus was [[restructuring|restructured]] as the football section of [[Sport club|multisports]] [[Holding company|parent company]] Juventus – Organizzazione Sportiva S.A. since the constitution of the later in that year to 1943, when it was [[Mergers and acquisitions|merged]] with another three Torinese enterprises for founding the [[Cisitalia|Compagnia Industriale Sportiva Italia]] (CISITALIA).

In the early 1920s, Juventus expanded its sports involvement, led by President Edoardo Agnelli. This led to the creation of Juventus Organizzazione Sportiva Anonima, which participated in various national championships, in disciplines such as bowls, swimming, ice hockey, and tennis, until its dissolution after [[World War II]], with tennis being the most successful. Juventus achieved its greatest successes with the tennis section. In the late 1960s, a skiing section named Sporting Club "Juventus" was established, based in [[Castagneto Po]] and active throughout the following decade.
In the 2017–2018 season, Juventus established a women's football section, with a team in the Serie A women's championship. The Women's team won the league in their debut season, mirroring the achievement of the men's team, and becoming the first Italian club to hold both major national football championships, male and female, simultaneously. This success continued for the next two seasons.

Football club in Cremona, Italy
Football club
Unione Sportiva Cremonese, commonly referred to as Cremonese, is an Italian football club based in Cremona, Lombardy, which plays in the Serie B following their relegation from the top flight in the 2022–23 season.
History.
Cremonese was in the Serie A in its first season, 1929–30, but entered a long period of decline, languishing in the lower leagues before the late 1970s. By 1984, they had achieved promotion to Serie A, with one-year spells in 1984–85, 1989–90 and 1991–92.
Cremonese had a successful run in the 1992–93 Anglo-Italian Cup, beating Bari 4–1 in the semi-final, and Derby County 3–1 in the final at the old Wembley Stadium, Cremonese's scorers were Corrado Verdelli, Riccardo Maspero and Andrea Tentoni, with Derby's goal scored by Marco Gabbiadini.
Under Luigi Simoni, Cremonese returned to Serie A in the 1993–94 season. With a side containing quality in the form of defenders Luigi Gualco and Corrado Verdelli, midfield playmaker Riccardo Maspero and forwards Andrea Tentoni and Matjaž Florijančič, Cremonese held their own in Serie A with a 10th-place finish in 1993–94, but would be relegated in the 1995–96 season.
Relegation resulted in the club moving down to Serie C2 by 2000 and remaining in mid-table positions for four years, before achieving promotion back into Serie C1 and then Serie B for the 2005-2006 season. Giovanni Dall'Igna, another defender from the Serie A years, returned to the club. However, Cremonese were relegated to Serie C1 in the 2005–06 season. Cremonese have tried to return to Serie B since: they had a good attempt in the 2009–10 season, when they were beaten by Varese in the promotion play-off final (2–1 on aggregate). Eventually they succeeded in 2017. In the 2021–22 Serie B, Cremonese finished second to earn promotion to the 2022–23 Serie A. Despite achieving promotion, coach Fabio Pecchia resigned from his post.

AC Milan

Italian association football club
Football club
 (), commonly referred to as AC Milan () or simply Milan, is an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Founded in 1899, the club competes in the Serie A, the top tier of Italian football, and has spent its entire history there with the exception of the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons.
Domestically, AC Milan has won 19 league titles, making it the second most successful club in the Serie A together with city rivals Inter Milan. The club has also won 5 Coppa Italia titles and 7 Supercoppa Italiana titles. In international competitions, Milan's 18 FIFA and UEFA trophies is the third highest out of any club in the world (joint with Boca Juniors and Independiente), and the most out of any Italian club. Milan has won seven European Cup/Champions League titles, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.
In its early history, Milan played its home games in different grounds around the city before moving to its current stadium, the San Siro, in 1926. The stadium, which was built by Milan's second chairman, Piero Pirelli and has been shared with Inter Milan since 1947, is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of 75,817. AC Milan has a long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, one of the most followed derbies in football.
The club is one of the wealthiest in Italian and world football. It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club Association.
History.
Foundation and early years (1899–1950).
AC Milan was founded as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club in 1899 by English expatriate Herbert Kilpin. The club claims 16 December of that year as their foundation date, but historical evidence seems to suggest that the club was actually founded a few days earlier, most likely on 13 December. However, with the club's charter being lost, the exact date remains open to debate.
In honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the city's name, as opposed to the Italian spelling Milano, which it was forced to bear under the fascist regime. Milan won its first Italian championship in 1901, interrupting a three-year hegemony of Genoa, and a further two in succession in 1906 and 1907. The club proved successful in the first decade of its existence, with several important trophies won, including, among others, the "Medaglia del Re" three times, the "Palla Dapples" 23 times and the "FGNI tournament" five times, a competition organized by the Italian Gymnastics Federation but not officially recognized by the Italian Football Federation.
In 1908, Milan experienced a split caused by internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players, which led to the forming of another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale. Following these events, Milan did not manage to win a single domestic title until 1950–51, with some exceptions represented by the 1915–16 "Coppa Federale" and the 1917–18 "Coppa Mauro", two tournaments played during the First World War which, especially the former, received a lot of attention and proved to be highly competitive, despite them not being officially recognized by the Italian federation.
Return to victory and international affirmation (1950–1970).
The 1950s saw the club return to the top of Italian football, headed by the famous Gre-No-Li Swedish trio Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. This was one of the club's most successful periods domestically, with the Scudetto going to Milan in 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1959. This decade witnessed also the first European successes of Milan, with the triumphs in the 1951 and 1956 Latin Cup. Milan was also the first Italian club to take part in the newly born European Cup in the 1955–56 season, and reached the final two years later, when they were defeated by Real Madrid.
The 1960s began with the debut of Milan's legend Gianni Rivera in 1960: he would remain with the club for the rest of his career, for the following 19 seasons. In 1961, Nereo Rocco was appointed as new coach of the club, which under his leadership won immediately a "scudetto" in 1961–62, followed, in the next season, by Milan's first European Cup triumph, achieved after beating Benfica in the final. This success was repeated in 1969, with a 4–1 win over Ajax in the final, which was followed by the Intercontinental Cup title the same year. During this period Milan also won its ninth scudetto, its first Coppa Italia, with victory over Padova in the 1967 final, and two European Cup Winners' Cups: in 1967–68 and 1972–73.
10th "Scudetto" and decline (1970–1986).
Domestically, the 1970s were characterized by the pursuit of the 10th Serie A title, which grants the winner the "Scudetto" star. For three years in a row, in 1971, 1972 and 1973, Milan ended up second in the league, after some memorable duels with Inter and Juventus. Finally, the achievement was reached in 1979. The same year saw the retirement of Gianni Rivera and the debut of Franco Baresi, at his first full season with the club.
After this success, the team went into a period of decline. The club in 1980 was involved in the Totonero scandal and as punishment was relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history. The scandal was centred around a betting syndicate paying players and officials to fix the outcome of matches. Milan achieved promotion back to Serie A at the first attempt, winning the 1980–81 Serie B title, but were again relegated a year later as the team ended its 1981–82 campaign in third-last place. In 1983, Milan won the Serie B title for the second time in three seasons to return to Serie A, where they achieved a sixth-place finish in 1983–84.
Berlusconi's ownership and international wins (1986–2012).
On 20 February 1986, entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi (who owned Fininvest and Mediaset) acquired the club and saved it from bankruptcy after investing vast amounts of money, appointing rising manager Arrigo Sacchi at the helm of the "Rossoneri" and signing Dutch internationals Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard. The Dutch trio added an attacking impetus to the team, and complemented the club's Italian internationals Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Roberto Donadoni. Under Sacchi, Milan won its first Scudetto in nine years in the 1987–88 season. The following year, the club won its first European Cup in two decades, beating Romanian club Steaua București 4–0 in the final. Milan retained their title with a 1–0 win over Benfica a year later and was the last team to win back-to-back European Cups until Real Madrid's win in 2017. The Milan team of 1988–1990, nicknamed the "Immortals" in the Italian media, has been voted the best club side of all time in a global poll of experts conducted by "World Soccer" magazine.
After Sacchi left Milan in 1991, he was replaced by the club's former player Fabio Capello whose team won three consecutive Serie A titles between 1992 and 1994, a spell which included a 58-match unbeaten run in Serie A (which earned the team the label "the Invincibles"), and back-to-back UEFA Champions League final appearances in 1993, 1994 and 1995. A year after losing 1–0 to Marseille in the 1993 Champions League final, Capello's team reached its peak in one of Milan's most memorable matches of all time, a famous 4–0 win over Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final. Capello's side went on to win the 1995–96 league title before he left to manage Real Madrid in 1996. In 1998–99, after a two-year period of decline, Milan lifted its 16th championship in the club's centenary season.
Milan's next period of success came under another former player, Carlo Ancelotti. After his appointment in November 2001, Ancelotti took Milan to the 2003 Champions League final, where they defeated Juventus on penalties to win the club's sixth European Cup. The team then won the Scudetto in 2003–04, before reaching the 2005 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Liverpool on penalties, despite leading 3–0 at half-time. Two years later, the two teams met again in the 2007 Champions League final, with Milan winning 2–1 to lift the title for a seventh time. The team then won its first FIFA Club World Cup in December 2007. In 2009, after becoming Milan's second longest serving manager with 420 matches overseen, Ancelotti left the club to take over as manager at Chelsea.
During this period, the club was involved in the "Calciopoli" scandal, where five teams were accused of fixing matches by selecting favourable referees. A police inquiry excluded any involvement of Milan managers; the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) unilaterally decided that it had sufficient evidence to charge Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani. As a result, Milan was initially punished with a 15-point deduction and was banned from the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. An appeal saw that penalty reduced to eight points, which allowed the club to retain its Champions League participation.
Following the aftermath of Calciopoli, local rivals Internazionale dominated Serie A, winning four Scudetti. However, with the help a strong squad boasting players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Robinho and Alexandre Pato joining many of the veterans of the club's mid-decade European successes, Milan recaptured the Scudetto in the 2010–11 Serie A season, their first since the 2003–04 season and 18th overall.
Changes in ownership and decline (2012–2019).
After their 18th Scudetto, the club declined in performance. Milan failed to qualify to European competitions for a few years, and the only trophy won was the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana, achieved under Vincenzo Montella's coaching after defeating Juventus in the penalty shoot-out.
On 5 August 2016, a new preliminary agreement was signed with the Chinese investment management company Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Co., to which Fininvest sold a 99.93% stake of Milan for about €520 million, plus the refurbishment of the club financial debt of €220 million. On 13 April 2017, the deal was completed and Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux became the new direct parent company of the club. In order to finalise the deal, American hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation provided Li with a loan of €303 million (€180 million to complete the payment to Fininvest and €123 million issued directly to the club). On 10 July 2018, Li failed to keep up with his loan repayment plan, neglecting to deposit a €32 million instalment on time in order to refinance the €303 million loan debt owed to the American hedge fund. As a result, In July 2018, chairman Li Yonghong's investment vehicle Rossoneri Champion Inv. Lux. was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux., the direct parent company of the club, making the investment vehicle majority controlled by Elliott Management Corporation the sole shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux.
On 27 November 2017, Montella was sacked due to poor results and replaced by former player Gennaro Gattuso. Milan qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage after finishing 6th in the 2017–18 Serie A season, but were banned by UEFA from European competition due to violations of Financial Fair Play regulations for failure to break-even. Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the decision was overturned on 20 July 2018.
In Gattuso's first full season in charge, Milan exceeded expectations and spent much of the campaign in the top 4. Despite winning their final 4 games, Milan missed out on the Champions League by one point. After Milan's failure to qualify for the Champions League, Gattuso resigned as manager. On 19 June 2019, Milan hired former Sampdoria manager Marco Giampaolo on a 2-year contract. On 28 June 2019, Milan was excluded from the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League for violating Financial Fair Play regulations for the years 2014–2017 and 2015–2018.
Recent history (2019–present).
After four months in charge, Giampaolo was sacked after losing four of his first seven games, which was exacerbated by poor performances and a lack of supporter confidence. Stefano Pioli was hired as his replacement. After the restart of the Serie A campaign due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Milan went on a ten-match unbeaten streak, winning seven in the process, including matches against Juventus, Lazio and Roma. This streak led to Milan abandoning their plans to hire Ralf Rangnick as their new manager and sporting director, and instead extended Pioli's contract for a further two years. Following a stellar start in the 2020–21 Serie A, which was a continuation of the second half of the previous season, Milan under Pioli in his first full season were led to a second-place finish in the league, which was the highest finish for the team since the 2011–12 Serie A. This result allowed Milan to qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League for the following season, which would become their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League in seven years, since their last appearance in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League.
Milan secured their nineteenth Italian championship title in the last round of the 2021–22 season, with a club-record tally of 86 points. It was their first league title since the 2010–11 season. In the Serie A Awards, Rafael Leão was named as the league's most valuable player, Mike Maignan as the best goalkeeper, and Pioli as coach of the season. On 1 June 2022, RedBird Capital Partners agreed to acquire AC Milan at $1.3 billion; meanwhile, Elliott Management Corporation would keep a minority stake.
Colours and badge.
Red and black are the colours which have represented the club throughout its entire history. They were chosen by its founder Herbert Kilpin to represent the players' fiery ardour (red) and their opponents' fear of challenging the team (black). "Rossoneri", the team's widely used nickname, literally means "the red &amp; blacks" in Italian, in reference to the colours of the stripes on its jersey.
Another nickname derived from the club's colours is "the Devil". An image of a red devil was used as Milan's logo at one point with a "Golden Star for Sport Excellence" located next to it. As is customary in Italian football, the star above the logo was awarded to the club after winning 10 league titles, in 1979. The official Milan logos have always displayed the Flag of Milan, which was originally the flag of Saint Ambrose, next to red and black stripes. The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the "Comune di Milano", with the acronym "ACM" at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom. For what concerns the badge worn on match kits, from the origins to the mid-1940s it was simply the flag of Milan. For many decades no club logo was displayed, with the exception of the devil's logo in the early 1980s. The club badge made its definitive appearance on the match strips in the 1995–96, in a form that remained basically unchanged until present days.
Since its foundation, the AC Milan home kit consisted of a red and black striped shirt, combined with white shorts and black socks; over the course of the decades, only cyclical changes dictated by the fashions of the time affected this pattern, which remained almost unchanged up to present days. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Rossoneri's first kit was a simple silk shirt characterized by thin stripes, with the badge of the city of Milan sewn at heart level. From the 1910s, the stripes were enlarged following a pattern that would remain unchanged until the late 1950s. The 1960s marked a return to the origins, with the use of thin stripes. This style would last until the 1985–86 season, with a small intermezzo from 1980 to 1982, when the stripes changed to a middle size again. A notable innovation occurred in this period. Between the 1979–80 and 1980–81 seasons, the AC Milan shirt achieved an important record by adding the surnames of the players above the number for the first time in Italian football.
From the 1986–87 season, under the impulse of the new club owner Silvio Berlusconi, the stripes were brought back to a middle size, and the colour of the socks was changed to white, taking the same colour of the shorts. In such a way, Berlusconi aimed at giving the players a more elegant look, as well as making the kit more distinguishably "red and black" when watched on the television compared to the thin striped kit, which, at a distance and on the television, could be mistaken for a full red or brown shirt. This style continued until 1998. Starting from the 1998–99 season, the kits started to be modified on a yearly basis in their design.
Milan's away kit has always been completely white, sometimes adorned with various types of decorations, the most common of which are one vertical or horizontal red and black stripe. The white away kit is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, due to the fact that Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to Ajax in 1995 and Liverpool in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red trimmings.
Anthem and mascot.
"AC Milan Anthem – Milan Milan" debuted in 1988 and was composed by Tony Renis and Massimo Guantini.
The official mascot, designed by Warner Bros., is "Milanello", a red devil with the AC Milan kit and a ball.
Stadiums.
Milan played their first matches at the "Trotter" pitch, located where the Milan Central railway station would later be built. It could not be defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no other facilities. In 1903, Milan moved to the "Acquabella" pitch, where the stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose. Milan played there until 1905. The following year, the club moved to the "Porta Monforte" pitch, where they played until 1914. The stadium was furnished with a ticket office and wooden stands. In the following years, Milan played at the "Velodromo Sempione" (from 1914 to 1920), and at the "Viale Lombardia" stadium (from 1920 to 1926). The latter was a modern structure, with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the Italy national football team.
In 1926, Milan moved to the stadium where they still play nowadays: The San Siro.
The stadium, - officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, after the former player who represented both Milan and Internazionale - has 75,923 seats. The more commonly used name, "San Siro", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took &lt;templatestyles src="Fraction/styles.css" /&gt;13+1⁄2 months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and has been shared with Internazionale since 1947, when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant.
The first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6–3 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008, its capacity was reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by UEFA.
Based on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of its stands to the pitch. The frequent use of flares by supporters contributes to the atmosphere, but the practice has occasionally caused problems.
On 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director Adriano Galliani announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation. He stated Milan's new stadium would be largely based on the Veltins-Arena – the home of Schalke 04 in Gelsenkirchen – and would follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in Portello, behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square "Piazza Gino Valle". The new village with shopping malls and hotel is located near CityLife district and is served by the metro. On 20 September 2015, however, Silvio Berlusconi called an end to his club's plans to build a new stadium in the city. In 2017, new CEO Marco Fassone stated that the club may look at either staying in the San Siro or moving to a new stadium, with the club hierarchy emphasising the need to increase average attendance for home games.
On 27 September 2023, chairman Paolo Scaroni announced the club had filed a proposal to build a new 70,000-seater stadium, alongside the club headquarters and museum in the comune of San Donato Milanese, a suburb south of Milan.
Supporters.
Milan is one of the most supported football clubs in Italy, according to research conducted by Italian newspaper "La Repubblica". Historically, Milan was supported by the city's working class, which granted them the nickname of (which in Milanese dialect means "screwdrivers"), used until the 1960s. On the other hand, crosstown rivals Inter Milan were mainly supported by the more prosperous middle class. The oldest ultras groups in all of Italian football, "Fossa dei Leoni", originated in Milan. Currently, the main ultras group within the support base is "Brigate Rossonere". Milan ultras have never had any particular political preference, but the media traditionally associated them with the left wing until recently, when Berlusconi's presidency somewhat altered that view.
According to a study from 2010, Milan is the most supported Italian team in Europe and seventh overall, with over 18.4 million fans. It had the thirteenth highest average attendance of European football clubs during the 2019–20 season, behind Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid,
Inter, Schalke 04, Tottenham Hotspur, Celtic, Atlético Madrid, West Ham United and Arsenal.
Club rivalries.
Milan's main rivalry is with its neighbour club, Inter Milan. Both clubs meet in the widely anticipated Derby della Madonnina twice every Serie A season. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city's main attractions. The first match was held in the final of the Chiasso Cup of 1908, a football tournament played in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, on 18 October of that year; the Rossoneri won 2–1. The rivalry reached its highest point in the 1960s, when the two clubs dominated the scene both domestically and internationally. In Italy they cumulatively won five Serie A titles, while internationally they collected four European cups. On the bench, the rivalry showcased the clash of two different approaches to Catenaccio by the two managers: Nereo Rocco for Milan and Helenio Herrera for Inter. On the pitch, the stage was taken by some of the biggest stars the Italian Serie A could offer: players such as Gianni Rivera, Giovanni Trapattoni and José Altafini for Milan and Sandro Mazzola, Giacinto Facchetti and Luis Suárez (footballer, born 1935) for Inter. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game. Flares are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan goalkeeper Dida on the shoulder.
The rivalry with Juventus FC is a rivalry between the two most titled teams in Italy. The challenge confronts also two of the clubs with the greater basin of supporters, as well as those with the greatest turnover and stock market value in the country. Milan and Juventus were often fighting for the top positions of the Serie A standings. Some important periods marked by this rivalry were the early 1950s, which saw the two teams alternating each other as Serie A champions (the two clubs won seven titles in the decade), and big duels between forwards, with the Swedish Gre-No-Li on the "rossoneri" side and the trio formed by Giampiero Boniperti, John Hansen and Karl Aage Præst on the "bianconeri" side; the early 1970s, when for two consecutive seasons, 1971-72 and 1972-73, Milan lost the "scudetto" to Juventus by just one point; the 1990s, when the two clubs dominated the league by winning eight (consecutive) titles out of ten, lining up players that marked the history of football in their era and in the whole history; and finally in the 2000s, when, between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons, the two clubs contested each other the Serie A titles, both won by Juventus but then revoked due to the Calciopoli scandal. The only match played by the two teams in European competitions was the 2003 UEFA Champions League final, the first such final between two Italian clubs, won by Milan at the penalties, which granted Milan the sixth Champions League title of their history.
The rivalry with Genoa started at the dawn of the 20th century, when the two clubs repeatedly faced each other for the Italian championship and other important trophies of the time. It then continued in the 1981-82 Serie A season, when Genoa avoided relegation in Naples just a few minutes from the final whistle of the last game of the season, condemning the "Rossoneri" to the second Serie B season of their history. The rivalry worsened in 1995 after Genoa fan Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death by a Milan supporter. Milan also have rivalries with Fiorentina, Atalanta and Napoli.
Popular culture.
In the movie industry, among the films dedicated to the "Rossoneri" team is "Sunday Heroes" (1953), by director Mario Camerini, in which the main plot pivots around a fictional football match between the Rossoneri and a club on the brink of relegation. In the film appear, in addition to the coach Lajos Czeizler, many of the Milan players of the time, including Lorenzo Buffon, Carlo Annovazzi and the Gre-No-Li trio.
Milan as a fan base and some of their most popular players appeared in several Italian comedy movies. Among them, the following are worth mentioning: Eccezzziunale... veramente, (whose cast includes Paolo Maldini, Gennaro Gattuso, Massimo Ambrosini, Dida, Andriy Shevchenko and Alessandro Costacurta) and Tifosi (whose cast includes Franco Baresi).
Milan TV.
On 16 December 1999, on the day of the centenary of the club's foundation, Milan Channel was launched. The subscription-based television channel broadcasts news, events and vintage matches of the club. It is the first Italian thematic channel entirely dedicated to a football team. On 1 July 2016, the channel took on the new name of "Milan TV", renewing its graphics and logo.
"Forza Milan!".
In the editorial field, "Forza Milan!" was the official magazine of the club for over half a century. It was founded in 1963 by journalist Gino Sansoni and published by Panini. Issued with a monthly cadence, it covered all events surrounding Milan, including interviews with its protagonists, special posters, reports of official and friendly matches. Under the direction of Gigi Vesigna it reached a monthly circulation of 130,000 copies. The last issue of the magazine was published in June 2018.
Honours.
With a total of 31 domestic honours, Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italy. The club won its first Serie A title in 1901 with its most recent coming in 2022. Milan's tenth "scudetto" win, in the 1978–79 season meant that it earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition of this.
Milan is the most successful Italian club in international football with their 18 international trophies. They have won the European Cup/Champions League seven times, an Italian record and only surpassed by Real Madrid, with their most recent coming in 2007. Milan's fifth European Cup win, in 1994, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently, and is allowed to display a multiple-winner badge on its shirt. The club also holds a joint record of five wins in the UEFA Super Cup, and a joint record of three wins in the Intercontinental Cup. In 2007, Milan won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, completing an international treble of Champions League, Super Cup and Club World Cup.
Club statistics and records.
Paolo Maldini holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Milan, with 902 official games played in total and 647 in Serie A (as of 31 May 2009, not including playoff matches), the latter being an all-time Serie A record.
Swedish forward Gunnar Nordahl scored 38 goals in the 1950–51 season, 35 of which were in Serie A, setting an Italian football and club record. He went on to become Milan's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 221 goals for the club in 268 games. He is followed in second place by Andriy Shevchenko with 175 goals in 322 games, and Gianni Rivera in third place, who has scored 164 goals in 658 games. Rivera is also Milan's youngest ever goalscorer, scoring in a league match against Juventus at just 17 years.
Legendary tactician Nereo Rocco, the first proponent of "catenaccio" in the country, was Milan's longest-serving manager, sitting on the bench for over nine years (in two spells) in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning the club's first European Cup triumphs. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who purchased the club in 1986, is Milan's longest-serving president (23 years, due to a two-year vacancy between 2004 and 2006).
The first official match in which Milan participated was in the Third Federal Football Championship, the predecessor of Serie A, losing 3–0 to Torinese. Milan's largest ever victory was 13–0 against Audax Modena, in a league match at the 1914–15 season. Its heaviest defeat was recorded in the league at the 1922–23 season, beaten 0–8 by Bologna.
During the 1991–92 season, the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only Perugia had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season (1978–79), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0–0 draw against Parma on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1–0 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993. This is a Serie A record, as well as the third-longest unbeaten run in top flight European football, coming in behind Steaua București's record of 104 unbeaten games and Celtic's 68 game unbeaten run.
Since 2007, along with Boca Juniors, Milan has won more FIFA recognised international club titles than any other club in the world with 18 titles. They were overtaken by Al Ahly SC, from Egypt, after that club's 2014 CAF Confederation Cup win.
The sale of Kaká to Real Madrid in 2009 broke the eight-year-old world football transfer record held by Zinedine Zidane, costing the Spanish club €67 million (about £56 million). That record, however, lasted for less than a month, broken by Cristiano Ronaldo's £80 million transfer. This record, however, is in terms of nominal British pound rates, not adjusted to inflation or the real value of the euro. Madrid bought Zidane for €77.5 million in 2001, about £46 million at that time.

Chairmen and managers.
Chairmen history.
Milan has had numerous chairmen over the course of its history. Here is a complete list of them.
Managerial history.
Below is a list of Milan managers from 1900 until the present day.
AC Milan as a company.
On 13 April 2017, Milan became a subsidiary of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg, which acquired 99.9% shares of AC Milan S.p.A. from Fininvest. Li Yonghong became the new chairman and Marco Fassone was confirmed as CEO. Li Yonghong's investment vehicle was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg after defaulting to Elliott Management Corporation, which lent a large sum of money to Li to finalise the acquisition. Other partners of Elliott were Arena Investors and Blue Skye, according to news reports. Elliott nominated a new board of directors for both Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg and Milan, with Paolo Scaroni as the new chairman () of the board of Milan. The four previous Chinese members of the board, and former CEO, Marco Fassone, were all dismissed.
According to "The Football Money League" published by consultants Deloitte, in the 2005–06 season, Milan was the fifth-highest earning football club in the world, with an estimated revenue of €233.7 million. However, it fell to twelfth in the 2013–14 season. The club is also ranked as the eighth-wealthiest football club in the world by "Forbes" magazine as of 2014[ [update]], making it the wealthiest in Italian football, just surpassing ninth-ranked Juventus by a narrow margin.
Emirates has been the current main sponsor for Milan's shirt, having started since the 2010–11 season. Previously, German car manufacturer Opel (owned by General Motors) had sponsored Milan for 12 seasons. For most of those 12 years, "Opel" was displayed on the front of the shirt, but in the 2003–04 and the 2005–06 seasons respectively, "Meriva" and "Zafira" (two cars from the company's range) were displayed.
The current shirts are supplied by Puma. Previously, kits were supplied by German sportswear manufacturer Adidas, whose deal was scheduled to run until 2023. The deal made Adidas the official manufacturer of all kits, training equipment and replica outfits. However, an early termination of the deal was announced in October 2017, effective on 30 June 2018. Prior to Adidas, the Italian sports company Lotto produced Milan's sportswear.
As a consequence of the aggregate 2.5-year financial result in the reporting periods ending at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 30 June 2017 (a FFP-adjusted net loss of €146 million, €121 million in excess of the acceptable deviation in the regulation), Milan was initially banned from European competitions due to breach in UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations. However, the European ban was lifted by an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Milan was allowed to achieve the break even condition on or before 30 June 2021.
Note: Re-capitalization figures were obtained from item "versamenti soci in conto capitale e/o copertura perdite", for 2006 to 2017 financial year
Superleague Formula.
Milan took part in three editions of the Superleague Formula, from 2008 to 2010. This car competition involved the participation of professional racing teams sponsored by international football teams. The Rossoneri supported the Dutch team Scuderia Playteam in the first season, then Azerti Motorsport in 2009 and the Atech Grand Prix in 2010. The team took several victories and pole positions, and finished third in the final standings of the 2008 championship with Robert Doornbos, former Minardi and Red Bull driver in the Formula 1 World Championship, as main driver. In the same year, Doornbos achieved his team's first victory at the Nürburgring circuit in Germany. Giorgio Pantano drove for Milan in the 2009 season and he has also won races for the team.

Football club in Turin, Italy
Football club
Torino Football Club (), commonly referred to as Torino or simply Toro, is an Italian professional football club based in Turin, Piedmont. They currently play in Serie A. Founded as "Foot-Ball Club Torino" in 1906, Torino are among the most successful clubs in Italy with seven league titles, including five consecutive league titles during the 1940s. The "Grande Torino", as the team was known, was widely recognised as one of the strongest footballing sides of the period, until the entire team was killed in the 1949 Superga air disaster. They have also won the Coppa Italia five times, the last of which was in the 1992–93 season. Internationally, Torino won the Mitropa Cup in 1991 and were finalists in the UEFA Cup in 1991–92.
Torino plays all of its home games at the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino (also known as the Stadio Comunale "Vittorio Pozzo" until 2006). The club's traditional colour is maroon, and its symbol is a rampant bull, the traditional symbol of the city of Turin, from which the club's nickname "Il Toro" (The Bull) is derived. Torino have a local rivalry with Juventus and the two sides contest the Derby della Mole.
History.
The foundation and first steps.
Football first arrived in the city of Turin at the end of the 19th century, introduced by the industrial Swiss and English. By 1887, "Football &amp; Cricket Club" – the oldest Italian football club – had already been founded in the capital of Piedmont, followed in 1889 by "Nobili Torino". In 1891 the two clubs merged to form Internazionale Torino, after which Football Club Torinese was founded in 1894.
The new game quickly supplanted the popularity of pallapugno, which led to the foundation of the football sections of the sports clubs Ginnastica Torino and Juventus. On 8 May 1898 Internazionale Torino, Football Club Torinese and Ginnastica Torino, along with Genoa as part of the International Exhibition for the fiftieth anniversary of the Statuto Albertino gave birth to the first Italian Football Championship.
In 1900, Football Club Torinese absorbed Internazionale Torino, and on 3 December 1906 at the Voigt brewery (now bar Norman) on Via Pietro Micca an alliance was formed with a group of Juventus dissidents, led by the Swiss financier Alfred Dick. Through the merger of Football Club Torinese and the aforementioned group, "Foot-Ball Club Torino" was formed. The first official match was played on 16 December 1906 in Vercelli against Pro Vercelli, won 3–1 by Torino.
The first derby was played in the new year, dated 13 January 1907, in which Torino defeated Juventus 2–1. Torino successfully replicated this by a margin of 4–1 a month later and gained the right to enter the final round of the Italian Football Championship, placed second behind Milan.
Torino did not participate in the 1908 Italian Football Championship as a rule was passed which limited the use of foreign players. The club instead played in two popular "minor" tournaments: the coveted "Palla Dapples" (a silver trophy in the shape of a regulation football), won against Pro Vercelli; and an international tournament organised by La Stampa, which took place in Turin that year. Torino lost in the final to Swiss side Servette.
In 1915, Torino were denied their first real championship attempt by the outbreak of World War I. With one match left to play, Torino (in second), were two points behind leaders Genoa. In the final game of the championship, Torino would have had the opportunity to play the Genoese head-on after defeating them in the first leg 6–1.
The first scudetto.
Heinrich Schönfeld, a forward, joined the team in 1923 and became the top scorer in the 1923–1924 Serie A. He scored 22 goals, in 20 games, scoring 51.1% of the team's goals.
The club experienced its first success under the presidency of Count Enrico Marone Cinzano, who was responsible for building the Stadio Filadelfia. In attack, Torino boasted the "Trio delle meraviglie" (Trio of Wonders), composed of Julio Libonatti, Adolfo Baloncieri and Gino Rossetti, and won their first "scudetto" on 10 July 1927 after a 5–0 win against Bologna. However, the title was revoked on 3 November 1927 due to the "Allemandi Case".
After the revoking of the prior "scudetto", Torino were reconfirmed champions of Italy in the 1927–28 season. The "Trio of Wonders" scored 89 goals between them, with the title won on 22 July 1928, a 2–2 draw against Milan.
After the resignation of Cinzano, the club began a slow decline in the early 1930s and often finished mid-table. It was not until the 1935–36 season that it began its revival, with a third-place finish in the league and first victory of the Coppa Italia. Renamed "Associazione Calcio Torino" due to the Italian fascist regime, Torino finished in second place in the 1938–39 season, under the technical director Ernest Erbstein.
In 1939–40, Torino finished in fifth place, and saw the arrival of club president Ferruccio Novo. Novo provided financial support to the club and utilised his skill as a careful administrator. With valuable contributions from Antonio Janni, Giacinto Ellena and Mario Sperone, Novo was able to build a team known as the "Grande Torino".
Grande Torino.
The club's greatest period is encapsulated in the "Grande Torino", a team which won five titles in a row (not considering the interruption to the league in the 1944 Campionato Alta Italia, in which the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) in 2002 recognised only honorary value to Spezia) between 1942 and 1949, and the Coppa Italia in 1943 (due to this success, Torino was the first team to win the coveted "Scudetto" and Coppa Italia "double" in Italy during the same season). Torino's players formed the backbone of the Italy national team in this period, at one point fielding ten players simultaneously in the "Azzurri".
The captain and undisputed leader of the team was Valentino Mazzola, father of Ferruccio and Sandro, who would subsequently follow their father in becoming footballers. The typical starting lineup was: Bacigalupo; Ballarin; Maroso; Grezar; Rigamonti; Castigliano; Menti; Loik; Gabetto; Mazzola; Ossola. Their success came to an abrupt end on 4 May 1949 when the Fiat G.212 airliner carrying the whole team crashed against the retaining wall of the Basilica of Superga in Turin. The crash was attributed to dense fog and spatial disorientation due a faulty altimeter in the cockpit. The team had been returning from a friendly with Benfica played in Lisbon. In addition to the entire team and reserve players, the crash claimed the lives of coaches Egri Erbstein and Leslie Lievesley, two club officials, the club masseur, three journalists, and the four members of the crew.
From relegation to the title.
Difficult years followed in the aftermath of the tragedy. A slow decline led to the club's first relegation to Serie B, which took place under the name "Talmone Torino" in 1958–59. The stay in Serie B would only last one season, with Torino's return to the top flight in 1960–61. In 1963, Orfeo Pianelli assumed presidency. He appointed Nereo Rocco as manager and signed club icon Gigi Meroni, nicknamed "The Maroon Butterfly" ("La Farfalla Granata"). In 1964–65, the team finished in third place.
On 15 October 1967, Meroni was killed while crossing the street after a league game. Despite the tragedy, Torino finished the season in seventh place and won the Coppa Italia. The reconstruction of a winning team, initiated by the club president Pianelli, continued with the victory of another Coppa Italia in the 1970–71 season.
In the 1971–72 season, Torino managed a third-place finish, placed just one point behind Juventus. Across the following three seasons, Torino placed sixth, fifth, and sixth again ahead of what would be their seventh Serie A title in the 1975–76 season. The scudetto was won after a comeback against Juventus, who held a five-point advantage over the "Granata" during the spring. However, three straight losses for the "Bianconeri", the second of which was in the derby, allowed Torino to overtake. In the final round, Torino held a one-point advantage and, until then, had won every previous home fixture. Torino hosted Cesena at the Comunale but could only manage to draw; Juventus, however, were defeated at Perugia. The title was won by two points ahead of Juventus, 27 years after the Superga tragedy.
The same title race was repeated the next year in a season that saw Torino finish with 50 points behind Juventus's 51, a record points total for the 16-team league format. In 1978, Torino finished second again (tied with a Vicenza side led by Paolo Rossi), still behind Juventus but with a larger gulf in points. In later years, whilst still remaining one of Serie A's top teams, the team began a slow decline and was not able to replicate past results, with the exception of the second place in 1984–85, where the team finished behind a Verona side led by Osvaldo Bagnoli.
Journey in Europe and bankruptcy.
At the end of the 1988–89 season Torino were relegated to Serie B for the second time in their history. The club was promoted back to Serie A in the 1989–90 season, and after having made important signings, qualified for the UEFA Cup under Emiliano Mondonico. The following season, Torino knocked Real Madrid out of the 1991–92 UEFA Cup in the semifinals, but lost the final on the away goals rule to Dutch side Ajax, after a 2–2 draw in Turin and 0–0 in Amsterdam. In Serie A, Torino finished in third place.
In the 1992–93 season, Torino won their fifth Coppa Italia after defeating Roma, however the club subsequently went through a period of severe economic difficulties. The club changed presidents and managers several times, but the results continued to worsen, and at the end of the 1995–96 season, Torino were relegated for a third time.
After a play-off lost on penalties in the 1997–98 season to Perugia, Torino returned to Serie A in 1998–99, but were once again relegated at the end of the 1999–2000 season. The club was immediately promoted back in the 2000–01 season, and the following year finished in 11th place, and qualified for the Intertoto Cup. After being eliminated by Villarreal on penalties, Torino suffered its worst performance in Serie A, and were relegated after finishing in last place. Under Renato Zaccarelli, Torino achieved promotion in the 2004–05 season. However, due to heavy debts accumulated under the president Francesco Cimminelli, Torino were denied entry into Serie A and the club's bankruptcy was announced on 9 August 2005. On 16 August, the FIGC accepted the proposal of a new professional entity known as "Società Civile Campo Torino", formed by a group of businessmen and led by lawyer Pierluigi Marengo. The club was granted admission to the Petrucci Law, which guaranteed registration to Serie B, as well as all of the sporting titles of "Torino Calcio." On 19 August, Urbano Cairo was officially announced as the new president of the club at the bar Norman (once known as Voigt brewery). With the sale, the club changed its name to "Torino Football Club".
Torino achieved immediate promotion in the 2005–06 season after winning the play-offs. The following season, Torino escaped relegation in the penultimate round of matches. After three seasons, the club once again were relegated to Serie B. During the 2009–10 season, Cairo named Gianluca Petrachi as the new sporting director at Torino, but the club failed to gain promotion that season and the one following.
Return to Europe.
On 6 June 2011, the club officially announced Gian Piero Ventura as the new manager ahead of the 2011–12 Serie B season, with Ventura signing a one-year contract. After a long campaign, Torino secured promotion to Serie A on 20 May 2012, after defeating Modena 2–0 in the penultimate round of the season. After achieving safety from relegation in the 2012–13 season, the 2013–14 season marked a sharp upturn for Torino, who finished seventh place, and qualified for the 2014–15 Europa League. The stars of the year were Alessio Cerci and Ciro Immobile; the latter finished as the top scorer in Serie A.
The 2014–15 season saw Torino reach the round of 16 of the Europa League, where they were eliminated by Zenit Saint Petersburg. In the league, Torino finished ninth, and in spring, won their first derby in 20 years. The following year, Torino finished the 2015–16 season in twelfth place, after which Ventura, after five years in charge, left the club for the Italy national football team. He was replaced by Siniša Mihajlović, who finished the 2016–17 season in ninth place. He was replaced by Walter Mazzarri in January, who guided the club to another ninth-place finish at the end of the 2017–18 season. The following season Torino finished in seventh place and qualified for the Europa League after a five-year absence. Torino finished the season on 63 points, a club record since the introduction of the three points system in 1994. Torino, however, would fail to enter the group stages of the 2019–20 Europa League after being eliminated in the play-offs by Wolverhampton Wanderers. In the league, after a strong start to the season, Torino collapsed and only obtained a minimum achievement of safety from relegation.
The following season was also negative, and marked by the alternation on the bench of managers Marco Giampaolo and Davide Nicola. Torino managed only to achieve safety from relegation on the penultimate round of the season with a 0–0 draw away against Lazio. The following season saw the arrival of Ivan Jurić on the bench, who guided the club to a tenth place finish.
Colours and badge.
The first uniform used by Torino only a few days after its foundation and in the first game of its history against Pro Vercelli was striped orange and black, similar to the kits used by Internazionale Torino and Football Club Torinese, the historical predecessors of the newly formed club. Incidentally the colours were too similar to that of the Habsburgs, historical enemies of the then ruling Italian house and considered inappropriate. Given the need to adopt a definitive color the founders opted in the end for granata, a dark shade of red similar to burgundy.
The most widely accepted story is that it was adopted in honour of the Duke of the Abruzzi and the House of Savoy, which, after the victorious liberation of Turin from the French in 1706, adopted a blood-colored handkerchief in honour of a messenger killed bringing the news of victory. Other accounts, considered less reliable, speak of a tribute to the founder Alfred Dick, who was a fan of the Genevan team Servette, the Swiss club of the founders homeland, or a reference to the English club Sheffield, the oldest football club in the world, whose colours were also initially adopted by Internazionale Torino. There is even the possibility that the dark red was created by chance, as a result of repeated washing—a reconstruction that is found with many other club's football kits—among the uniforms that were red with black socks; the colour derived, being considered a good omen, would eventually be chosen as the official colour. Previously, the club had tried to obtain permission to use royal blue, but the monarchs of Italy were reluctant to grant the use of their dynastic color to a single team, as opposed to a few years later, when Azure adopted by the various national sports teams.
Since then, the traditional home uniform of Torino has been composed of a kit combined with traditionally white but occasionally also maroon shorts, and black socks cuffed maroon. It has not been unusual however to see the team take to the field with maroon socks, especially at the turn of the 1970s and 1980s when the team permanently adopted a complete maroon kit. The away uniform, usually in reverse colours, consists of a white shirt with contrasting cuffs, maroon or sometimes white shorts, white socks and a maroon lapel. Cyclically, an away shirt with a diagonal maroon band has also been used. This is an homage to River Plate, the Argentine club which has had close historical ties to Torino since the tragedy of Superga. the shirt was debuted on 6 January 1953 in a league match against Milan, ending 1–1.
The Torino club badge has always featured a rampant bull, the symbol of the city of Turin. The current badge was adopted in the 2005–06 season, the first following the bankruptcy of "Torino Calcio". The "1906" on the left side of the shield was later added to denote the founding year of the historic "Foot-Ball Club Torino".
In the 1980s, the Torino badge was square in shape with a stylised bull and the words "Torino Calcio." This badge is still held in high regard by the fans, and in 2013 it was voted by the readers of "Guerin Sportivo" as the most beautiful club logo of all time. From 1990 until the bankruptcy, the badge in use recalled the one used at the time of the "Grande Torino", with the important difference that the right side of the oval crossed the letter "T" and "C" (initials of "Torino Calcio") instead of the letters "A", "C" and "T" (initials of "Associazione Calcio Torino").
In 2017, the Irish club Wexford Youths renamed itself Wexford F.C. and adopted a new crest with rampant bull, inspired by Torino's. Club chairman Mick Wallace is known to be a Torino fan.
Stadium.
The first official match after the club's foundation, a derby match against Juventus, took place on 13 January 1907 at the Stadio Velodrome Umberto. The club later moved to the "Piazza d'armi", which comprised numerous pitches: from 23 January 1911, the "Lato Ferrovia"; and from 26 February 1911, the "Lato Crocetta". Towards the end of 1913 the club moved to the "Stradale Stupinigi"; with the outbreak of the First World War, the stadium was requisitioned for military purposes.
From 11 October 1925 until the end of the 1925–26 season, Torino played their home games at "Motovelodromo Corso Casale" (now restored, it is dedicated to Fausto Coppi and also hosts American football matches), while awaiting their move to the Stadio Filadelfia. The "Fila" as it was known was heavily associated with the exploits of the "Grande Torino" team of the 1940s: opened on 17 October 1926 with a match against Fortitudo Roma, it hosted Torino's games continuously until 11 May 1958 (the final match being a 4–2 victory over Genoa). In the 1958–59 season, the club briefly moved to the Stadio Comunale: the move was short-lived however, as the club was relegated to Serie B that year, and returned to the Filadelfia out of superstition.
Torino played the entirety of the 1959–60 season and the next at the Filadelfia, but in 1961–62 and 1962–63 the club began to use the Comunale for "special" matches. The move to the Comunale, a stadium with a standing capacity of 65,000, was completed in 1963–64, and Torino remained there until 27 May 1990 when the stadium was abandoned in favour of the Stadio delle Alpi.
Built specifically for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, the Stadio delle Alpi was home to Torino from 1990 to 2006. Following the reconstruction carried out to make the stadium suitable to host the 2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony and closing ceremony, Torino returned to the Stadio Comunale, renamed the Stadio Olimpico. The new capacity was now 27,958 seated, reduced by about 38,000 from the original in compliance with modern safety standards. In April 2016, the Olimpico was renamed in honour of the "Grande Torino".
The Stadio Filadelfia also served as the training ground of Torino from 1926 to 1993. More recently, from 2006 to 2017, the team's training base was the Sisport di Corso Unione Sovietica. In the 2017–18 season, Torino returned to training at the reconstructed Filadelfia.

Notable players.
Torino and the Italy national team.
Among the players of Torino to win international honours with the Italy national football team are Adolfo Baloncieri, Antonio Janni, Julio Libonatti and Gino Rossetti, all winners with Italy at the Central European International Cup 1927–30, and who (with exception of Libonatti) also won bronze medals at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Subsequently, Lido Vieri and Giorgio Ferrini were victorious at the 1968 European Championship with the "Azzurri", whilst Giuseppe Dossena won the FIFA World Cup in 1982.
On 11 May 1947, during a friendly match between Italy and Hungary that finished 3–2, Vittorio Pozzo fielded 10 players who were at Torino; this remains the largest number of Italian players fielded from the same club in the same match in the history of the Italy national team.
With 74 players having represented Italy throughout the club's existence, Torino is the fifth ranked Italian club for number of players capped by the "Azzurri" (sixth by number of total admissions). Francesco Graziani is the Torino player who has accumulated the most appearances (47) and goals (20) for Italy. On 11 June 2017, Andrea Belotti scored the hundredth goal of a Torino player in an "Azzurri" shirt, during a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Liechtenstein.
Youth system.
The Torino youth system is formed of four men's teams that participate in separate national leagues (Primavera, Beretti, Allievi Nazionali Serie A &amp; B, and Allievi Nazionali Lega Pro) and three that participate at regional level (Giovanissimi Nazionali, Giovanissimi Regionali A &amp; B). Torino was one of the first Italian clubs to adopt a youth system, organised as early as the 1930s and is considered one of the best in Italy.
Domestically, Torino hold the record for most championships won in both the Campionato Nazionale Primavera with nine titles, and the Campionato Nazionale Dante Berretti with 10 titles. In addition, they have won the Coppa Italia Primavera a record eight times, and the prestigious Torneo di Viareggio six times.
The players developed in the Torino youth system were nicknamed "Balon-Boys" in honour of Adolfo Baloncieri, the player and club icon who ended his Torino career in 1932. The Torino youth system has developed numerous renowned players, including actor and journalist Raf Vallone, who devoted himself to a career in the arts after his debut for the first team.
 "As of 28 May 2021."
Supporters and rivalries.
The fans of Torino hold a number of distinctions, including the first ever organised supporters group in Italy, the Fedelissimi Granata, founded in 1951. The fans also displayed the first banner of an organised club, at the Stadio Filadelfia, and organised the first away trip by plane in Italian football, in 1963, during a game against Roma. It was at the Filadelfia that Oreste Bolmida, the trumpeter fan made famous by the film "" also performed. In the 1970s the fans began to organise the club's first choreographies, which were used in commercials of French carmaker Renault in the subsequent decade. In 1979, the "curva Maratona" was awarded "the most beautiful stand of Europe" by French magazine Onze Mondial; an image of this section of the stadium was later featured on the cover of France Football on 21 December 1979.
The fans of Torino are "twinned" with the fans of Fiorentina. The link between the two sides was born in the early 1970s due to a common anti-Juventus sentiment and the closeness of the "Viola" after the Superga tragedy. Supporters of Torino are on good terms with the "curva nord" of Alessandria and "curva sud" of Nocerina.
The friendship between Brazilian club Corinthians and Torino dates back to 1914; that year, Torino became the first Italian club to travel South America on tour. The club played six friendly matches, two of which were against Corinthians, and despite the results on the field, the two clubs established friendly relationships. On 4 May 1949, when the "Grande Torino" team perished in plane crash of Superga, Corinthians paid tribute to the Italians in a friendly match against Portuguesa when its starting XI took to the field in Torino's kit.
The Argentines of River Plate are historically twinned with Torino, since the time of the Superga disaster. In the period following the disaster, the Argentine club was very close to the Italian club, organising a friendly and fundraiser to help the devastated team. On 26 May 1949, River flew to Turin to play a friendly charity match organised by the FIGC, together with a selection that included the strongest Italian players of the era, gathered under the name of "Torino symbol." As a testimony to the relationship between the two clubs, the away jersey of the Argentine club has been maroon on several occasions (most recently, the 2005–06 season) while Torino have sported several variations of an away kit with a diagonal band, an homage to River's home kit. The bond with the Portuguese of Benfica is also very strong, the last to have met the Grande Torino before the aerial disaster of Superga. Other supporters with whom there is a friendship are supporters of English club Manchester City.
Torino's historical rivalries are with Sampdoria, Piacenza, Verona, Lazio, Perugia, Internazionale, Atalanta, Ternana and Ancona. Torino's friendship with Genoa turned negative as a result of Genoese festivities during the Torino–Genoa match on 24 May 2009 won by the "Rossoblu"; the result contributed to Torino's relegation to Serie B. On 16 December 2012, the day when the two clubs met for the first time after Torino's return to Serie A, clashes erupted between the two club's organised supporters. The rivalry with city rivals Juventus is the most heated, with the two teams taking part in the "Derby della Mole", one of the most popular derbies in Italian football and the oldest still played.

Statistics and records.
Torino is in 8th place in the Serie A all-time standings, which takes account of all the football teams that have played in the top flight at least once.
In the Italian league, the team has finished in first place on eight occasions, although the club has only won seven championship titles, seven times in second place and nine times in third place. In 100 seasons, including 18 in various championships that preluded the single round format (Torino withdrew in 1908 and the 1915–16 Coppa Federale is not recognised), 73 in Serie A and 12 in Serie B, the club has finished on the podium in 23% of cases.
In the 2006–07 season, Torino, for the first time in history played at a level higher than Juventus: while the "Granata" competed in Serie A, Juventus took part in Serie B following the aftermath of the "Calciopoli" scandal.
Giorgio Ferrini holds the club's official appearance record with 566 appearances (plus 56 goals) accumulated between 1959 and 1975. The record for the most goals scored is held by Paolo Pulici, with 172 official goals (in 437 appearances) between 1967 and 1982.
Eight different Torino players have won the "Capocannoniere" award for league top scorer in the Italian top flight: the first was the Austrian Heinrich Schönfeld with 22 goals in 1923–24. He was followed by the Italian Argentine Julio Libonatti, who scored 35 goals in 1927–28 and Gino Rossetti (36) in 1928–29. Rossetti's tally of 36 goals remains the highest number of goals ever scored to win the award. Eusebio Castigliano was the leading scorer (13) of the first season after the Second World War (1945–46), followed by Valentino Mazzola in 1946–47 (29). Torino would have to wait almost 30 years before another league top scorer emerged, namely when Paolo Pulici broke his low-scoring streak in the mid-1970s and won the award in 1972–73 (17), 1974–75 (18) and 1975–76 (21). He was succeeded by teammate Francesco Graziani in 1976–77 who scored 21 goals. After almost 40 years without a top-scorer from Torino, Ciro Immobile (22) established himself as the league's top scorer in 2013–14.

Mantova 1911

Association football club
Football club
Mantova 1911 Società a Responsabilità Limitata (Mantova 1911 s.r.l.), commonly referred to as Mantova, is an Italian professional football club based in Mantua (Italian: "Mantova"), Lombardy. Mantova had played consecutively in the Italian Serie B from the 2005–06 season to 2009–10 as Associazione Calcio Mantova (A.C. Mantova), when they were relegated after ending the season in 20th place.
During the summer 2010, the club went bankrupt and was refounded as Mantova F.C., being immediately promoted in the following season from Serie D group B to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.
The club went bankrupt again in 2017 and has since played three consecutive seasons in Serie D.
Colours and badge.
Colours.
Mantova played in a sky blue shirt with white shorts and sky blue socks until 1956, when OZO company became the club's main sponsor. Colours were changed from sky blue and white to white and red, the colours of the company, in an unusual scheme for Italian football: white with a red sash. Mantova debuted in Serie A with this kit.
In the late 1960s, when the club had poor results, a red shirt with white shorts and red socks was adopted as the home kit. The OZO Mantova kit was reintroduced by the owner Fabrizio Lori in the 2000s, and since then became the home kit.
In the last years the away kit has usually retained the home kit scheme, inverting the colours: a white sash on a red base.
Sky blue has been used mainly for third kits. During the 2010-11 campaign, a special sky blue shirt with a white and red sash was released to celebrate the club's 100th anniversary and was used as the first choice kit for the final part of the season.
During the Serie B years between 2005 and 2008 Mantova used a yellow kit with a green sash to remember the "Piccolo Brasile", the team who achieved three promotions in four years between the end of the 1950s and the start of the 1960s.
Badge.
Mantova crest has always been characterized by two elements: the town's coat of arms and a light blue semicircle to remember the original colours of the team, combined in a round shape. The round element has been inserted in a red and white shield, with an upper white stripe in which the name of the club is written.
History.
Mantova was founded in 1911. They played in Serie A for seven seasons: 1961–62, 1962–63, 1963–64, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1967–68, and 1971–72, being nicknamed in its initial period as "Little Brazil" ("Piccolo Brasile"). The green and yellow shirt actually remembered that period, by far the best one in the team history. Mantova has also played eight seasons in Serie B, winning the title 1970–71.
Mantova was cancelled two times from the Italian football panorama, in 1983 and 1994, both times due to insolvency.
Former famous players for the club include Dino Zoff, Angelo Sormani, Anton Alleman and Karl-Heinz Schnellinger.
Mantova was promoted from Serie C2 to Serie B in two consecutive seasons, in 2003–04 as league champions, and in 2004–05 as runners-up and playoff winners. Mantova begun the 2005–06 Serie B campaign introducing itself as a strong potential candidate for promotion to Serie A, despite its lack of players experienced with these levels (almost the same squad which promoted to Serie B the previous season) and a coach, Domenico Di Carlo, on just his second year as first team football trainer. The team led the Serie B table for a long part of the season, gaining an unexpected interest by the media. However, Mantova was not able to maintain the head of the league in the end, and the team concluded its season in fourth place, gaining a spot in the promotion playoffs. Successively, AC Mantova won its playoff semifinal against Modena after two ties (0–0, 1–1), qualifying because of its top placement in the regular season. The first playoff final, against Torino, saw Mantova winning at home 4–2. However, Mantova was not able to maintain this advantage in the return match, lost 3–1 in Turin after extra time, which allowed Torino to be promoted in Serie A because of a superior placement in the regular season.
During the 2006–07 season, Mantova became the first club to beat Juventus in a Serie B match. They ended the season in eighth place, confirming themselves in the top side of the league table. Following Di Carlo's resignations, Mantova appointed Attilio Tesser as new head coach for their 2007–08 Serie B campaign. As part of an ambitious summer transfer market, on 23 August 2007 Mantova signed former Italian international Stefano Fiore. However, the club's campaign proved to be disappointing as the team failed to break into the promotion playoff zone, resulting in the sacking of Tesser in the mid-season. He was replaced by Giuseppe Brucato, a young manager with no previous experience in the league, who guided the club to a mid-table finish in the season.
Brucato was confirmed as head coach of Mantova for the 2008–09 season. As Fiore parted company with the club following an unimpressive season with the "virgiliani", he was replaced by Tomas Locatelli. However, Mantova failed to assure themselves a place in the higher ranks of the league, causing the sacking of Brucato following a 1–3 home defeat to Parma. The club successively appointed former Milan defender Alessandro Costacurta as its new head coach. Costacurta later resigned and was replaced by Mario Somma, who led the club to a final 13th place, only two points ahead the relegation play-off zone.
For the 2009–10 season, Mantova was guided by former Italian international Michele Serena. The financial situation of the club was deteriorated, which the club raised the short term profit by player exchange, but also raised the long term amortisation cost. The club had swapped Stefano Mondini with Christian Jidayi on 30 June 2008 in co-ownership deal for €750,000, made the clubs had player selling revenue of €1.5 million. June 2009 also saw Jidayi return to Cesena and Mondini back to Mantova; 50% of both players' rights were valued at €750,000. However, it became a financial burden for both clubs, which Mantova had to amortise Mondini's value (€1.5 million) in instalments as amortisation. In June 2008 Mantova also swapped Valerio Di Cesare (€1M) and Simone Calori (€0.5M) with Riccardo Fissore (€0.5M) and Mattia Marchesetti (€1M). Again, Mantova had to amortise €0.5M in for 3 seasons for Fissore (€166,667) and Marchesetti (€333,333).
At the beginning of 2010–11 season, Mantova went bankrupt and a new entity was admitted to Serie D. Mantova came first in Girone B and gained promotion to 2011–12 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. They finished 16th and only escaped relegation after beating both Lecco and Vibonese in the playoffs. The first leg against Vibonese was a 0–0 stalemate away, leading to fears the club would not survive the second leg. However, Mantova went on to record a famous 4–0 victory. The home leg was viewed by over 3,000 spectators and Mantova enjoyed some of the strongest support of the 40 sides in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. Throughout the 2011–12 season, Mantova sacked three managers and three sporting directors.
In the 2012–13 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, Mantova had a solid season, finishing in ninth place, nine points short of a promotion playoff place and 11 points above a relegation playoff place. In the off season, 70% of Mantova is sold to former Sambonifacese president Michele Lodi, who became the president of Mantova.
The Lega Pro Seconda Divisione underwent a reformatting. The first eight teams in each girone, plus one team winning the relegation playoff round from each division will remain in Lega Pro. The last six teams in each girone, plus three relegation play-out losers from each division will be relegated to Serie D. In all, eighteen teams will remain in Lega Pro, and eighteen teams will be relegated to Serie D.
In the 2013–14 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, Mantova finished eighth, which guaranteed them a spot in next season's 2014–15 Lega Pro Divisione Unica, the new Serie C. The team was part of the "Group A".
Mantova remained in the third tier until 2017.
At the start of season, the club did not join the 2017–18 Serie C, a successor club, Mantova 1911 S.S.D., was admitted to 2017–18 Serie D instead. In 2018 it was taken over by Maurizio Setti, the holder of Hellas Verona, who invested in the club to be promoted to Serie C. Mantova lost the championship to Como despite reaching 83 points, and it is now at its third consecutive season in Serie D.

US Avellino 1912

Italian football club
Football club
Unione Sportiva Avellino 1912, commonly known as US Avellino, is an Italian professional football club based in Avellino, Campania. It competes in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football.
It is the official continuity club of US Avellino 1912, known worldwide for having competed in Serie A for ten consecutive seasons, from 1978–1979 to 1987–1988. The team went through two major reboots: once, in 2009, when it went bankrupt, and then, in 2018, when it was excluded from Serie B. In both cases, new clubs were founded to join the Serie D league.
The club was renamed as "Avellino Calcio.12 Società Sportiva Dilettantistica" in 2009, then "Associazione Sportiva Avellino 1912" in 2010, and restored to the original "Unione Sportiva Avellino 1912" in 2015, although initially taking the name "Calcio Avellino Società Sportiva Dilettantistica" for the 2018–2019 season.
History.
Foundation.
The club was founded as "U.S. Avellino" on 12 December 1912 to give the town of Avellino a footballing representative. The early history of the club is quite obscure as they only competed at a lower level against regional sides. Avellino competed in "IV Divisione" from 1913 until after the Second World War; today's equivalent of that level is Serie D.
Post-war emergence.
For the earlier part of their history the club did not achieve anything of note, until being placed in Serie C for the 1945–46 post-War season. In the 1946–47 season they narrowly missed out on getting through to the interregional final, after finishing third in their group.
Avellino beat out the likes of Catania, Reggina and Messina to win promotion to Serie B at the end of the 1940s. However, the club were accused of match fixing and the federation decided to strip them of their promotion, instead relegating them down to Serie D. Although they were able to return to Serie C after one season, Avellino were relegated back down to spend six seasons in a row at Serie D level.
Eventually Avellino returned, but, in the space of six seasons, Avellino gained promotion to Serie C in three of them and were relegated back down twice.
1970s: rise and ten consecutive seasons in Serie A.
Avellino were promoted to Serie B in 1973 and Serie A in 1978. A truly remarkable feat for a southern provincial side was a 10-year stay in Serie A between 1978 and 1988, with the club holding a mid-table place for the majority of that period. Their best finish was 8th in 1987, with a team starring Angelo Alessio, Paolo Benedetti, Franco Colomba and Dirceu.
1990s and 2000s: decline, ups and downs, and bankruptcy.
The club tended to shift between Serie B and Serie C1 in the decade following relegation from Serie A in 1988.
The club marked a surprising Serie B return after defeating neighbors and football powerhouse Napoli in the 2004-05 Serie C1/B play-off finals. An unsuccessful 2005–06 campaign ended in a loss on relegation playoffs to Albinoleffe (0–2, 3–2). The 2006–07 season, with Giuseppe Galderisi as head coach, then replaced by Giovanni Vavassori, ended in a second place in the Serie C1/B regular season; this was then followed by a successful campaign in the promotion play-offs, in which Avellino defeated Foggia in the finals, being therefore promoted to Serie B once again. However, this was followed by Vavassori's resignations on 16 July 2007, shortly after his confirmation as Avellino boss, being then replaced by Maurizio Sarri two days later. Sarri himself resigned one month later, being replaced by Guido Carboni and later Alessandro Calori. Despite this, the club did not manage to escape relegation, ending the season in 19th place. The club was however readmitted to Serie B later on to fill a league vacancy created by Messina's disbandment.
The team finished second from bottom in the 2008–09 season and was therefore relegated again. On 9 July 2009, the Covisoc ("Commissione di Vigilanza sulle Società Calcistiche", Vigilancy Commission on Football Clubs) organization announced that the team did not pass the financial requirements in order to be admitted to the league. The club was allowed to appeal the decision until 11 July 2009. On 11 July, Avellino failed to appeal the exclusion.
Avellino Calcio.12 S.S.D. restarts from Serie D.
A new club founded in the summer 2009 as "Avellino Calcio.12 S.S.D." restarts from Serie D, finishing 5th, but 4 August 2010 they were later admitted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione to fill vacancies. This ordeal saw them become the latest in a long line of Italian clubs that have faced severe financial difficulties, such as Napoli and Fiorentina.
From Lega Pro Seconda Divisione to Serie B.
In the 2010–11 season the team became Associazione Sportiva Avellino 1912 and played in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione finishing 4th, being defeated by Trapani in the play-off final, but 4 August 2011 it was later admitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione, again, to fill vacancies. In the season 2012–13 Avellino won Lega Pro Prima Divisione and the team obtained the promotion in Serie B, under manager Massimo Rastelli. In 2014–2015, Rastelli led the team to the play-off semi-finals, when they are eliminated by the more prestigious Bologna team despite a 3–2 win away.
2018 Serie B exclusion.
In 2018, Avellino was excluded from Serie B due to submitting a league membership paperwork that was deemed as incomplete, due to a late bank guarantee. Due to this, a new club was re-founded within days in order to submit application to play at Serie D instead. In 2019 Avellino won Serie D and the Scudetto Serie D, reaching the promotion in Serie C for the next season. In 2020–2021, they once again reached the play-off semi-finals, losing to Padova.
Colours and badge.
Its traditional colours are green and white.
Avellino are nicknamed the "Lupi", which means wolf, and their club crest displays a wolf head.

Atalanta BC

Football club in Bergamo, Italy
Football club
Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio, commonly referred to as Atalanta, is a professional football club based in Bergamo, Lombardy, Italy. The club plays in Serie A, having gained promotion from Serie B in 2010–11.
Atalanta was founded in 1907 by Liceo Classico Paolo Sarpi students and is nicknamed "La Dea", the "Nerazzurri" and the "Orobici". The club plays in blue-and-black vertically striped shirts, black shorts and black socks. The club plays its home matches at the 21,747-seater Gewiss Stadium. In Italy, Atalanta is sometimes called "Regina delle provinciali" (queen of the provincial clubs) to mark the fact that the club is the most consistent among Italian clubs not based in a regional capital, having played 62 seasons in Serie A, 28 in Serie B, and only one in Serie C. Atalanta has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Brescia.
The club is also famed for its youth academy, which has produced several notable talents who have played in the top leagues of Europe. 
The club won the Coppa Italia in 1963 and reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup in 1988, when it was competing in Serie B. This is still the joint-best performance ever by a non-first division club in a major UEFA competition (together with Cardiff City). Atalanta also participated in five seasons of the UEFA Europa League (previously known as the UEFA Cup), reaching the quarter-finals in 1991 and in 2022. Atalanta additionally qualified for the UEFA Champions League three times, reaching the quarter-finals in 2020.
History.
Founding and establishment in Serie A (1907–1959).
Atalanta was founded on 17 October 1907 by students of the Liceo Classico Paolo Sarpi and was named after the female athlete of the same name from Greek mythology. Though it immediately established a football sector, it was not the first football association based in Bergamo: "Football Club Bergamo" was founded by Swiss emigrants in 1904, and was absorbed into another club, "Bergamasca", in 1911. The Italian Football Federation did not recognize Atalanta until 1914, and in 1919 announced that it would only allow one club from Bergamo to compete in the highest national league (then called the Prima Categoria). As Atalanta and Bergamasca were rivals and did not come to an agreement, admission to the Prima Categoria was decided by a playoff match; Atalanta won this match 2–0. A merger between the two clubs nevertheless occurred in 1920, forming the new club "Atalanta Bergamasca di Ginnastica e Scherma 1907" (shortened to "Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio") and establishing its black and blue ("nerazzurri") colors.
Atalanta competed in the Seconda Divisione, the second tier, during the early 1920s. In the 1927–28 season, the club won its group and subsequently defeated Pistoiese in the playoffs to win promotion and its first second division league triumph. The club inaugurated its current home stadium in the Borgo Santa Caterina neighborhood in 1928, and was admitted to Serie B, the second tier of the restructured Italian league, in 1929. After almost a decade in Serie B, Atalanta achieved its first promotion to Serie A in 1937 under coach Ottavio Barbieri, though was relegated at the end of the season. The club returned to Serie A in 1940 as champion of Serie B.
During the 1940s, Atalanta performed consistently in the top flight, though the national league was halted between 1943 and 1945 due to World War II. Atalanta achieved a fifth-place finish in the 1947–48 Serie A under coach Ivo Fiorentini, its highest league finish until 2017. The club earned a reputation as the "provinciale terribile" (terrible provincial team) during this time as a result of its successes against well-known metropolitan teams such as the "Grande Torino", who won Serie A five times during the 1940s. Atalanta achieved mid-table finishes during much of the 1950s and remained in Serie A until 1958, when it was relegated due to accusations of match fixing. These accusations were found to be false a year later, after the club returned to Serie A by winning its second Serie B title.
Coppa Italia victory, decline, and reemergence in Europe (1959–1994).
Atalanta won the Coppa Italia in 1963, defeating Torino 3–1 in the final thanks to a hat-trick by striker Angelo Domenghini. This was the senior team's first (and so far only) major trophy. During the early 1960s, the club made its debut in European competitions, among them the 1961–62 Mitropa Cup, the Coppa dell'Amicizia, and the Coppa delle Alpi. As domestic cup winners, the club qualified for the 1963–64 European Cup Winners' Cup, its first major UEFA competition, though was eliminated by Portuguese club Sporting CP in the first round. The club made a few more appearances in international (though not UEFA) cups during the 1960s, though was relegated in 1969 after a decade in the top flight.
During the 1970s, Atalanta experienced several movements between Serie A and Serie B, and was in the second tier for four consecutive seasons between 1973 and 1977. Despite playing in Serie B at the time, the club developed several young players who moved on to historically bigger clubs and won the 1982 FIFA World Cup with Italy. Several difficult seasons then saw Atalanta fall into Serie B in 1980 and Serie C1 in 1981, when for the first time in its history, the club would play outside the top two tiers. This was a blow that revitalized the club, from which many changes in management followed. 
Under new management, Atalanta comfortably won Group A of Serie C1 in 1982, returning to Serie B the next season and then to Serie A in 1984, where it would remain until 1987. Atalanta reached its second Coppa Italia final in 1987, though lost 4–0 to Napoli over two legs. As Napoli also won Serie A that season and therefore qualified for the European Cup, Atalanta qualified for its second European Cup Winners' Cup. This was a turning point for the club; Emiliano Mondonico was appointed as coach and the club would achieve promotion after only one season in Serie B. In the Cup Winners' Cup, Atalanta lost its first match against Welsh club Merthyr Tydfil, but won the return fixture and went on to reach the semi-finals, where it would be eliminated 4–2 on aggregate by Belgian club K.V. Mechelen, who would eventually win the tournament. In doing so, Atalanta achieved the best finish in a UEFA competition of a club playing outside its country's top flight league. With a sixth-place finish in the 1988–89 Serie A, Atalanta qualified for its first UEFA Cup, though was eliminated by Russian club Spartak Moscow in the first round. Atalanta then finished seventh in the 1989–90 Serie A and reached the quarterfinals of the 1990–91 UEFA Cup, losing to local rival and eventual winner Internazionale.
Fluctuating performances (1994–2016).
After several upper mid-table finishes and a narrowly missed UEFA cup qualification in 1993, the club was relegated in 1994 after several investments to raise the club's goals failed, though would return to Serie A in 1995. In the 1995–96 season, Atalanta reached the Coppa Italia final again, losing against Fiorentina. In 1996–97 season, striker Filippo Inzaghi scored 24 league goals and became the first (and so far only) Atalanta player to be named "capocannoniere" (Serie A top scorer). The club then sold several key players, causing it to struggle and return to Serie B in 1998; it would remain there until 2000, when coach Giovanni Vavassori revitalized the team with youth academy players in a successful promotion campaign.
In the 2000s, Atalanta experienced more divisional movements: it was relegated in 2002–03 (despite finishing seventh two years prior) and 2004–05, but achieved promotion to Serie A after only one season in Serie B both times, winning the 2005–06 edition. After a tumultuous 2009–10 season, which saw the club change coach three times, the club was once again relegated; after this relegation, entrepreneur Antonio Percassi became the club's new president. and Stefano Colantuono returned as coach. The club won Serie B in 2011 and thus immediately returned to Serie A. Despite this success, club captain Cristiano Doni was named among the suspects in a match-fixing scandal (also known as "Calcioscommesse"); Doni was handed a three-and-a-half-year ban from football and the club was docked six points in the 2011–12 league table and two points in the 2012–13 league table. Throughout the early and mid-2010s, Atalanta generally lingered in lower-midtable in Serie A.
New heights under Gasperini (2016–present).
Former Genoa coach Gian Piero Gasperini was appointed before the 2016–17 season. Despite initial difficulties, the club's results steadily improved throughout the season. Gasperini integrated players from the club's youth sector and led the club to a fourth-place league finish with 72 points, besting its previous records and qualifying for the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League after a 26-year absence from UEFA competitions. In the Europa League, the club reached the round of 32, losing 4–3 on aggregate to Borussia Dortmund. In 2017–18, Atalanta finished seventh in the league, entering the qualifying rounds for 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, though was eliminated in a penalty shootout by Danish club Copenhagen. Despite a difficult start to the 2018–19 season, Atalanta achieved many positive results and finished third in Serie A, its best ever league finish; with this result, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time in its history. Atalanta also reached the Coppa Italia final, though lost 2–0 to Lazio.
In the 2019–20 season, Atalanta lost its first three Champions League matches, but went on to qualify for the round of 16. Atalanta then defeated Spanish club Valencia in both legs of the round of 16, reaching the quarterfinals, where it would be eliminated by French champion Paris Saint-Germain. The club also repeated its third-place finish in Serie A and achieved a second consecutive Champions League qualification, breaking several club records. In the 2020–21 season, Atalanta reached the round of 16 in the Champions League for the second time, following an away victory over Ajax, and later secured Champions League qualification and third place in Serie A for the third consecutive time.
On 19 February 2022, a U.S. based consortium led by Stephen Pagliuca acquired a 55% stake of La Dea srl, the controlling company of Atalanta, previously wholly owned by the Percassi family. Under the new agreement, Pagliuca was named co-chairman, with Antonio Percassi staying on as chairman. Atalanta finished eighth in Serie A in 2022, failing to qualify for European competitions, though rebounded the next season with a fifth-place finish in Serie A and qualification to the Europa League. On 4 August 2023, Atalanta established a reserve team in Serie C, becoming the second Italian club to do so.
Colours, kits, and crest.
Colours and kits.
The first kits adopted by Atalanta after its founding featured thin black and white vertical stripes. These were Atalanta's colours until 1920, when the club merged with local rival Bergamasca (which had blue and white kits) in order to compete in the Italian league. Following the merger, the common colour white was eliminated, leaving black and blue ("nerazzurri") as the colours of the newly-formed Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio. In the first years following this merger, the club's kits featured black and blue quarters. Atalanta adopted its classic black and blue vertical stripes several years later.
Atalanta's home kits have characteristically had black and blue vertical stripes since their adoption in the 1920s. Slight variations in thickness of the stripes have existed over the years, though the club never strayed far from the classic design for its home kits. Atalanta's away kits have traditionally been mostly white, with various touches of black and blue and other details. The club's third kits and goalkeeper kits have not historically adhered to any strict pattern; many colours (among them green, red, light blue, and black) have been used for these over the years.
Since 2010, Atalanta plays its final home match of the calendar year, a "Christmas Match", in specially designed kits. The kits are then auctioned to raise money for charity.
Crest.
Atalanta has had five crests since its foundation, all of which depict some combination of the team's name (except between 1984 and 1993), colours, and (since 1963) the Greek mythological athlete Atalanta, from whom the club derives its name as well as its nickname "La Dea".
The club's first three crests were shields featuring the name Atalanta on top, coloured stripes on the left, and another symbolic representation on the right. The original crest dates back to 1907 and had the club's original black and white stripes alongside a blue patch. In 1963, after the club won the Coppa Italia, the crest was redesigned to feature black and blue stripes alongside a running girl representing Atalanta. The crest's colours and representation of Atalanta changed again in the 1970s, though followed the same basic shape as the 1963 version.
In 1984, the crest underwent a major redesign: the club's name and the running girl's body were removed from the crest and its shape was changed from a shield to a circle. This "classic" crest featured a white silhouette of Atalanta's head on a black and blue background, enclosed in three concentric white, black, and golden yellow circles. Black, blue, and white were retained—as the club's colours—while yellow was added to represent the golden apples, which according to mythology, Hippomenes tossed to Atalanta to distract her and defeat her in a footrace.
The club's modern crest was designed in 1993. It incorporates the 1984 crest into its design, though tilts Atalanta's head and lacks the yellow circle. The name Atalanta and founding year 1907 were added respectively above and below the circle, which is enclosed in an ellipse featuring the same split black and blue background as the 1984 design.
Stadium.
Atalanta has played at its current stadium, the 24,950-seater Gewiss Stadium in the Borgo Santa Caterina neighborhood of Bergamo, since 1928. Prior to its opening, Atalanta played at several other grounds in Bergamo. Between its founding in 1907 and recognition by the FIGC in 1914, the club did not have a dedicated playing field and only played friendly matches in public spaces—the Piazza d'Armi and the Campo di Marte in Bergamo. In 1914, Atalanta's first playing field was established on the Via Maglio del Lotto, near the Bergamo–Milan railway. It measured and had a seated capacity of 1,000 spectators. Due to financial hardship during World War I, though, Atalanta was forced to sell the land containing its field, leaving it without a home ground. As a solution, entrepreneur and philanthropist Betty Ambiveri sold the Clementina field, an older venue in Seriate that hosted sporting events such as cycling, to the club. The new field was inaugurated as the "Atalanta Stadium" and it hosted 14,000 spectators in its first match against "La Dominante" of Genoa.
With the growth of football in the 1920s, Atalanta needed a new stadium. The new stadium was constructed on Viale Margherita (now Viale Giulio Cesare), replacing a hippodrome that once occupied the site. Construction of the new stadium took one year; it opened in 1928 and cost 3.5 million lire. The stadium was named after fascist Mario Brumana; this was common naming practice in fascist Italy. The Brumana stadium was much larger than the Clementina field, having a seated capacity of 12,000 spectators in two "tribune" (side stands) and a larger field measuring ; it also featured a running track, as it was planned to form part of a larger complex. On 1 November 1928, Atalanta played its first unofficial match at the stadium (a 4–2 victory against Triestina); the stadium was then officially inaugurated on 23 December 1928, when Atalanta defeated "La Dominante Genova" 2–0 in front of over 14,000 spectators.
After World War II, the stadium was renamed the "Stadio Comunale" ("Municipal Stadium"), as fascism no longer existed in Italy. Expansion of the stadium began in the years following the war: the construction of a south stand (the "Curva Sud") began in 1949, and a second stand at the north end (the "Curva Nord") followed during the 1960s, opening in 1971. Later, in 1984, the running track was removed in order to expand the stadium's capacity upon Atalanta's return to Serie A after five years. The club's first match in the 1984–85 Serie A, a 1–1 draw against Inter, had an attendance of over 43,000 spectators, a record attendance for the Stadio Comunale.
The "Tribuna Giulio Cesare" underwent modernization during the early 1990s, and the stadium was renamed the "Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia" ("Blue Athletes of Italy") in 1994. In 1997, following the death of 22-year-old forward Federico Pisani in a car accident, the "Curva Nord" was nicknamed the "Curva Pisani" in his honor. Similarly, the "Curva Sud" was nicknamed the "Curva Morosini" in 2012 to posthumously honor 25-year-old youth academy player Piermario Morosini, who died following collapse on the field during a Serie B match between Pescara and Livorno. In 2015, the stadium also expanded its side stands to offer pitchside views only several meters (feet) from the benches, a revolutionary feature of Italian stadiums at the time.
On 10 May 2017, Atalanta announced the acquisition of the stadium from the "comune" for 8.6 million euros, becoming one of only four Serie A clubs to own its home stadium. This acquisition allowed the club to authorize a renovation project for the stadium, for like many Italian stadiums, much of its structure and facilities were considered outdated. This renovation project was also necessary to upgrade the stadium to meet UEFA standards for hosting matches in UEFA competitions. Because the stadium was not ready at the time, Atalanta had to play its Europa League home matches at the Mapei Stadium in Reggio Emilia and its Champions League home matches in its debut season at San Siro in Milan.
Following a sponsorship agreement with electronics company Gewiss lasting at least until 2025, the stadium was renamed the Gewiss Stadium on 1 July 2019. On 6 October 2019, the renovated "Curva Nord" was inaugurated for Atalanta's home match against Lecce; it has covered seating for over 9,000 spectators. A year later, both side stands underwent modernization and the "Curva Sud" had temporary seats installed on the concrete. These upgrades allowed Atalanta to play its Champions League matches in Bergamo starting in the 2020–21 season. The final phase will feature a rebuilt "Curva Sud" (mirroring the rebuilt "Curva Nord"), which will increase the stadium's capacity to about 25,000, as well as construction of a new underground parking garage and other improvements to the stadium's surroundings. It was originally expected to be completed in 2021, though following several delays, the start of construction its completion is expected by August 2024, with demolition of the "Curva Sud" beginning in June 2023. Atalanta will still be able to play its home matches at the Gewiss Stadium during construction, though the stadium will have a capacity of 3,500 fewer spectators.
The stadium in Bergamo has also been used as a home ground by local Serie C club AlbinoLeffe from 2003 to 2019 (when it moved to Gorgonzola), a period during which AlbinoLeffe spent nine years in Serie B and met Atalanta on several occasions. On occasion, Atalanta's youth team also plays competitive matches at the Gewiss Stadium, most recently the Supercoppa Primavera in 2021.
Training ground.
Atalanta trains at the Centro Sportivo Bortolotti in Zingonia, a complex first constructed during the community's development in the 1960s, before being acquired for Atalanta by president Achille Bortolotti and inaugurated in 1977. The complex is used by the senior team for training and some friendlies, and the youth teams for training and home matches in youth competitions such as the Campionato Primavera 1. Atalanta's renowned youth academy ("Scuola di Calcio"; see below) is also based in Zingonia, and has been a continuous point of investment for the club since its establishment.
Supporters.
&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Quote_box/styles.css" /&gt;
"Being a fan of Atalanta is part of the identity of Bergamo."
 —Local newspaper "L'Eco di Bergamo" editor-in-chief Andrea Valesini (translated), 2020
According to a 2022 survey[ [update]], Atalanta is the 9th-most supported club in Italy, with an estimated 314,000 supporters. Although Atalanta supporters are vastly outnumbered in Italy by fans of more titled clubs, the club's performances in recent years have drawn additional support, especially among younger generations. An increase of 43% was reported since 2019, peaking at about 350,000 in 2021, and decreasing by 10% after the club failed to qualify for European competition in 2022. The club has also worked to grow its fanbase with the "Neonati Atalantini" initiative, implemented in 2010 by president Percassi, which gifts a free Atalanta replica shirt to all newborns born within the city limits of Bergamo. As of 2020[ [update]], over 36,000 shirts have been distributed; similar programs have been more recently adopted by other Italian clubs as well.
Most of the club's fans reside within the Province of Bergamo; conversely, there are very strong ties between Atalanta and Bergamo's residents, who often gather together in close-knit groups in support of the club. Atalanta supporters ("tifosi") are considered to be among the most passionate and loyal fans in Italy. Atalanta's Ultras gather mostly in the "Curva Nord" as the unified group Curva Nord 1907, formed from members of various Ultras groups under the leadership of Claudio "Il Bocia" Galimberti during the early 2000s. The "Curva Nord" Ultras were historically leftist but are now apolitical. A separate Ultras group, Forever Atalanta, gathers in the "Curva Sud", and is believed to still be leftist. Atalanta Ultras have a reputation as one of the most violent Ultras groups in Italy, self-describing as "we hate everybody", and indeed having few friends and many strong rivalries. The club and its Ultras have been punished on multiple occasions by the Italian Football League for violent or racist conduct.
On match days, the "Curva Nord" often features flares, fireworks, and choreography, and sometimes is covered by a large black-and-blue striped flag (see image). During the 2018–19 season, Atalanta matches had an average home attendance of 18,248, of whom an estimated 15,676 were season ticket holders.
Since 2002, Atalanta supporters have organized "La Festa della Dea" (the Festival of the Goddess), a multi-day festival to celebrate the club, almost every summer. The celebration features music, local cuisine, and reverence for the club's history, management, and players (both former and current players). Some contemporary players and coaches also have appeared at the celebration, most recently in 2018.
Friendships and rivalries.
Atalanta supporters have a long-standing friendship ("gemellaggio"; twinning) with supporters of Ternana. The friendship between the two clubs' supporters is one of the oldest and strongest in Italy, persevering since the 1980s. Historically, both clubs' Ultras were brought together by shared political views, and they frequently visit the other club's "Curva". Supporters of the club also have a historical twinning with supporters of German club Eintracht Frankfurt, a friendship similarly rooted in shared political views. There are also friendly relations between fans of Atalanta and fans of Spezia (since Atalanta's run in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1988), Cosenza, Cavese, and Austrian club Wacker Innsbruck.
Atalanta supporters share their most intense rivalry with supporters of nearby club Brescia. Meetings between the two clubs are sometimes known as the "Derby Lombardo" (Lombard Derby). This rivalry has its roots in a historical feud between Bergamo and Brescia dating back to the Middle Ages, beginning in 1126 when Bergamo expanded its territory by acquiring land put up for sale by Brescia; this led to a series of territorial disputes and armed conflicts between the two cities, among them the Battle of Cortenuova in 1237. Although armed conflict eventually ended and both cities were unified under the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, the cities' historical rivalry has defined the atmosphere of matches between Atalanta and Brescia for the entirety of the clubs' history. In 1993, tension between the clubs' supporters escalated further following a match (won 2–0 by Brescia) that was suspended three times due to violence in the stands, which resulted in over 20 spectators being hospitalized.
Since at least 1977, a heartfelt rivalry has existed between fans of Atalanta and Torino. There have been various altercations between the clubs' Ultras during matches between the clubs, though some fans share a mutual respect or consider each other "respected enemies". The Atalanta–Torino rivalry also gave rise to a short-lived friendship (lasting until the early 1980s) between supporters of Atalanta and Juventus—Torino's city rival—though Atalanta supporters now also consider Juventus a hated rival. In addition to Juventus, there are also strong rivalries between Atalanta and Italy's other well-supported clubs: Roma, Milan, Inter, Napoli, and Lazio, and Fiorentina. The rivalry between Atalanta and Roma emerged in 1984 after once-friendly relations between the two clubs' Ultras deteriorated. Milan and Atalanta have had a long-standing rivalry fueled by the friendship between fans of Brescia and Milan as well as a controversial episode during a Coppa Italia match in 1990 that infuriated the Atalanta fans. Matches between Inter and Atalanta have seen violence among Ultras since the early 1970s, fueled by political differences as well as the clubs' shared black and blue colors. Atalanta's rivalry with Lazio has been historically characterized by opposing political views—respectively far left against far right—though has greatly intensified following Lazio's Coppa Italia triumph over Atalanta in 2019. The rivalry between Atalanta and Fiorentina has intensified during Gian Piero Gasperini's tenure as Atalanta manager (also corresponding to Atalanta's qualification to European competitions); multiple tense episodes have occurred during and after matches between the two clubs. There are also strong rivalries between supporters of Atalanta and supporters of Bologna, Como (a regional rivalry since the 1980s), Genoa, Hellas Verona, Pisa, and Vicenza, as well as Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb.

Managers.
Atalanta's current manager (head coach) is Gian Piero Gasperini, who assumed the role on 14 June 2016. The club has had a total of 59 managers (including player-managers, assistants acting as head coach, and caretaker managers) since the club hired its first professional coach, Cesare Lovati, in 1925. Current manager Gasperini, who led the club to its highest league finishes and UEFA Champions League qualification between 2019 and 2021, has the most appearances as manager in the club's history (331 as of 4  2023[ [update]]) and the longest uninterrupted tenure as Atalanta manager (seven consecutive seasons). The club's second-longest-serving manager is Emiliano Mondonico, who oversaw 299 matches in all competitions—including a European Cup Winners' Cup and a UEFA Cup—in two spells (1987–90 and 1994–98). Stefano Colantuono, who also was manager on two different occasions (2005–07 and 2010–15), is the club's third-longest serving manager, with 281 appearances in total.
 "As of 13 October 2023"
Finances and ownership.
Presidential history.
Atalanta have had several presidents (chairmen) ( or ) over the course of their history. Some of them have been the main shareholder of the club. The longest-serving chairman is Ivan Ruggeri, who was relieved of his duties after he suffered a stroke in January 2008, being replaced by his son Alessandro who was named chairman of Atalanta in September 2008. Alessandro's father was unable to manage the team due to the consequences of the stroke.
In June 2010, after another relegation to Serie B, Alessandro Ruggeri sold his share of the club to Antonio Percassi, who became the new chairman of Atalanta.
 "As of 13 March 2023"
Youth system.
The Atalanta youth system consists of four men's teams that participate in separate national leagues (Primavera, Allievi Nazionali A and B, and Giovanissimi Nazionali) and two that participate at a regional level (Giovanissimi Regionali A and B).
The first person who was committed to set up the Atalanta youth teams was Giuseppe Ciatto. Every organisational aspect was dealt with and resolved by him, and he also took care to train the various teams. In 1949 Atalanta won the "Campionato Ragazzi".
In the late 1950s former Atalanta player Luigi Tentorio (then Special Commissioner of the club) felt the need to start investing more systematically in youth: he decided to create a real youth sector, with its own independent structure from the first team. The youth sector was entrusted to Giuseppe Brolis, who created a partnership with various clubs in the Veneto and Friuli regions, building a network of scouts and young coaches.
A crucial step in the history of the Bergamo youth sector took place in the early 1990s when the president Antonio Percassi implemented a new investment policy, especially at the youth level. He managed to convince Fermo Favini to leave Como and entrusted him with the responsibility of the youth sector.
The Atalanta youth system not only continued to increase the production of players for the first team, but began to win several honours in the most important national leagues. From 1991 to 2014, the various youth teams have won 17 national titles.
Apart from successes at youth level, the Atalanta youth system is also one of the most highly regarded in Europe: according to a ranking by the study centre in Coverciano, Atalanta have the top youth system in Italy and the sixth in Europe, behind Real Madrid, Barcelona and three French teams. The parameters used were the number of first division players produced by the club. In the 2007–08 season, 22 players from Atalanta's youth played in Serie A, 32 in Serie B and 3 abroad.
In 2014, a global study of the "CIES Football Observatory", placed the Atalanta youth system eighth place in the world, with 25 former youth players who play in the top 5 European leagues.

AC Ancona

Defunct Italian football club
Football club
Associazione Calcio Ancona, commonly referred to as Ancona, was an Italian football club based in Ancona, Marche. It was founded in 2004 as the phoenix club of defunct 1905 club Unione Sportiva Anconitana, which changed its name to Ancona Calcio in 1982. It used clause in the Article 52 of N.O.I.F.) with its last denomination. In 2010 it went bankrupt. Another club of the city, U.S. Ancona 1905 claimed as the phoenix club. However, the club also folded in 2017, with a second phoenix club, A.C. Anconitana, was founded in the Eccellenza. They merged with S.S. Matelica Calcio 1921 to found Ancona-Matelica, who aim to have their name changed back to just "Ancona" in 2022.
The nicknames of the team were "i Dorici" (The Dorians) and "i Biancorossi" (The Red and Whites).
History.
From U.S. Anconitana to Ancona Calcio.
Ancona had spells in Serie B before World War II and shortly after, but would not return to that level until 1988. Under coach Vincenzo Guerini, the club's rise was meteoric: 5th place in 1990 and promotion was achieved two years later. Although they would finish 17th and were relegated after just one year, the club nonetheless played in some memorable high-scoring games including a 3–0 home win over Inter. Midfielder Lajos Detari, winger Fabio Lupo and striker Massimo Agostini ensured Ancona had a respectable "Goals For" tally but conceded goals at an alarming rate.
The following year, Ancona reached a Coppa Italia final but were heavily beaten by Sampdoria. Near misses in the promotion race was followed by relegation in 1996 and again in 1998. After returning to Serie B in 2000, Ancona would achieve another promotion in 2003.
Its second Serie A season would be one of the worst of any Serie A club, with a record-equalling 28-game winless streak from the start. They finished the season with a pitiful 13 points. This was followed by bankruptcy and condemnation to Serie C2.
AC Ancona.
Ancona finished 5th in 2005–2006 season and lost promotion play-off against Sassuolo by finishing best place but promoted after expulsions of Gela and Sassari Torres due to financial troubles. They finished 16th in Serie C1/B and played relegation play-off against Teramo in 2006–2007 season. Ancona won 4–2 by aggregate and remained in Serie C1.
In October 2007 it was reported that Centro Sportivo Italiano (CSI), run by the Vatican's Conference of Bishops, had purchased an 80% share in the club. The report read:
"It is a way to moralise football, to bring some ethics to a sector that is going through a deep crisis of values," said Ancona Archbishop Edoardo Menichelli, who recently played a benefit game against an Italy national team of singers.
CSI president Edio Costantini said the centre wanted "to invest in the true meaning of sport. We want football to be again a means of education and not tied to strictly monetary values".
"We will show that, for boys, football is not just an illusion or a bad example."
According to Catholic World News on 9 October 2007, the Vatican was distancing itself from the move, claiming the CSI was a group of 'lay Catholics' and the Vatican had 'nothing to do' with the project. Yet in a Reuters report on 11 October 2007, both the Vatican Secretary of State and the Pope endorsed the move, quoted as saying respectively:
Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone praised the project in a statement read at its presentation, saying it was designed to 'bring out the human and spiritual values in sport'.
Pope Benedict XVI also encouraged the team after receiving a shirt with his name and the number 16 on from them at a general audience in St Peter's Square
The club has had several Papal connections. The 'Project Soccer' initiative was blessed by Pope Benedict XVI with a letter sent by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone to the Centro Sportivo Italiano. The 'Del Conero' stadium was visited by Pope John Paul II twice.
The club has been promoted back to Serie B after winning promotion playoff after defeating Perugia by finished best place and Taranto by 2–1 aggregate in 2007–2008 season. Ancona finished 19th at Serie B at next season and faced with Rimini at play-outs. Ancona won them with a 2–1 aggregate and remained in it.
The liquidation.
Ancona played the 2009–10 season in Serie B, finishing 17th despite 2 points deduction due to financial irregularities in the season and avoiding relegation, but eventually filed for bankruptcy and was unable to join any of the lower divisions. The club, however, managed to submit application for a place in Terza Categoria, the lowest level of the Italian football league system. Their application was accepted on 13 September 2010, as they were granted a playing ground by the city administration. However, they were still lacking players and a manager and were subsequently forced to forfeit the first four games of the season. According to FIGC regulations, this led to the club's removal from the league and they underwent liquidation.
Notable former players.
"This list of former players includes those who received international caps while playing for the team, made significant contributions to the team in terms of appearances or goals while playing for the team, or who made significant contributions to the sport either before they played for the team, or after they left. It is clearly not yet complete and all inclusive, and additions and refinements will continue to be made over time."

AS Roma

Football club in Rome, Italy
Football club
Associazione Sportiva Roma ("Rome Sport Association"), commonly referred to as Roma (), is a professional football club based in Rome, Italy. Established through a merger in 1927, Roma has maintained a consistent presence in the top tier of Italian football throughout its history, barring the 1951–52 season. Roma has won Serie A three times, in 1941–42, 1982–83 and 2000–01, as well as nine ' titles and two ' titles. In European competitions, Roma won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960–61 and the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2021–22, while they finished runners-up in the 1983–84 European Cup, the 1990–91 UEFA Cup and the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League.
Noteworthy players who have represented Roma include sixteen FIFA World Cup winners: Attilio Ferraris and Enrique Guaita (1934); Guido Masetti and Eraldo Monzeglio (1934 and 1938); Aldo Donati and Pietro Serantoni (1938); Bruno Conti (1982); Rudi Völler and Thomas Berthold (1990); Aldair (1994); Vincent Candela (1998); Cafu (2002); Daniele De Rossi, Simone Perrotta; Francesco Totti (2006) and Paulo Dybala (2022).
Since 1953, Roma has called the Stadio Olimpico home, sharing the venue with city rivals Lazio. With a seating capacity exceeding 72,000, the stadium ranks as the second-largest in Italy, surpassed only by the San Siro. Although plans for a new stadium are in place, construction has yet to commence. Known for their intense local rivalry, Roma and Lazio engage in the Derby della Capitale.
The club's home colours are carmine red and golden yellow, which gives Roma its nickname "I Giallorossi" ("The Yellow and Reds"). These colours have often been combined with white shorts. The club badge features a she-wolf, an allusion to the founding myth of Rome.
History.
Foundation.
AS Roma was founded in the spring of 1927 when Italo Foschi initiated the merger of three older Italian Football Championship clubs from the city of Rome: Roman FC, SS Alba-Audace and Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS. Foschi was an important Roman representative of the ruling National Fascist Party.
The purpose of the merger was to give the Italian capital a strong club to rival that of the more dominant Northern Italian clubs of the time. The only major Roman club to resist the merger was Lazio because of the intervention of the army General Vaccaro, a member of the club and executive of Italian Football Federation (FIGC).
All three founding clubs were relegated, but the fascist-aligned FIGC bet over the capacity of the new team to give a stronger representation to the capital of Italy, and they were awarded a wild card for the , the Serie A forerunner. The club played its earliest seasons at the Motovelodromo Appio stadium, before settling in the working-class streets of Testaccio, where it built an all-wooden ground Campo Testaccio; this was opened in November 1929. An early season in which Roma made a large mark was the 1930–31 championship, where the club finished as runners-up behind . Captain Attilio Ferraris, along with Guido Masetti, Fulvio Bernardini and Rodolfo Volk, were highly important players during this period.
First title victory and decline.
After a slump in league form and the departure of high key players, Roma eventually rebuilt their squad, adding goalscorers such as the Argentine Enrique Guaita. Under the management of Luigi Barbesino, the Roman club came close to their first title in 1935–36, finishing just one point behind champions Bologna.
Roma returned to form after being inconsistent for much of the late 1930s. Roma recorded an unexpected title triumph in the 1941–42 season by winning their first title. The 18 goals scored by local player Amedeo Amadei were essential to the Alfréd Schaffer-coached Roma side winning the title. At the time, Italy was involved in the Second World War, and Roma were playing at the Stadio Nazionale PNF.
In the years just after the war, Roma were unable to recapture their league stature from the early 1940s. Roma finished in the lower half of Serie A for five seasons in a row, before eventually succumbing to their only ever relegation to Serie B at the end of the 1950–51 season, around a decade after their championship victory. Under future Italy national team manager Giuseppe Viani, promotion straight back up was achieved.
After returning to the Serie A, Roma managed to stabilise themselves as a top-half club again with players such as Egisto Pandolfini, Dino da Costa and Dane Helge Bronée. Their best finish of this period was under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver, when in 1954–55, they finished as runners-up after Udinese, who originally finished second, were relegated for corruption. Although Roma were unable to break into the top four during the following decade, they did achieve some measure of cup success. Their first honour outside of Italy was recorded in 1960–61 when Roma won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup by defeating Birmingham City 4–2 in the finals. A few years later, Roma won their first Coppa Italia trophy in 1963–64, after defeating Torino 1–0.
Their lowest point came during the 1964–65 season, when manager Juan Carlos Lorenzo announced the club could not pay its players and was unlikely to be able to afford to travel to Vicenza to fulfil its next fixture. Supporters kept the club going with a fundraiser at the Sistine Theatre and bankruptcy was avoided with the election of a new club president Franco Evangelisti.
Their second Coppa Italia trophy was won in 1968–69, when it competed in a small, league-like system. Giacomo Losi set a Roma appearance record in 1969 with 450 appearances in all competitions, a record that would last 38 years.
Time of mixed fortunes from the 1970s to the 1990s.
Roma were able to add another cup to their collection in 1972, with a 3–1 victory over Blackpool in the Anglo-Italian Cup. During much of the 1970s, Roma's appearance in the top half of Serie A was sporadic. The best place the club were able to achieve during the decade was third in 1974–75. Notable players who turned out for the club during this period included midfielders Giancarlo De Sisti and Francesco Rocca.
The dawning of a newly successful era in Roma's footballing history was brought in with another Coppa Italia victory; they defeated Torino on penalties to win the 1979–80 edition. Roma would reach heights in the league which they had not touched since the 1940s by narrowly and controversially finishing as runners-up to in 1980–81. Former Milan player Nils Liedholm was the manager at the time, with players such as Bruno Conti, Agostino Di Bartolomei, Roberto Pruzzo and Falcão.
The second "scudetto" did not elude Roma for much longer. In 1982–83, the Roman club won the title for the first time in 41 years, amidst celebrations in the capital. The following season, Roma finished as runners-up in Italy and collected a Coppa Italia title; they also finished as runners-up in the European Cup final of 1984. The European Cup final with Liverpool ended in a 1–1 draw with a goal from Pruzzo, but Roma eventually lost in the penalty shoot-out. Roma's successful run in the 1980s would finish with a runners-up spot in 1985–86 and a Coppa Italia victory, beating out Sampdoria 3–2.
Afterwards, a comparative decline began in the league, one of the few league highs from the following period being a third-place finish in 1987–88. At the start of the 1990s, the club was involved in an all-Italian UEFA Cup final, which they lost 2–1 to in 1991. The same season, the club won its seventh Coppa Italia and ended runners-up to Sampdoria in the Supercoppa Italiana. Aside from finishing runners-up to Torino in a Coppa Italia final, the rest of the decade was largely sub-par in the history of Roma, particularly in the league, where the highest they could manage was fourth in 1997–98. The early 1990s also saw the emergence of homegrown striker Francesco Totti, who would go on to be an important member of the team and the club's iconic captain.
Third "scudetto" in the Sensi era.
Roma won their third Serie A title in 2000–01. The "Scudetto" was won on the last day of the season after defeating Parma 3–1, edging Juventus by two points. The club's captain, Francesco Totti, was a large reason for the title victory and he would become one of the main heroes in the club's history, going on to break several club records. Other important players during this period included: Aldair, Cafu, Gabriel Batistuta and Vincenzo Montella.
In the 2001–02 Serie A, Roma ended as runners-up to Juventus by one point. This would be the start of Roma finishing as runners-up several times in both Serie A and Coppa Italia during the 2000s – they lost out 4–2 to Milan in the Coppa Italia final of 2003, and lost to Milan again by finishing second in Serie A for the 2003–04 season. The club also re-capitalized several time in 2003–04 season. In November 2003, €37.5 million was injected by "Roma 2000" to cover the half-year loss and loss carried from the previous year, and again on 30 June for €44.57 million. Through stock market, a further €19.850 million of new shares issued, and at the year end, the share capital was €19.878 million, which was unchanged as of 2011[ [update]]. The following season also saw the departure of Walter Samuel for €25 million and Emerson for €28 million, which decreased the strength of the squad. The "Giallorossi" finished in eighth place, one of the worst of recent seasons.
On 9 July 2006, Roma's Francesco Totti, Daniele De Rossi and Simone Perrotta were part of the Italy national team which defeated France in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final. In the "Calciopoli" scandal of 2006, Roma were not one of the teams involved. After punishments were issued, Roma was re-classified as runners-up for 2005–06, the same season they finished second in the Coppa Italia losing to Internazionale. In the two following seasons, 2006–07 and 2007–08, Roma finished as Serie A runners-up, meaning that in the 2000s, Roma finished in the top two positions more than any other decade in their history. Meanwhile, in the UEFA Champions League during both of these seasons, they reached the quarter-finals before going out to Manchester United. In the 2008–09 Champions League, Roma reached the knockout stage ahead of Chelsea in their group, thus finishing for the first time in their history as winners of the group stage. However, they lost to Arsenal in the knockout stage on penalty kicks.
After a disappointing start to the 2009–10 season, Claudio Ranieri replaced Luciano Spalletti as head coach. At the time of the switch, Roma lay bottom of the Serie A table after losses to Juventus and Genoa. Despite this setback, Roma went on unbeaten streak of 24 matches in the league – with the last of the 24 being a 2–1 win over rivals Lazio, whereby they came from 1–0 down at half-time to defeat their city rivals after Ranieri substituted both Totti and De Rossi at the interval. The "Giallorossi" were on top of the table at one point, before a loss to Sampdoria later in the season. Roma would finish runners-up to Internazionale yet again in both Serie A and the Coppa Italia. During the 2000s, Roma had finally recaptured the "Scudetto", two Coppa Italia trophies, and their first two Supercoppa Italiana titles. Other notable contributions to the club's history included a return to the Champions League quarter-finals (in the 2006–07 and 2007–08 editions) since 1984, six runners up positions in the league, four Coppa Italia finals and three Supercoppa finals – marking Roma's greatest ever decade.
American ownership and Pallotta era.
In the summer of 2010, the Sensi family agreed to relinquish their control of Roma as part of a debt-settlement agreement, ending their reign that had begun in 1993. Until a new owner was appointed, Rosella Sensi continued her directorial role of the club. Following a series of poor results that saw Roma engage in a winless streak of five consecutive matches, Claudio Ranieri resigned as head coach in February 2011, and former striker Vincenzo Montella was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. It was also during this season that Roma icon Francesco Totti scored his 200th Serie A goal against Fiorentina in March 2011, becoming only the sixth player to achieve such a feat.
On 16 April 2011, the takeover contract was closed with an American investment group led by Thomas R. DiBenedetto, with James Pallotta, Michael Ruane and Richard D'Amore as partners. DiBenedetto became the 22nd president of the club, serving from 27 September 2011 to 27 August 2012, and was succeeded by Pallotta. The new intermediate holding company, NEEP Roma Holding, was 60% owned by American's "AS Roma SPV, LLC" and the rest (40%) was retained by the creditor of Sensi, UniCredit. In turn, NEEP owned all shares held previously by Sensi (about 67%) with the rest free float in the stock market. UniCredit later disinvested NEEP Roma Holding to sell to "AS Roma SPV, LLC" and Pallotta.
The new ownership hired Walter Sabatini as director of football and former Spanish international and Barcelona B coach Luis Enrique as manager. Signings included attacking midfielder Erik Lamela from River Plate and forward Bojan from Barcelona, as well as Dani Osvaldo and Miralem Pjanić. On the pitch, the team were eliminated from 2011–12 UEFA Europa League play-off round by Slovan Bratislava. In 2012, Pallotta became the new president. The 2012–13 pre-season started with the hiring of former manager Zdeněk Zeman. He was sacked on 2 February 2013, while the team ended up in sixth place in Serie A, and lost 1–0 to rivals Lazio in the Coppa Italia final. It was the first time that Lazio and Roma clashed in the Coppa Italia final. As a result, Roma missed out on European competition for the second-straight season.
On 12 June 2013, Rudi Garcia was appointed the new manager of Roma. He won his first ten matches (an all-time Serie A record) including a 2–0 derby win against Lazio, a 3–0 victory away to Internazionale and a 2–0 home win over title rivals Napoli. During this run, Roma scored 24 times while conceding just once, away to Parma. The club earned 85 points and finished second to Juventus, who won the league with a record-breaking 102 points. In 2014–15, Roma finished second behind Juventus for the second consecutive season after a poor run of form in 2015. At the end of season, the club was sanctioned for loss making and breaking UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations, being punished with a fine of up to €6 million and a limited squad for UEFA competitions.
Ahead of the 2015–16 season, Roma acquired Bosnia international, Edin Džeko, from Manchester City on a €4 million loan with an €11 million option to buy clause, which was activated. On 13 January 2016, Garcia was sacked after a run of one win in seven Serie A matches. Luciano Spalletti was subsequently appointed manager of Roma for his second spell. On 21 February, Totti publicly criticised Spalletti due to his own lack of playing-time since returning from injury. Consequently, Totti was subsequently dropped by Spalletti for Roma's 5–0 win over Palermo, with the decision causing an uproar among the fans and in the media. After their initial disagreements, Spalletti began to use Totti as an immediate impact substitute, and he contributed with four goals and one assist after coming off the bench in five consecutive Serie A matches. Spalletti was able to lead Roma from a mid-table spot to a third-place finish in Serie A, clinching the UEFA Champions League play-off spot.
During the summer of 2016, Roma lost midfielder Miralem Pjanić to rivals Juventus to improve its financial position. On 27 April 2017, Roma appointed sporting director Monchi, formerly of Sevilla FC. On 28 May that year, on the last day of the 2016–17 season, Totti made his 786th and final appearance for Roma before retiring in a 3–2 home win against Genoa, coming on as a substitute for Mohamed Salah in the 54th minute and received a standing ovation from the fans. The win saw Roma finish second in Serie A behind Juventus. Daniele De Rossi succeeded Totti as club captain and signed a new two-year contract.
On 13 June 2017, former Roma player Eusebio Di Francesco was appointed as the club's new manager, replacing Spalletti, who had left for Internazionale. Roma again lost a key player during the summer transfer window, with Mohamed Salah joining Liverpool F.C. for a fee of €39 million (£34m). Several new players joined the club, including a club-record deal of up to €40 million for Sampdoria striker Patrik Schick. In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League Roma were drawn against FC Barcelona in the quarter-finals, being defeated 4–1 away in the first leg but winning 3–0 in the second to advance on away goals to the semi-finals for the first time since 1984. Roma then lost to Liverpool, the team that had defeated them in the 1984 European Cup Final 7–6 on aggregate. Roma ended the 2017–18 season in 3rd place on 77 points, qualifying for the following season's Champions League.
In the summer of 2018, Roma were busy in the transfer market, in large parts thanks to the €83 million they received from reaching the Champions League semi-finals, as well as selling goalkeeper Alisson for a world record €72 million including bonuses to Liverpool. Roma spent €150 million to sign the likes of Shick, Nzonzi, Pastore, Kluivert, Defrel and more, while selling their two starting midfielders from the previous season, Nainggolan and Strootman. The 2018-19 season saw the club eliminated against Porto 4–3 on aggregate in the Champions League round of 16; Di Francesco was sacked and replaced by Claudio Ranieri who served as caretaker manager. The following day, sporting director Monchi stepped down due to disagreements with Pallotta; the club president disputed his account In Monchi's two years at the club, he spent £208 million on 21 signings, while when he left, 12 of his signings remained at the club. Under Ranieri, Roma failed to qualify for the Champions League, finishing 6th.
Friedkin era and European success.
In December 2019, AS Roma SPV LLC was in final negotiations to sell the team for $872 million, to American businessman Dan Friedkin, however negotiations stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 6 August 2020, Friedkin signed the preliminary contract to agree to pay $591 million to Pallotta, the main shareholder of Roma.
Paulo Fonseca, who was hired as manager in 2019, left two years later and was replaced by fellow Portuguese José Mourinho. On 25 May 2022, he led Roma to win the inaugural edition of UEFA Europa Conference League, defeating Feyenoord in the final.
Club identity.
Roma's colours of carmine red with a golden yellow trim represents the traditional colours of Rome, the official seal of the Comune di Roma features the same colours. The gold and the purple-red represent Roman imperial dignity. White shorts and black socks are usually worn with the red shirt. However, in particularly high key matches, the shorts and socks are the same colour as the home shirt.
The kit itself was originally worn by "Roman Football Club"; one of the three clubs who merged to form the current incarnation in 1927. Because of the colours they wear, Roma are often nicknamed "i giallorossi" meaning the yellow-reds. Roma's away kit is traditionally white, with a third kit changing colour from time to time.
A popular nickname for the club is "i lupi" ("the wolves") – the animal has always featured on the club's badge in different forms throughout their history. The emblem of the team is currently the one which was used when the club was first founded. It portrays the female wolf with the two infant brothers Romulus and Remus, illustrating the myth of the founding of Rome, superimposed on a bipartite golden yellow over a maroon red shield. In the myth from which the club takes their nickname and logo, the twins (sons of Mars and Rhea Silvia) are thrown into the river Tiber by their uncle Amulius. A she-wolf then saved the twins and looked after them. Eventually, the two twins took revenge on Amulius before falling out themselves – Romulus killed Remus and was thus made king of a new city named in his honour, Rome.
Facilities.
Stadiums.
The first sport facility Roma used was the Motovelodromo Appio, previously used by Alba-Audace. Roma only played the 1927–28 season there until they moved to Campo Testaccio the very next season. Campo Testaccio was used through 1929 to 1940. The team moved later to the Stadio Nazionale del PNF, where they spent 13 years before moving once again.
In the 1953–54 season, Roma moved to the Olympic arena, Stadio Olimpico, which it shares with Lazio. The arena has undergone several changes over the years The most significant change took place in the nineties when Stadio Olimpico was demolished and then reconstructed for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, held in Italy. Roma have played almost every season since 1953–54, with the exception of the 1989–90 seasons, due to the reconstruction of Stadio Olimpico. That year, Roma played its home matches at Stadio Flaminio.
On 30 December 2012, Roma club president James Pallotta announced the construction of a new stadium in the Tor di Valle area of Rome. The new stadium, Stadio della Roma, would have a capacity of 52,500 spectators. On 2 February 2017, the Region of Lazio and the mayor of Rome rejected the proposal to build a new stadium. However, it was later approved on 24 February after final review of the stadium's design adjustments. In August 2017, the stadium suffered another delay, forcing Roma to renew their lease with the Stadio Olimpico until 2020. It is presently uncertain when the stadium will open. On 5 December 2017, the Stadio della Roma project, after experiencing five years worth of delays due to conflicting interests from various parties in the Roman city government, was given the go-ahead to begin construction, with the stadium expected to be ready to open for the 2020–21 season. On 26 February 2021, it was announced that the stadium project had been halted.
Trigoria.
A sports centre located in Trigoria at kilometre 3600 in south-east of Rome was purchased on 22 July 1977 by then club president Gaetano Anzalone. It was opened on 23 July 1979 as Anzalone's final act as president. The complex had its first expansion in 1984 when the club was handled by Dino Viola and another in 1998 under the chairmanship of Franco Sensi. The centre's official name is the Fulvio Bernardini di Trigoria, named after club icon Fulvio Bernardini.
On 4 September 2019, the Trigoria training ground began to serve also as a private school named 'Liceo Scientifico Sportivo A.S. Roma', exclusively educating only the team's youth players in a renovated building on the training ground premises. 80 students are currently enrolled in the school, which features its own cafeteria and gym.
The centre is also known for hosting the Argentina national team during the 1990 FIFA World Cup, held in Italy.
Supporters.
Roma is the fifth-most supported football club in Italy – behind Juventus, Internazionale, AC Milan and Napoli – with approximately 7% of Italian football fans supporting the club, according to the Doxa Institute-L'Espresso's research of April 2006. Historically, the largest section of Roma supporters in the city of Rome have come from the inner-city, especially Testaccio.
The traditional ultras group of the club was "Commando Ultrà Curva Sud" commonly abbreviated as "CUCS". This group was founded by the merger of many smaller groups and was considered one of the most historic in the history of European football. However, by the mid-1990s, "CUCS" had been usurped by rival factions and ultimately broke up. Since that time, the "Curva Sud" of the Stadio Olimpico has been controlled by more right-wing groups, including "A.S. Roma Ultras", "Boys" and "Giovinezza", among others. However, the oldest group, "Fedayn", is apolitical, and politics is not the main identity of Roma, just a part of their overall identity. Besides ultras groups, it is believed Roma fans support the left as opposed to Lazio supporters, which are notoriously proud of their right-wing affiliation.
In November 2015, Roma's ultras and their Lazio counterparts boycotted Roma's 1–0 victory in the "Derby della Capitale" in protest at new safety measures imposed at the Stadio Olimpico. The measures – imposed by Rome's prefect, Franco Gabrielli – had involved plastic glass dividing walls being installed in both the Curva Sud and Curva Nord, splitting the sections behind each goal in two. Both sets of ultras continued their protests for the rest of the season, including during Roma's 4–1 victory in the return fixture. Lazio's ultras returned to the Curva Nord for Roma's 1–4 victory in December 2016, but the Roma ultras continue to boycott matches.
The most known club anthem is "Roma (non-si discute, si ama)", also known as "Roma Roma", by singer Antonello Venditti. The title roughly means, "Roma is not to be questioned, it is to be loved," and it is sung before each match. The song "Grazie Roma", by the same singer, is played at the end of victorious home matches. Recently, the main riff of The White Stripes' song "Seven Nation Army" has also become widely popular at matches.
Rivalries.
In Italian football, Roma is a club with many rivalries; first and foremost is their rivalry with Lazio, the club with whom they share the Stadio Olimpico. The derby between the two is called the "Derby della Capitale", it is amongst the most heated and emotional footballing rivalries in the world. The fixture has seen some occasional instances of violence in the past, including the death of Lazio fan Vincenzo Paparelli in 1979–80 as a result of an emergency flare fired from the Curva Sud, and the abandonment of a match in March 2004 following unfounded rumours of a fatality which led to violence outside the stadium.
Against Napoli, Roma also compete in the "Derby del Sole", meaning the "Derby of the Sun". Nowadays, fans also consider other Juventus (a rivalry born especially in the 1980s), Milan, Atalanta (since 1984, when friendly relations between the two clubs' ultras deteriorated), and Internazionale (increased in recent years) among their rivals, as they are often competitors for the top four spots in the league table and qualification for the UEFA Champions League.
Hooliganism.
Rivalries with other teams have escalated into serious violence. A group of ultras who label themselves the Fedayn — 'the devotees' — after a group of long-forgotten Iranian guerrilla fighters are regarded to be responsible for the organised hooliganism. In 2014 Daniele De Santis, a Roma ultra, was convicted of shooting Ciro Esposito and two others during clashes with Napoli fans who were in Rome for their club's Coppa Italia final against Fiorentina. Esposito died of his wounds. De Santis was sentenced to 26 years in prison, later reduced to 16 years on appeal. Roma ultras have displayed banners celebrating De Santis.
There have been multiple instances of Roma ultras attacking supporters of foreign clubs when playing in Rome. These attacks have regularly featured the Roma ultras using knives, poles, flares, bottles and stones on unarmed foreign supporters, resulting in multiple hospitalisations.

Chairmen history.
Roma have had numerous chairmen ( or ) over the course of their history, some of which have been the owners and co-owners of the club, some of them were nominated by the owners. Franco Sensi was the chairman until his death in 2008, with his daughter, Roma CEO Rosella Sensi taking his place as chairman. Here is a complete list of Roma chairmen from 1927 until the present day.
Managerial history.
Roma have had many managers and trainers running the team during their history, here is a chronological list of them from 1927 onwards.
Hall of Fame.
On 7 October 2012, the AS Roma Hall of Fame was announced.
The Hall of Fame players were voted via the club's official website and a special Hall of Fame panel. In 2013 four players were voted in. In 2014, the third year of AS Roma Hall of Fame four more players were voted in.
Club records and statistics.
Francesco Totti currently holds Roma's official appearance record, having made 786 appearances in all competitions, over the course of 25 seasons from 1993 until 2017. He also holds the record for Serie A appearances with 619, as he passed Giacomo Losi on 1 March 2008 during a home match against Parma.
Including all competitions, Totti is the all-time leading goalscorer for Roma with 307 goals since joining the club, 250 of which were scored in Serie A (another Roma record). Roberto Pruzzo, who was the all-time topscorer since 1988, comes in second in all competitions with 138. In 1930–31, Rodolfo Volk scored 29 goals in Serie A over the course of a single season. Not only was Volk the league's top scorer that year, he also set a Roma record for most goals scored in a season which would later be matched by Edin Džeko in 2016–17.
Its major founders Fortitudo and Alba having been relegated at the end of 1926–27 campaign, new-founded Roma had to take part to Southern First Division championship (Serie B) for its inaugural season. Nevertheless, the FIGC decided on a special enlargement of first level division re-admitting AS Roma and SSC Napoli. The first ever official matches participated in by Roma was in the National Division, the predecessor of Serie A, of 1927–28, against Livorno, a 2–0 Roma win. Calcio e Finanza calculations showed Mourinho cost Roma about €3.5 million for each Serie A point he won. An appointment that turned out to be the worst big-money signing in Roma history. The biggest ever victory recorded by Roma was 9–0 against Cremonese during the 1929–30 Serie A season. The heaviest defeat Roma have ever suffered is 1–7, which has occurred five times; against Juventus in 1931–32, Torino in 1947–48, Manchester United in 2006–07, Bayern Munich in 2014–15 and Fiorentina in 2018–19.

As a company.
Since 1999, during Franco Sensi's period in charge, Associazione Sportiva Roma has been a listed on Borsa Italiana. From 2004 to 2011, Roma's shares are distributed between; 67.1% to Compagnia Italpetroli SpA (the Sensi family "holding"; Banca di Roma later acquired 49% stake on Italpetroli due to debt restructuring) and 32.9% to other public shareholders.
Along with Lazio and Juventus, Roma is one of only three quotated Italian clubs. According to The Football Money League published by consultants Deloitte, in the 2010–11 season, Roma was the 15th highest-earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of €143.5 million.
In April 2008, after months of speculation, George Soros was confirmed by Rosella Sensi, CEO of Serie A club AS Roma, to be bidding for a takeover. The takeover bid was successively rejected by the Sensi family, who instead preferred to maintain the club's ownership. On 17 August 2008, club chairman and owner Franco Sensi died after a long illness; his place at the chairmanship of the club was successively taken by his daughter Rosella.
Since the takeover in 2011, NEEP Roma Holding S.p.A. has owned all shares Sensi previously hold. NEEP, itself a joint venture, was held by DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC (later renamed to AS Roma SPV, LLC) and Unicredit in 60–40 ratio from 2011 to 2013, which the former had four real person shareholders in equal ratio, led by future Roma president Thomas R. DiBenedetto (2011–12). The takeover also activated a mandatory bid of shares from the general public, however not all minority shareholders were willing to sell their shares. The mandatory bid meant NEEP held 78.038% of shares of AS Roma (increased from 67.1% of the Sensi). On 1 August 2013, the president of Roma, as well as one of the four American shareholders of AS Roma SPV, LLC, James Pallotta, bought an additional 9% shares of NEEP Roma Holding from Unicredit (through Raptor Holdco LLC), as the bank was not willing to fully participate in the capital increase of NEEP from €120,000 to €160,008,905 (excluding share premium). On 4 April 2014, Starwood Capital Group also became the fifth shareholder of AS Roma SPV, as well as forming a strategic partnership with AS Roma SpA to develop real estate around the new stadium. The private investment firm was represented by Zsolt Kohalmi in AS Roma SPV, who was appointed on 4 April as a partner and head of European acquisitions of the firm. On 11 August 2014, UniCredit sold the remain shares on NEEP (of 31%) for €33 million which meant AS Roma SPV LLC (91%) and Raptor Holdco LLC (9%) were the sole intermediate holding company of AS Roma SpA.
Since re-capitalization in 2003–04, Roma had a short-lived financial self-sustainability, until the takeover in 2011. The club had set up a special amortisation fund using Articolo 18-bis Legge 91/1981 mainly for the abnormal signings prior 2002–03 season, (such as Davide Bombardini for €11 million account value in June 2002, when the flopped player exchange boosted 2001–02 season result) and the tax payment of 2002–03 was rescheduled. In 2004–05, Roma made a net profit of €10,091,689 and followed by €804,285 in 2005–06. In 2006–07 season the accounting method changed to IFRS, which meant that the 2005–06 result was reclassified as net loss of €4,051,905 and 2006–07 season was net income of €10,135,539 (€14.011 million as a group). Moreover, the special fund (€80,189,123) was removed from the asset and co-currently for the equity as scheduled, meant Roma group had a negative equity of €8.795 million on 30 June 2007. Nevertheless, the club had sold the brand to a subsidiary which boost the profit in a separate financial statement, which "La Repubblica" described as "doping". In 2007–08, Roma made a net income of €18,699,219. (€19 million as a group) However, 2008–09 saw the decrease of gate and TV income, co-currently with finishing sixth in Serie A, which saw Roma make a net loss of €1,894,330. (€1.56 million as a group) The gate and TV income further slipped in 2009–10, with a net loss of €21,917,292 (already boosted by the sale of Alberto Aquilani; €22 million as a group), despite sporting success (finishing in second place in 2009–10). Moreover, despite a positive equity as a separate company (€105,142,589), the AS Roma Group had a negative equity on the consolidated balance sheet, and fell from +€8.8 million to −€13.2 million. In the 2010–11 season, Roma was administered by UniCredit as the Sensi family failed to repay the bank and the club was put on the market, and were expected to have a quiet transfer window. Concurrently, with no selling profit on the players, Roma's net loss rose to €30,589,137 (€30.778 million as a group) and the new owner had already planned a re-capitalization after the mandatory bid on the shares. On the positive side, TV income was increased from €75,150,744 to €78,041,642, and gate income increased from €23,821,218 to €31,017,179. This was because Roma entered the 2010–11 Champions League, which counter-weighed the effect of the new collective agreement of Serie A. In 2011–12, the renewal of squad and participation in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League had worsened the financial result, which the €50 million capital increase (in advance) was counter-weighted totally by the net loss. In the 2012–13 season, the participation in domestic league only, was not only not harmful to the revenue but increase in gate income as well as decrease in wage bill, however Roma still did not yet break even (€40.130 million net loss in consolidated accounts). NEEP Roma also re-capitalized AS Roma in advance for another €26,550,000 during 2012–13. A proposed capital increase by €100 million for Roma was announced on 25 June 2014; however, until 22 May 2014, NEEP already injected €108 million into the club, which depends on public subscription; more than €8 million would convert to medium-long-term loan from shareholder instead of becoming share capital. Another capital increase was carried in 2018.
A joint venture of Roma, which was owned by Roma (37.5%), SS Lazio (37.5%) and Parma FC (25%), Società Diritti Sportivi S.r.l., was in the process of liquidation since 2005. The company was a joint-venture of four football clubs, including Fiorentina. After the bankruptcy of Fiorentina however, both Roma and Lazio had increased their shares ratio from 25% to 37.5%. Another subsidiary, "Soccer S.A.S. di Brand Management S.r.l.", was a special-purpose entity (SPV) that Roma sold their brand to the subsidiary in 2007. In February 2015, another SPV, "ASR Media and Sponsorship S.r.l", was set up to secure a five-year bank loan of €175 million from Goldman Sachs, for three-month Euribor (min. 0.75%) + 6.25% spread (i.e. min. 7% interests rate p.a.).
In 2015, Inter and Roma were the only two Italian clubs that were sanctioned by UEFA for breaking UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations, which they signed settlement agreements with UEFA. It was followed by Milan in 2018.
Roma had compliance with the requirements and overall objective of the settlement agreement in 2018, which the club exited from settlement regime.
Superleague Formula.
AS Roma had a team in the Superleague Formula race car series where teams were sponsored by football clubs. Roma's driver was ex-IndyCar Series driver Franck Perera. The team had posted three podiums and was operated by Alan Docking Racing.

AC Monza

Association football club in Monza, Italy
Football club
Associazione Calcio Monza (; "Monza Football Association") is a professional football club based in Monza, Lombardy, Italy. The team plays in the Serie A, the first tier of Italian football, following promotion in the 2021–22 Serie B season.
The club was founded in 1912 as Monza FBC and on multiple occasions in the 1970s came close to promotion to the Serie A. At times during the first two decades of the 21st century, they faced financial issues; they were declared bankrupt twice, in 2004 and 2015. Following Silvio Berlusconi's 2018 takeover of the club, Monza returned to the Serie B in 2020 after a 19-year absence and reached promotion to Serie A for the first time in 2022. Before their promotion, no Italian team had played more Serie B seasons (40) without playing in the Serie A. Monza have won the Coppa Italia Serie C a record four times, the Serie C championship four times, and an Anglo-Italian Cup.
From the club's founding Monza's colours were blue and white, but were changed to red and white in 1932; as a result, the team are nicknamed (the white and reds). Monza have played their home games at the Stadio Brianteo since 1988. The team have rivalries with Como, Pro Sesto and Pisa.
History.
Foundation and first tournaments (1912–1927).
Monza Foot-Ball Club was founded on 1 September 1912 in the Cappello Vecchio , following the merger of the Monza-based clubs Pro Italia and Pro Monza. The new club established their first headquarters in the Roma coffeehouse located on the similarly named town square in Monza; the team initially wore a blue and white kit. Monza's first recorded game was against a team from Milan, while their first win came on 20 September 1912 when they beat Juventus Italia 2–1 in Triante. The club won their first trophy, the Coppa Colli, in early 1913 after beating Saronno 3–2 in the final.
In November 1913, Monza FBC merged with Juventus FBC (a group of athletes formerly part of the Forti e Liberi sports club) to form Associazione Calcio Monza. Monza first participated in the Terza Categoria (third level) in the 1913–14 season; they played their first match on 4 January 1914, losing 3–1 at home against Fanfulla. The following season, Monza took part in the Promozione (second level), finishing fourth in their group of six. Despite the outbreak of World War I, when conscription forced teams to send their adult players to war, Monza were able to continue their sporting activity with young players.
Between 1915 and 1918, the war interrupted official tournaments. Upon the resumption of football in 1919, Monza took part in the 1919–20 Promozione (second level). Having finished first in their group, Monza played the promotion finals against Trevigliese, losing 2–1. The Italian Football Federation, however, decided to promote Monza via repechage, and the team were allocated to the Prima Categoria, the top tier of Italian football. In 1919, Monza hosted the Czechoslovakia military national team for a friendly game at Grazie Vecchie field that ended in a 1–1 draw.
Monza were grouped with Milan, Cremonese and Pro Patria in their qualifying group for the Prima Categoria. Their first game was played on 24 October 1920, a 4–1 home defeat to Milan; Francesco Mandelli scored Monza's lone goal. They finished the 1920–21 season with no points and in last place in their group. The following season, Monza finished second in their group, missing out on the final stage by one position. Due to a restructuring of the league system, Monza were moved to the Seconda Divisione (second level) for the 1922–23 season; they avoided relegation by beating Chiasso and Canottieri Lecco in the play-offs. In 1926–27, after beating Ponziana 3–2 in the final, Monza were declared champions of the Seconda Divisione Lega Nord (third level) and were promoted to the Prima Divisione (second level).
and Serie B promotion (1932–1953).
During the 1930s and 1940s Monza played in the Prima Divisione (third level), which became the Serie C in 1935. In September 1932, ahead of the 1932–33 season, Monza changed their shirt colours to red and white, which they have worn ever since. They became nicknamed "" (the white and reds) following the colour change. Monza finished in first place the following season and played a round-robin tournament with three other teams for promotion to the Serie B (second level); they finished fourth and failed to move up to the second level. On 23 April 1939, the club reached the Coppa Italia quarter-finals, losing 2–1 to Serie A side Genoa. They became the first Serie C team to reach the quarter-finals of the competition.
Between 1942 and 1945, World War II interrupted football in Italy. Following the war, Monza were placed in the Serie C (third level), finishing eighth in the 1945–46 season. They came close to promotion the following season, finishing third in the promotion play-offs. In 1947, Peppino Borghi became president of Monza. Monza, who were coached by Annibale Frossi, headed into the 1950–51 Serie C with a strong transfer campaign. On 4 June 1951, Monza played away to Omegna in the season's second-to-last match; Carlo Colombetti of Monza scored the match's only goal with a penalty kick, giving Monza their first promotion into the Serie B.
Monza debuted in the Serie B on 9 September 1951, drawing to Siracusa 1–1 away from home. The team only avoided relegation on the last matchday with a 2–1 home win against Piombino. Against most experts' pre-season expectations, Monza finished the 1952–53 Serie B in fourth position, three points behind automatic promotion in second place.
Simmenthal merger and aftermath (1955–1967).
In July 1955, ahead of the 1955–56 season, Monza merged with Prima Divisione (sixth level) side GS Simmenthal, the football club of the Simmenthal food company. AC Monza was renamed AC Simmenthal-Monza, and was headed by Simmenthal owner Claudio Sada. The merger helped fund subsequent transfer campaigns. The match between Monza and Verona on 8 October 1955 was the first free-to-air televised match in Italy. Monza's first season under the new management was positive, finishing the season in third place. In the following years, until the end of their merger in 1964, Monza alternated positive seasons (fourth and fifth place in 1958 and 1961, respectively) with negative ones (16th and 15th in 1960 and 1964). On 14 July 1964, Simmenthal ceased to sponsor Monza and the club reverted to its former name.
Despite Monza's stable financial situation, no one was interested in purchasing the club; Sada decided to remain president for the following season. While Monza barely avoided relegation in the 1964–65 season, the same could not be said about the next season: following 15 years of second-tier football, Monza were relegated to the Serie C in the last matchday of the season, drawing 0–0 away to Mantova on 19 June 1966. After winning the 1966–67 play-off game against Como 1–0, thanks to a lone goal by Gianluigi Maggioni in the 32nd minute, Monza were promoted back to the Serie B after one year.
Serie A promotion attempts (1969–1979).
Three years after their Serie B promotion, Monza came close to reaching the Serie A for the first time in the 1969–70 Serie B under coach Luigi Radice; they needed an away win against first-placed Varese to keep their promotion chances alive on the second-to-last matchday. On 7 June 1970, after just two minutes of play, Monza took the lead through Roberto Caremi; in the sixth minute, Giampaolo Lanzetti failed to double the lead, wasting a clear chance in front of the goal. Varese won 2–1, preventing Monza from gaining promotion.
In mid-1972, Giovanni Cappelletti became president of the club. In his first year in charge, Monza were relegated to the Serie C after losing the last match of the 1972–73 season away to Bari 3–1. Despite their relegation, Monza saw success in the Coppa Italia Semiprofessionisti, reaching the finals in 1974, 1975 and 1976, winning the first two over Lecce and Sorrento, and losing the third in a repeat of the first final. Five matches before the end of the 1975–76 season, Monza were promoted back to the Serie B; they also won an Anglo-Italian Cup on 19 June 1976, beating Wimbledon 1–0 in the final through a Francesco Casagrande goal.
During the late 1970s, Monza came close to gaining promotion to the Serie A on multiple occasions. The first time was as a newly promoted team in the 1976–77 season, when they lost the season's final match 2–1 against Modena through an 81st-minute own goal. The following season went in a similar fashion for Monza, losing out to direct promotion in the second-to-last matchday against Pistoiese. In the 1978–79 Serie B season Monza again missed out on promotion in the final matches, being defeated by already-relegated Lecce in the second-to-last match. Monza tied with Pescara on points for third place and the two sides played a promotion tie-breaker, which Monza lost 2–0. In Cappelletti's last season as president, in 1979–80, Monza failed to gain promotion to the top flight for the fourth consecutive year. Four games from the end of the season, Monza were in third place in a spot for direct promotion; decisive defeats against Cesena and Brescia meant that Monza finished in fifth place, three points from Serie A promotion.
Valentino Giambelli presidency (1980–1999).
Valentino Giambelli became the club president in 1980, succeeding Cappelletti, and the club was renamed Calcio Monza. In the 1980–81 Serie B, Monza played in a championship with historical sides Milan and Lazio; both of whom had been relegated from the Serie A following the 1980 Totonero scandal. Monza finished in last place and were relegated to the Serie C1 (third level), but were promoted back one season later. They remained in the Serie B for a further four seasons before being relegated in 1986.
In the 1986–87 Serie C1, players such as Alessandro Costacurta, Francesco Antonioli and Pierluigi Casiraghi, who later became established names in Italian football, made their professional debuts with Monza. Captained by Pierluigi Frosio, Monza gained promotion to the Serie B in the 1987–88 season, and also won their third Coppa Italia Serie C, beating Palermo 2–1 at home following a goalless draw away. The second leg, which was played on 11 June 1988, was Monza's last game in the Stadio Gino Alfonso Sada, after which the team moved to the newly constructed Stadio Brianteo. The first match was played at the new stadium on 28 August 1988, when over 10,000 spectators attended Monza's Coppa Italia game against Serie A club Roma; against expectations, Monza won 2–1 with goals by Casiraghi and Carmelo Mancuso.
After having closely avoided relegation in 1988–89 on goal difference, Monza lost the 1989–90 Serie B relegation play-off against Messina on 7 June 1990, and were relegated to the Serie C1. On 13 June 1991, Monza won a record fourth Coppa Italia Serie C, beating Palermo in the final. They gained promotion to the Serie B in the 1991–92 season but two years later, Monza finished the 1993–94 season in last place and returned to the third tier.
In March 1997, Giambelli signed a collaboration agreement with Milan and Monza became a satellite team of the , the first of its kind in Italy. In June 1997, Monza returned to the Serie B after defeating Carpi 3–2 in the promotion play-off final; they were coached by Luigi Radice, who had also helped them to promotion 30 years prior. The following season, newly promoted Monza changed most of their roster, introducing young players, many of whom came from Milan's youth sector. The team closed the season having been on the verge of relegation.
Financial instability (1999–2018).
In April 1999, after 19 years of presidency, Giambelli left the club amid criticism from fans concerning Monza's close connection with Milan and their CEO Adriano Galliani. With Giambelli's departure, Monza ceased to be Milan's satellite team. The club entered a period of instability, changing owners twice in five years. Monza were relegated to the Serie C1 in 2001 and then, for the first time, to the Serie C2 (fourth level) in 2002. Amid Monza's financial troubles, on 31 December 2003 the of Monza cut the supply of water and gas of Stadio Brianteo after the club was unable to pay the bills; Monza was forced to play home games at Stadio Breda in neighbouring Sesto San Giovanni.
On 18 March 2004, Monza was declared bankrupt. On 3 June the same year, the club was acquired by Atalanta vice-president Gian Battista Begnini, who renamed it AC Monza Brianza 1912. Monza took part in the 2004–05 Serie C2; despite being eliminated in the promotion play-off semi-finals, they were admitted into the Serie C1 via repechage. Monza twice came close to promotion to the Serie B, losing two consecutive play-off finals. In the 2005–06 season, after having lost at home 2–0, Monza won the away leg to Genoa 1–0, having missed many chances to score further goals. The 2006–07 season was even more dramatic: in the first leg at home, Monza beat Pisa thanks to a 74th-minute penalty. In the second leg, a first-half goal by Pisa forced the game into extra time, and Pisa scored again to secure promotion at Monza's expense.
On 13 July 2009, Begnini sold the club to the PaSport holding company, headed by former Milan player Clarence Seedorf. The new ownership did not last long: in 2012 the club was relegated to the Serie C2 and, on 12 May 2013, was sold to Anthony Armstrong Emery. Following broken promises regarding an increase in finances in the club, Monza was sold again, on 12 December 2014, to Dennis Bingham for €1. The new president was contested straight away by fans for not paying the players' salaries.
Following the club's sale to Piero Montaquila in March 2015, Monza won the 2014–15 Lega Pro relegation play-offs against Pordenone, and were due to remain in the third level the following season. However, Monza were declared bankrupt on 27 May. The club was acquired by Nicola Colombo on 2 July that year and was renamed SSD Monza 1912. Monza registered to the Serie D (fourth level) on 31 July and finished the 2015–16 season mid-table. In May 2016, the club changed its name to SS Monza 1912 and achieved promotion back to the Serie C under coach Marco Zaffaroni in 2017. Having won Group B of the Serie D, the team took part in the competition's "poule scudetto" (a post-season competition to determine the best non-professional Italian team); they won the Scudetto Serie D trophy after defeating Ravenna 2–1 in the final.
Berlusconi presidency and Serie A promotion (2018–present).
On 28 September 2018, the holding company Fininvest, which was headed by former Milan president Silvio Berlusconi, announced its acquisition of Monza; Monza-born Adriano Galliani, formerly CEO of Milan, also became part of the board of directors. The Berlusconi–Galliani duo had been one of the most successful leaderships in football history, having won 29 trophies with Milan between 1986 and 2016. According to "Forbes"'s 2021 ranking, Berlusconi was the richest owner of a football club in Italy, and ninth worldwide, with his fortune being valued at $7.6 billion.
In the first season under the new leadership, Monza finished the 2018–19 Serie C in fifth place with Cristian Brocchi as coach, and lost to Viterbese in the final minute of the Coppa Italia Serie C final. On 1 July 2019, the club returned to its historical name AC Monza. Aiming for direct promotion to the Serie B, Monza reinforced their squad with players with Serie A experience to prepare for the 2019–20 season. In March 2020, Monza held first position with a 16 point-lead over second-placed Carrarese. The same month, the Lega Pro committee announced the suspension of the league due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 8 June, the Italian Football Federation formally declared Monza champions and the team were promoted to the Serie B after a 19-year absence from the competition.
Monza headed into the 2020–21 Serie B as the club most likely to finish in first place, according to most bookmakers. Having finished the first half of the season in second place, in a spot for direct promotion, Monza dropped one position at the end of the season and took part in the promotion play-offs; they lost to Cittadella 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals. Brocchi was dismissed at the end of the season, and was replaced by Giovanni Stroppa as head coach.
In the 2021–22 season, Monza lost to Perugia and missed out on direct Serie A promotion in the last matchday. Having finished in fourth place, Monza played the play-off semi-finals where they defeated Brescia and reached the final against Pisa. Monza won the first leg at home 2–1, while Pisa won the second leg 3–2. Two goals in extra time by Monza won them the encounter 4–3 (6–4 on aggregate), to earn promotion to the 2022–23 Serie A for the first time. Prior to their promotion, Monza had competed in 40 Serie B seasons, the most of any Italian club without ever being promoted to the first division. Christian Gytkjær was key to helping Monza to promotion, scoring five goals in the playoffs.
Monza began their Serie A season on 13 August 2022, with a 2–1 home defeat to Torino; Dany Mota's goal in stoppage time was Monza's first in the Italian top flight. After consecutive defeats in the opening five games, Monza earned their first point in a 1–1 draw to Lecce on 11 September. Sitting in last place with only one point in six games, Monza replaced Stroppa with under-19s head coach Raffaele Palladino. He guided them to their first historic win on 18 September, in an upset 1–0 win against giants Juventus at home thanks to a goal by Gytkjær. In their first top-flight season, Monza mathematically avoided relegation six matchdays in advance; no other team had done so on their Serie A debut. Monza eventually finished the season in 11th place with 52 points under Palladino, the highest point tally among newly promoted teams in Europe's top five leagues, and the second-highest point tally for a Serie A debuttee in history.
Colours and identity.
Colours.
Upon their formation in September 1912, Monza's team wore long-sleeved, blue shirts with a white collar and cuffs. The choice of blue was "forced"; a local cloth dealer, who was a football fan, gave the newly founded club a piece of blue cloth he had not been able to sell for years. Following World War I, in the 1919–20 Promozione, the countless washes faded the shirts' colours from blue to white, and they were replaced with new, half-white and half-blue shirts with matching sleeves.
The club continued to wear the blue-and-white colours for 20 years until September 1932, when Monza changed their colours to red and white, which they have worn ever since. The change came as a result of professor Giuseppe Riva's report addressed to the of Monza in May 1923, in which he discovered that the city's historical colours were red and white. Monza debuted with their new colours in the (Two-decades cup), a friendly tournament to mark Monza's 20-year anniversary. The kit was a white shirt with a red vertical stripe in the middle and black shorts. The team's away kit was the inverse of the home one; on occasions when Monza were to face a team also wearing red and white, they wore a blue kit. Ever since, the home kit has been red and the away kit white; prior to 1971, the home shirt was generally solid red and the away shirt white. In the 1937–38 and 1961–62 seasons, Monza's home shirt was striped red-and-white.
During the 1950s, the shorts were usually white and rarely black. Goalkeepers wore black or grey kits. In 1971, Monza's home kit underwent a slight but significant change: a vertical white band was added on the left-hand side, running through the length of the red shirt. The band was red for the white away shirt. The following year, the vertical band extended to the shorts and the kit numbers were displayed on the sleeves. The (Iron Crown) was used as a logo at the top of the stripe on the chest. In the seasons following Monza's Coppa Italia Serie C wins in 1974, 1975, 1988 and 1991, the cockade of Italy replaced the crown. On 22 August 1979, during a 1979–80 Coppa Italia game against Milan, Monza displayed the players' names on top of the numbers on the back, a novelty at the time dubbed "" (American style); the Italian Football Federation did not approve of the change and fined the club. Monza first displayed a sponsor on their shirt in 1982, showing the text "Ponteggi Dalmine".
From 1981, the lateral white stripe was removed from the kit, making way for different forms of full-red shirts; the stripe returned sporadically for short periods in 1992, 2000, 2014 and since 2018. In 2019, following the club's name change back to AC Monza, new Lotto shirts that included a small logo on the back of the collar in reference to the Monza Circuit were unveiled. On their 110th anniversary on 1 September 2022, Monza introduced a light blue kit as their third colours for the 2022–23 season in honour of the club's first shirt.
Monza's first kit in 1912 was blue and white. 
In 1920 the kit changed to blue-and-white halves. 
The first red-and-white kit appeared in 1932. 
In 1937–38 and 1961–62, Monza wore stripes. 
Variations of a full red shirt were worn between the 1930s and 2010s...
...which alternated with the white striped kit, first introduced in 1971.
Badge.
Monza's first crest was designed in 1920: it depicted a blue shield with a red border, with a golden inside. The text "AC Monza" was written in black inside a white horizontal band on top of the shield. The crest remained in use until 1932, when Monza's colours changed to red and white. In 1933, the badge became circular and was vertically divided into red and white halves, and included golden initials ACM with the crown at the bottom. During the 1937–38 season, the badge's shape was changed from a circle to an oval, keeping the same details. It stayed the same until 1945, following World War II, when it changed to a rectangular shape that was divided into red and white halves. The white half on the left featured the club's name and the founding year, while the crown was placed in the red half.
Following Monza's promotion to the Serie B in 1951, the crest again became oval shaped and the text's orientation was changed from vertical to horizontal. This design lasted five years until Monza's merger with Simmenthal, when the logo became more detailed; the badge was shaped like an ox head, including the horns. The colours were placed diagonally, similarly to the 1951 crest, with the letters S (for Simmenthal) and M (Monza) being placed on top of each other in the badge's centre. The crown was placed above the letters. After the end of the merger in 1966, the badge became a stylised golden with red details. The epigraph of the club's name was placed in the inner circle. In 1984, Monza's logo went back to a rectangular shape. A white inverted chevron was placed inside, with the words "Calcio" and "Monza" placed on each side of the chevron. A vertical sword, a reference to Estorre Visconti, was placed inside the downwards-pointing triangle formed by the chevron. The crown formed the hilt of the sword.
In 2000, the logo changed to a rounded-bottom shield; a red crown was placed in the top third on a white background, while the bottom two-thirds contained the words "Calcio Monza 1912" written in white on a red background. The logo remained until 2004, when a new crest was introduced: it was a more rounded red shield with white details; "AC Monza Brianza" was written on top, and a depiction of a sword "cutting through" a crown – both drawn in a minimalist style – was placed on the bottom. Monza celebrated their 100th anniversary in the 2012–13 season. A modified version of the logo was announced to mark the occasion: a gold crown with red and white gems was placed on top of the crest. "MB" (standing for Monza Brianza) written in red was placed below the crest, surrounded by "2012" to the left, "1912" to the right and "100" on the bottom, all written in gold.
Starting from the 2013–14 season, Monza's logo included a red shield with the club's name ("AC Monza Brianza") in white capital letters inside. The was placed above the shield and two white "Visconti" crossed swords were included inside the shield. The logo underwent a minor redesign in 2015, when the two crossed swords were replaced with a vertical sword, and the text on top changed to "SSD Monza", to reflect the club's name change. In 2016 and 2019, the text in the badge was changed to "Monza" and "AC Monza", respectively. In 2021, a thin red outline was added to the logo, enclosing the already present white border surrounding the red shield. The same year, Monza published a brand manual, including information about the geometrical construction of the badge, the fonts used by the club, and their colour dubbed "" (Monza Red; hex: #E4032E).
Anthem.
Since 2006, the club's official anthem has been the song "Monza Alè", which was written and composed by the band Amusia, whose leader was former Monza player Michele Magrin.
Stadiums.
First grounds.
Pro Monza and Pro Italia, the clubs that merged to form Monza in 1912, played in the Boschetti Reali in front of the Royal Villa of Monza. After the merger, Monza first played in the district of Triante; the field was called "" (outside the door) because it was located outside the city of Monza. Small stands were built for a cost of ITL3,000 (€12,000 as of 2022). The opening match at the field was played between Milan and Chiasso on 13 May 1912, which ended in a 5–2 win for Milan.
Monza's first city-based stadium was the Grazie Vecchie, which was inaugurated on 13 May 1915 with a 1–0 win over Juventus Italia. The stadium also played host to a friendly match between Monza and the Czechoslovakia military national team in 1919, which ended in a 1–1 draw.
In late 1923, Monza relocated to their newly constructed stadium in (Ghilini Street), which cost almost ITL70,000 (€67,000). The stadium was inaugurated in early 1924 with a friendly against Gloria from the city of Fiume, following the city's recent annexation to Italy, which Monza won 2–1. The field continued operating until 1939 when World War II made it impractical.
Stadio Gino Alfonso Sada.
In 1945, following the war, a new playing field was built on the parade ground of the former (GIL), and was called the San Gregorio field. It was inaugurated on 21 October with Monza's 2–0 friendly win over Pavia. Following Monza's promotion to the Serie B in 1951, a grandstand and stands were built, and the stadium was renamed Stadio Città di Monza; the supporters, however, continued using its traditional name.
In 1965, the stadium was renamed Stadio Gino Alfonso Sada in honour of the deceased former president of Monza. The club's last match at the "Sada" was played on 11 June 1988; it was the away match of the 1987–88 Coppa Italia Serie C final against Palermo, which Monza won 2–1.
Stadio Brianteo.
On 28 May 1979, plans for the construction of a new stadium, which were approved by the Extraordinary Commissioner Alfio Licandro, began. Construction of the new Stadio Brianteo began on 13 November 1982 and ended in 1986. In the initial project, the stadium's capacity was expected to be around 30,000; for security reasons, however, the capacity was lowered to just under 20,000. Monza played their first game at the "Brianteo" on 28 August 1988, when they hosted Serie A side Roma in the Coppa Italia; Monza won their first match in their new stadium 2–1.
On 4 September 2020, the stadium was renamed U-Power Stadium, following a sponsorship deal with footwear and workwear company U-Power. Monza re-opened the east stand – which had been closed for 20 years – ahead of the 2022–23 Serie A season, bringing the maximum seating capacity from 10,000 to about 16,000.
Monza inaugurated their training ground, , on 3 November 1986. It was renamed "" on 8 October 2022, in honour of owner Silvio Berlusconi and honorary president Paolo Berlusconi's late father.
Supporters.
The first signs of organised support emerged in the early-1970s with the founding of the ultras groups Commandos in 1971 and Club Ultras Monza in 1972. Eagles Monza emerged in the early 1980s. After Monza's move to the new Stadio Brianteo in 1988, several ultras groups began to fold; Eagles was abandoned in 1992. In 1993, Gioventù Brianzola was formed, and became the driving force of the ; the group adopted the eagle as their symbol as a tribute to the defunct group. In 1994, Sempre Al Bar (S.A.B.) was formed. With the dissolution of other groups in 2001, S.A.B. became the main group of the .
Following Berlusconi's takeover of the club in 2018, attendance figures started to rise and new supporter groups began to emerge. On 31 March 2022, Monza formed the AC Monza Club, a project that is aimed at uniting official Monza fan clubs by organising meetings, rallies and sporting events.
The of the Brianteo is also called "" in memory of a young fan who died in 1998. The press stand – part of the west stand – was named in memory of Claudio Parma, a journalist and fan who died in 2008, while the entire west stand bears the name of the historic fan Angelo Scotti, who died in 2018.
Rivalries.
Monza's main rivalry is with fellow Lombardy club Como; it has been defined as the "hottest derby in Serie B". The two clubs first played each other in Como on 19 November 1922, with the match ending in a goalless draw. The rivalry began on 4 June 1967, when Monza beat Como 1–0 in the decisive promotion play-off match of the Serie B. It became more intense on 13 April 1980; with Monza leading 3–1, Como equalised in the last minute with a penalty. The 3–3 draw ended Monza's chances of promotion to the Serie A.
Another important rivalry is the one with Pro Sesto, which is based in the adjacent city Sesto San Giovanni. Historically, the two sides have had a tradition of beating the other away from home. Monza also have a more recent rivalry with Pisa; in 2007, the two sides played in the Serie C promotion play-off final. Pisa won in extra time, and opposing supporters began attacking each other. In 2022, the two sides met once again in a decisive promotion play-off final, this time for the Serie A: Monza won in extra time, and reached the first division for the first time in their history.
In the media.
During the 1955–56 Serie B, Monza's first season after their merger with Simmenthal, Monza's San Gregorio stadium hosted the first free-to-air televised football match in Italy. The match was broadcast by RAI and commentated upon by Nicolò Carosio, and was played on 8 October 1955 between Monza and Verona. The match ended in a goalless draw. Monza earned ITL700,000 (€11,000) from the broadcast. Only 1,500 spectators attended the game because most fans were watching it on television in local bars.
Italian actor Renato Pozzetto, in the 1979 film "The Finzi Detective Agency", played a private investigator Riccardo Finzi, a supporter of Monza who said: " (I support Monza, we will never be able to reach the Serie A). The line became a part of local culture and was used in a fan chant: " (Our Calcio Monza is in the [Serie] C1, and we will never go to the Serie A. But I will not give up, this is my mentality. You too follow the team of your city).
Esports.
In September 2019, Monza launched their esports team to compete in "FIFA" games. They reached the 2021 FIFA eClub World Cup Europe semi-finals and were ranked 12th in the overall rankings. In January 2022, Monza were awarded the "OIES Badge" by the Osservatorio Italiano Esports.

Novara FC

Italian football club
Football club
Novara Football Club, commonly referred to as Novara, is an Italian football club based in Novara, Piedmont.
The club was founded in 2021 by the City of Novara to replace old Novara Calcio that lost its professional status.
History.
In December 1908 the "F.A.S. (Football Association Studenti)" was created by eight students of "Liceo Carlo Alberto", aged between 15 and 16 years; among them an engineer, Gianni Canestrini, and a lawyer, Piero Zorini. In Novara in those days, there were other small clubs like "Voluntas", "Pro Scalon", "Ginnastica e Scherma", "Forza &amp; Speranza", "Collegio Gallarini" and many other student bodies. The best players from these teams came together to form "Novara Calcio", and made their debut in the Italian league on 3 November 1912.
The first match was played against a team already then established as Torino, who won 2–1.
In the years between World War I and World War II, Novara challenged with Pro Vercelli, Alessandria and Casale to make the so-called ""quadrilatero piemontese" (Piedmont Quadrilateral)". Novara played a Coppa Italia final against Inter Milan in 1939. Novara's highest finish came in 1952 when they finished in eighth place in Serie A.
During these years of staying in the top flight, Novara had Silvio Piola to thank. His many goals (which at the end of his career was over 300), made a huge contribution to the cause of Novara. Following his death in 1996, the stadium at which Novara play was dedicated in his name.
In 1956 came relegation to Serie B, and another five years afterwards, they slipped down to Serie C due to a fraudulent complaint by a Sambenedettese player.
A few successful seasons in Serie B followed, but then Novara stumbled again in 1977 with relegation to Serie C and worse in 1981 to Serie C2. In the 1995–96 season, Novara were back in Serie C1, but this joy was short-lived as the following year, the "biancoazzurri" again had to deal with relegation.
Years were spent in the shadows of Italian football until more recently when the league was won in the 2002–03 season.
From Serie C1 to Serie A.
Consolidation in Serie C1 followed, later becoming Lega Pro Prima Divisione, until the
historic promotion of the 2009–10 season where the club returned to Serie B after 33 years.
On 12 June 2011, Novara remarkably secured its promotion to Serie A after a 55-year absence from the league, by defeating Padova in the play-off final. Both consecutive promotions were achieved under the tenure of head coach Attilio Tesser, who was confirmed as Novara boss also for the following 2011–12 top flight campaign.
On 20 September 2011, the first home game in Serie A for 55 years, Novara recorded an historic 3–1 victory over Inter.
This remarkable feat, however, was not representative of their season as Novara managed to win only one more game until the end of January, when it won again against Inter in San Siro. The manager Attilio Tesser was replaced by veteran coach Emiliano Mondonico and re-hired one month later in a desperate and ultimately vain attempt by the owners to save the club from relegation. The club was immediately relegated again to Serie B after one season.
Novara finished 5th in 2012–13 season but were eliminated by Empoli in the promotion play-offs. The following season was terrible for Novara as the club finished 19th in Serie B and lost in a play-out against Varese, losing 4–2 on aggregate. Thus, Novara were relegated to Lega Pro. Novara were crowned as champions of Group A of Lega Pro in 2014–15 and immediately returned to Serie B. In their first season back in Serie B they finished in a playoff spot but they lost to eventual winners Pescara in the semifinal. The following season saw them finish outside the playoffs in 9th, 4 points from a playoff spot. The following season saw Novara get relegated back to Lega Pro following a 20th-place finish in the 2017–18 Serie B.
During the summer of 2021, Novara lost its professional status and a phoenix club was founded in Serie D according to article 52 of FIGC's regulations "NOIF". They were promoted back to Serie C in May 2022, after finishing top of their group in Serie D.

Aurora Pro Patria 1919

Italian football club
Football club
Aurora Pro Patria 1919, commonly referred to as Pro Patria, is an Italian football club based in Busto Arsizio, Lombardy. It currently plays in Serie C, group A.
In Latin, Pro Patria translates to "For the Fatherland".
History.
Pro Patria et Libertate.
The club was founded in 1919.
The club has played in Serie A fourteen times mostly during the first half of the 20th century, the last time being in 1955–56.
In 1995 the club, then officially named "Pro Patria et Libertate", was disqualified from Serie D.
Pro Patria Gallaratese G.B..
The Gallaratese of Gallarate was admitted to Serie C2, in order to keep the historical brand alive, it changed its name to "Pro Patria Gallaratese G.B." (G.B. being for Gallarate and Busto Arsizio, respectively): the club is considered the direct heir of "Pro Patria et Libertate".
The club played in the fourth tier until 2002, when the club won promotion to Serie C1 via the playoffs. In 2008 the club was relegated to Serie C2 after losing in the playoffs to Hellas Verona by 2–1 on aggregate, but was later readmitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione to fill a vacancy.
In June 2008, a club takeover was completed and ambitious plans for a return to Serie B were unveiled. However, impressive performances in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione 2008–09 were accompanied by financial troubles, which led to the club being declared insolvent by the local magistrate in April 2009 due to excessive financial debts. The club's president was later arrested and has to stand trial on charges related to the bankruptcy. The drive to Serie B came to nothing for the team in a most bitter way; badly losing the home return match of their playoff final against Padova, who played with 10 men after an early sending off.
Aurora Pro Patria 1919.
On 27 June 2009 Aurora Pro Patria 1919, owned by the Tesoro family, construction businessmen from Apulia, acquired the sports title from the liquidator of the old company.
In the season 2009–10 it was relegated to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. In the 2012–13 season it was promoted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione. In the 2014–15 season it was relegated to Serie D, but it was readmitted to Lega Pro to fill vacancies. However, a second consecutive relegation to Serie D brought the club down to the amateur levels of Italian football.
Pro Patria is one of the most important football club in the Varese area but due to the recent performances on the pitch, the team has never been able to reach the same level of fame as before.
2013 racism incident.
On 3 January 2013, the club was hosting AC Milan in a friendly match, when a small group of people in the crowd aimed abusive chants at black AC Milan players, including M'Baye Niang, Urby Emanuelson, Sulley Muntari and Kevin-Prince Boateng. Boateng reacted angrily, kicking the ball into the stands, before the entire Milan team walked off the field in protest, causing the game to be abandoned. The final verdict on the incident, however, stated that the punishment handed down was not in reference to racism allegations. Pro Patria was subsequently forced to play one game behind closed doors because of this incident.

Spezia Calcio

Association football club in La Spezia, Italy
Football club
Spezia Calcio is an Italian professional football club based in La Spezia, Liguria, currently competing in the Serie B. Spezia Calcio was founded in 1906 by the Swiss banker Hermann Hurni (or Hurny in some documents), who played for the early Crystal Palace amateur teams in London during his time there as a student.
The first Spezia playing kit, light blue and white, was a second-hand amateur Crystal Palace kit donated to Hurny when he returned to La Spezia. In 1911, following the decision of Alberto Picco and others to honour Pro Vercelli as an example of a small team able to beat the big teams, a plain white shirt was adopted with black shorts and black socks, which is still in use today. In the 1920s prior to the creation of Serie A, Spezia played several top league games against the giants of Italian football, including Inter, Juventus and Milan. The club has participated in all tiers of the Italian football system.
Spezia won the 1944 Campionato Alta Italia which was officially recognized by FIGC (the Italian Football Federation) in 2002 after a long dispute and the use of a special permanent badge was authorized. The tricolour badge is exhibited on the official jerseys during games and has a different shape and size compared to the ordinary Scudetto.
Following its fall from Serie B in 1951, Spezia was destined to languish in the third and fourth division for 55 years. The 2000s saw a return to Serie B in 2006, bankruptcy and then rebirth, the club re-establishing itself as a regular Serie B team once again. In 2020, exactly 100 years from its first appearance at the top level, Spezia finally returned to Serie A as the winner of the promotion play-offs, securing a second Serie A term for the 2021–22 season.
History.
Early history (1906–1944).
Spezia Calcio was founded in 1906 by the Swiss banker Hermann Hurny (or Hurni in some documents), who played for the reserves of Crystal Palace in London during his time there as a student. Allegedly the first Spezia kit, light blue and white, was a second hand Crystal Palace kit donated to Hurny when he returned to La Spezia. He played for Crystal Palace again (in its revived form) in 1909.
In 1926, they won the Seconda Divisione and were promoted to the Prima Divisione, which was at that time the second-highest level of Italian football. In 1929 Spezia won the Prima Divisione but the league was demoted to become the third division in Italy so the team remained at the second level, playing in Serie B.
For the 1929–30 season, the club played in the first season of the newly formed Serie B and changed their name to AC Spezia. Spezia remained at this level before suffering relegation in 1935, only to swiftly return for the 1936–37 season.
In 1944, because of World War II, the Italian football federation decided to split the top league into regional rounds. The team, named "42° Corpo dei Vigili del Fuoco della Spezia" (Firefighters of La Spezia) after a merger with the local firefighter to have a sufficient number of players, was included in Round D of Emilia-Romagna, together with Corradini Suzzara, Fidentina, Orlandi Busseto and Parma. Spezia won the round and qualified to the semi-finals, in which it challenged Suzzara, Carpi and Modena. Spezia won also this round, winning five of the six matches played, losing only to Carpi. By winning the semi-final round, Spezia was admitted to play a two-legs play-off against Bologna.
The first match, played in Bologna, was suspended because of incidents after the 1–0 goal of Spezia by the Bologna supporters; Spezia was awarded a 2–0 win because of that. The return match, scheduled to be played in La Spezia, was first moved to Carpi, because of the heavy bombings in the Ligurian city during the period, then cancelled because of protests by Bologna chairman Renato Dall'Ara, so Spezia was admitted to the final without playing the return match.
The finals, held in Milan, were played against Venezia and Torino. On 9 July 1944, the first match between Spezia and Venezia was played: it ended in a 1–1 draw. commented by the "Gazzetta dello Sport" as a "surprising result".
On 16 July, Spezia challenged the "Grande Torino", with Vittorio Pozzo as coach and Silvio Piola as striker. The match ended in an epic 2–1 victory for Spezia. After the third match, in which Torino beat Venezia in a 5–2 win, Spezia was declared champion.
The title was officially recognised by FIGC in 2002 as decoration.
Following the decision of FIGC in 2002, Spezia is authorized by the Italian Federation to exhibit a tricolour badge on the official jerseys which is unique, being the only example of a permanent one in Italy.
The badge has a different shape and size compared to the ordinary Scudetto.
Post-war era to bankruptcy (1944–2008).
After the war, the Italian football system once again consisted of national leagues, as opposed to regional rounds, and Spezia returned to Serie B from 1946 to 1951. Relegation in the 1950–51 season led to a rapid fall through the divisions, as the club was relegated in three consecutive seasons back into the local Promozione Ligure in 1953. The club's name was changed to A.C. Spezia-Arsenal in 1954, only to change again to Football Club Spezia 1906 just a year later.
Promotion back to Serie C in 1958 marked the beginning of a period in which the club bounced back and forth between the third and fourth levels of Italian football, a cycle that would continue until finally returning to Serie B in the 2000s. The most consistent spell in a single division was Spezia's run in Serie C from 1966 to 1979, when the club finished in 17th position and was again relegated to the fourth-division Serie C2. Spezia returned the next year with another promotion but again fell back down in 1981. Another spell in Serie C was to follow from 1986 to 1997, when the club returned to the fourth tier once more. The name of the club was changed to its current name Spezia Calcio in 1995.
In 2002, the club reached an agreement with Internazionale, making the club Inter's feeder club, with the Milan club holding a percentage in Spezia ownership shares. The team signed Goran Pandev, Aco Stojkov, and Alex Cordaz in the first season. In the second season, Cristian Lizzori, Luca Ceccarelli and Nicola Napolitano were signed. In 2004–05 season, Spezia received Antonio Rizzo from Fiorentina and Paolo Castelli from Internazionale.
Players like Alex Cordaz, Riccardo Meggiorini and Paolo Hernán Dellafiore joined the team directly from Inter to boost the team in January 2005. The season ended with winning Coppa Italia Serie C against Frosinone. After the season, Inter sold most of its shares in Spezia.
The next season (2005–06) started with the arrival of a new owner, Giuseppe Ruggieri, and a new manager, Antonio Soda. After a long battle for the first position with rivals Genoa, Spezia were crowned Serie C1 champion and promoted to Serie B after 55 years of absence. The squad included Vito Grieco, Massimiliano Guidetti, Giuseppe Alessi, Massimiliano Varricchio and Roberto Maltagliati.
Life in Serie B with traditional Italian powerhouses Juventus, Genoa and Napoli was difficult for the newly promoted Ligurian side, which themselves were fighting to avoid the relegation spots in the 2006–07 campaign. With a squad consisting of mid-season signing Guilherme do Prado, Tomás Guzmán, Corrado Colombo, Massimiliano Guidetti, Nicola Santoni, amongst others, Spezia managed to survive in Serie B through finishing in 19th place, gaining participation in the playout round after a late victory in Turin against Juventus. Having tied 2–2 with Juventus, the Ligurians were only seconds away from relegation, but a dramatic goal on the 91st minute by Nicola Padoin condemned Arezzo to the drop to Serie C and qualified Spezia for the playoffs. The first leg against Hellas Verona, who had ended the regular season in 18th position, ended in a 2–1 win for Spezia, and a 0–0 tie in the return match secured Spezia's place in Serie B for the following season.
However, in the next season, with the team led by players such as Isah Eliakwu, Colombo and Do Prado, the club failed to make the miracle happen in consecutive seasons, primarily due to a troubling situation in the financiers of the club and growing economic issues. Spezia finished the 2007/08 season in 21st place, only above Cesena and three points behind Avellino in the final safety position, relegated after two seasons back in Serie B.
In 2008, due to financial difficulty and following their relegation from Serie B, the club was forced to declare bankruptcy. In June 2011 FIGC sanctioned a number of former board members of the bankrupted Spezia for sports fraud.
Refoundation and Serie A (2008–present).
The team was refounded in 2008 as A.S.D. Spezia Calcio 2008 by Gabriele Volpi, the owner of water polo team of Pro Recco and Croatian side HNK Rijeka, winner of numerous scudetti and admitted to the non-professional Serie D, thanks to "Article 52 NOIF of FIGC".
Upon promotion in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione at the end of the Serie D 2008–09 season, A.S.D. Spezia changed its denomination in the current "Spezia Calcio", a return to the club name from 1995. Spezia finished Girone A of Lega Pro Seconda Divisione as second and qualified for promotion play-offs in 2009–10 season. Spezia defeated Pavia at semifinal and Legnano at final and were promoted to Girone A of Lega Pro Prima Divisione after making a second consecutive promotion.
During the 2011–12 season, the club secured a Lega Pro treble for the first time; finishing as champions of Lega Pro Prima Divisione/B and being promoted to Serie B, winning the Coppa Italia Lega Pro, and also winning the Supercoppa di Lega di Prima Divisione. A 3–0 victory against Latina on 6 May 2012 secured promotion, Spezia's third in four seasons as part of a rise from the fifth to the second level of the national football system.
After returning to Serie B, the club enjoyed relative success, generally finishing in mid-table or qualifying for the promotion playoffs from 2012 to 2019. In this time, Spezia qualified for the playoffs on five occasions, only to be eliminated in the first round four times and was defeated in the semifinals by Trapani in the 2015–16 season. This period established the club as a consistent contender for promotion to Serie A. A big international investment was made by Australian businessman Lucas Vivarelli during this time, when he bought the team's home kit, enabling the club to grow further with such significant funding.
In the 2019–20 season, Spezia finished in third place, only behind the automatically promoted Benevento and Crotone, equaling their highest ever league finish. This was the sixth occasion in which Spezia had reached the Serie B promotion playoffs in the previous eight years. After beating Chievo in the semi-final of the promotion play-offs, Spezia won promotion to Serie A for the first time on 20 August 2020 by defeating Frosinone in the final via the tiebreaker rule over two legs (with each team having won 1–0 in each leg respectively, but Spezia ending the regular league season five places higher than eighth placed Frosinone). This was Spezia's fourth promotion since Volpi's refoundation in 2008 (the club rising from the-then fifth-tier Serie D to Serie A in just 12 years).
After clinching promotion just over a month prior, Spezia played its first home game of the 2020–21 Serie A season against Sassuolo on 27 September 2020, ending in a 4–1 home defeat, with Andrey Galabinov scoring their first-ever top-flight goal. Spezia won its first Serie A match on 30 September, against Udinese, ending in a 2–0 away win. Volpi, having owned the club for just under 13 years and supporting its rise through the Italian professional divisions, sold the club in February 2021 to an American ownership group headed by the family of Robert Platek, a partner of U.S. private investment firm MSD Capital. Despite having been widely expected to lose its relegation battle at the end of the first season in Serie A, Spezia impressively overcame much larger and wealthier clubs on several occasions throughout the season, including a home win against Milan, a 2–1 away victory over Napoli, followed by further success in the Liguria derby against Sampdoria, whilst also earning draws against Internazionale, Roma and Atalanta. Boosted by the flexible attacking-based tactics of coach Vincenzo Italiano, Spezia's on-field success was most notable in their improved second half of the season, which led to a 15th-place finish with 39 points (six more than Benevento in the final relegation position), with survival eventually being secured through a 4–1 win at home to Torino on 15 May 2021. Another notable feat during the season was the call-up of star midfielder Matteo Ricci to the Italy national team in March 2021, 85 years after club legend Luigi Scarabello played for Italy (the last Italian international to have played for Spezia simultaneously). Alongside Ricci, key players who impressed for the Ligurians upon their survival in the top-flight include striker M'Bala Nzola, scorer of 11 goals in 2020/21, loanee Tommaso Pobega, Emmanuel Gyasi, as well as academy products Giulio Maggiore and Simone Bastoni.
Ahead of Spezia's second season in Serie A, the club lost coach Italiano, who was appointed by Fiorentina. He would be replaced by Thiago Motta. The club was also hit by the news that it had been subjected to a two-year transfer ban by FIFA, active from January 2022, due to a breach of national immigration law through illegally signing 13 underage players from Nigeria, that was later reduced to a one-year partially suspended sentence on appeal.

Colours, stadium and supporters.
Spezia's official club colours are white and black. The home kit traditionally consists of a plain white shirt with black trim, black shorts and black socks. White shorts and socks are also commonly used in the event of kit clashes with opponents. Away kits typically feature either an all-black design for shirts, shorts and socks, or the reverse of the home kit, but may also feature a variety of different colours, often changing each season. The club's nickname is "Gli Aquilotti" ("The Eagles").
The club hosts its matches at the 10,336-capacity Stadio Alberto Picco, which has been the club's home stadium since 1919. For the 2020–21 season, Spezia was forced to play many of its home matches at the Stadio Dino Manuzzi in Cesena, which has a capacity of just under 24,000, because its home stadium did not meet Serie A requirements. However, Spezia was eventually able to return to the Alberto Picco in the latter stage of the season after undergoing renovations.
Spezia's fanbase is almost exclusively based in the city of La Spezia and the surrounding areas, due to the domination of Liguria of its two largest clubs, Genoa and Sampdoria, who are heavily supported throughout the region. With Liguria having become known as a breeding ground for multiple teams since the early days of football in Italy, many derbies have emerged between the football clubs of the region. Spezia maintains minor rivalries with Liguria's more traditional powerhouses, Genoa and Sampdoria, with fierce historical meetings with the former in their battle for promotion in the 2005–06 Serie C season as well as on numerous occasions in Serie B, along with the more recent matches between Spezia and both of these two clubs in Serie A from Spezia's first season in 2020/21. Similarly, the club has played many notable fixtures against Pisa, which has become known as the "Tuscan-Ligurian Derby", as well as a rivalry with Carrarese in the "Derby Lunense". Other rivalries that Spezia has contested throughout its history, particularly in its time in the lower leagues of Italian football, include those with other Ligurian sides such as Virtus Entella, Savona, Sestrese and Sanremese.

Calcio Foggia 1920

Italian football club
Football club
Calcio Foggia 1920, commonly referred to as Foggia, is an Italian football club based in Foggia, Apulia. It currently plays in Serie C, having last been in the top level Serie A in 1995.
It plays in Serie C, the third division of the Italian championship. The team experienced the best periods in its history in the sixties and seventies of the twentieth century, in Serie A, and above all in the first half of the nineties, playing four seasons in the top flight, coming close to qualifying for the UEFA Cup and gaining media exposure in European level for expressing an unprecedented, fast and attacking football.
On 23 April 2017, the club regained promotion to Serie B after a 19-year absence, but folded again only two years later, to restart from Serie D in 2019 as Calcio Foggia.
History.
Foggia Calcio &amp; U.S. Foggia.
Foundation and early years.
The club was founded in 1920 as Foggia Calcio. The club spent its early history playing football in the lower leagues, winning a championship in the "dilettanti" in 1933.
In 1957–58, a merger took place between Foggia Calcio and Foggia Incedit, forming Unione Sportiva Foggia as the club is today. In 1961–62, the team was taken over by President Domenico Rosa Rosa, a wood industrialist, and coach Oronzo Pugliese, who quickly led them to promotion to Serie B.
Reaching Serie A.
History was made in the 1963–64 season, when Rosa Rosa and Oronzo Pugliese's Foggia reached Serie A for the first time. From 1964–65, Foggia managed to compete in three consecutive seasons in the top flight. On 31 January 1965, still under the guidance of coach Pugliese, Foggia recorded a historic 3–2 victory against Inter, who were at the time led by manager Helenio Herrera. The season was crowned by the national call-ups of Micelli and Nocera who played for Italy against Wales. Italy won 4–1 and Nocera managed to get on the scoresheet. At the end of the season, Pugliese left to take charge of Roma.
Pugliese was replaced by Egizio Rubino, and Foggia, although with more difficulty compared to the previous season, managed to survive the drop again. The following year, however, Foggia was relegated. It was a forgettable championship, after 10 matches Foggia had collected only three points and scored just 24 goals. Rubino was sacked and replaced by Bonazzini. The team improved under Bonazzini but failed to avoid relegation. At the end of the season, president Rosa Rosa also left the club, following their relegation.
Relegated at the end of the 1966–67 season, Foggia returned to the top flight in 1970–71, with Tommaso Maestrelli on the bench. Maestrelli would later win the 1973–74 scudetto with Lazio. Luigi Del Neri was, at the time, a Foggia player. The club was relegated again and returned to Serie A in 1973–74, before another relegation which came after a 6-point deduction for alleged corruption relating to the referee of a home match against Milan. The coach that season was Lauro Toneatto. Foggia played two more seasons in Serie A in 1976–77 and in 1977–78, when they were once more relegated to Serie B.
Glory years and "Zemanlandia".
Following their relegation back to Serie B, Foggia were then dealt with a further blow with relegation to Serie C. They battled their way in Serie C1 throughout much of the 1980s. This was a particularly tough time for Foggia as their regional rivals, Bari, Lecce, Barletta and Taranto were all playing at higher levels.
In 1989, with the appointment of Czech coach Zdeněk Zeman, the club began to enter the greatest period in its history. The aggressive and entertaining football of the Bohemian coach was based on a 4–3–3 formation. Pressure, offside tactics and frenetic movement of both players and the ball made up the trademark style of Zeman's Foggia. The club first returned to Serie B, and then the following season in 1990–91, they won the Serie B by a large margin and returned to Serie A.
After returning to Serie A in the 1991–92 season, "Foggia dei Miracoli", as they were known, proved to be competitive with any opponent and was appreciated by the press because of the attractive football they played. The term "Zemanlandia" was then coined to indicate the style created by Zeman, and became strictly associated to the Foggia team of the 1990s. The Foggia team also featured star players, especially attacking trio of Giuseppe Signori, Francesco Baiano and Roberto Rambaudi, as well as Russian star Igor Shalimov. That season, Foggia achieved the amazing feat of scoring 58 goals while also conceding 58. Foggia soon lost many of these quality players, including their three key forwards, and had to replace them with young talent. The club completed three Serie A campaigns finishing mid-table. In Serie A 1993-94, Foggia's football continued but the depleted squad was no longer as competitive and the club was relegated back to Serie B in 1995.
Zeman left to join Lazio at the end of that season, marking the end of "Zemanlandia" whilst the club was beset with financial problems. The Foggia glory days had come to an end.
Decline, Serie C and Zeman's return.
Following the drop, Foggia spent two seasons in Serie B achieving mid-table finishes, before another relegation followed at the end of the 1997–98 season. They did not fare any better down in Serie C1, with another successive relegation to Serie C2.
Playing football in Italy's fourth tier was far less glamorous than the Zemanlandia days but the club set itself on the long road back in 2002–03, when led by coach Pasquale Marino and key players Roberto De Zerbi and Michele Pazienza, they were promoted back to Serie C1.
After the 2003–04 season, in which they finished mid-table but with good signs for the following year, Foggia were hit with financial problems and lost the coach Marino and all the best players.
Second U.S. Foggia.
The news sent the fans into despair but Giuseppe Coccimiglio took over the reins of the club and gave confidence to the new club which assumed the team's historic name, Unione Sportiva Foggia, and was able to keep their place in the league, thanks to Comma 3 of the Article 52 of N.O.I.F.
After two more seasons finishing in mid-table, during which there were five coaching changes, Coccimiglio was criticised for not paying players' wages, a situation which created instability. After complex negotiations, the company passed into the hands of a team of local entrepreneurs led by Tullio Capobianco.
The club spent the following years mid-table in C1, narrowly losing a promotion playoff in 2006–07 against Avellino which would have seen them return to Serie B. The following season, 2007–08, they again reached the playoffs, this time losing to Cremonese.
In June 2010, Pasquale Casillo, chairman and owner during the glory years of the 1990s, re-acquired the club, and reformed the old trio of Foggia heads by appointing back Zdeněk Zeman as manager and Giuseppe Pavone as director of football. However, despite impressive performances from several young and promising players who went on to play at the highest level like Lorenzo Insigne and Marco Sau, Foggia missed out on playoff qualification.
Second Foggia Calcio.
After the end of the 2011–12 season, Foggia was declined to enter Lega Pro Prima Divisione and was thus was excluded from professional football.
In the summer 2012 a new company named A.C.D. Foggia Calcio was founded to continue the football history of the city of Foggia. The club restarted from Serie D thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F. and was immediately promoted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione through a repechage, dropping the "A.C.D." part of their denomination in the process.
Over the next five seasons, the club will make the climb from Serie D (fifth level) to Serie B (second level); all this thanks to the coaches Pasquale Padalino, Roberto De Zerbi (who also won a Serie C Italian cup) and Giovanni Stroppa.
Third Foggia Calcio.
After the end of the 2018–19 season, Foggia was declined to enter Serie C and was thus was excluded from professional football.
In the summer 2019 a new company named Calcio Foggia 1920 was founded to continue the football history of the city of Foggia. The club restarted from Serie D thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F. and was soon promoted to Serie C.
Supporters.
Football has always been a popular sport to follow in the city of Foggia, especially since the Zeman years. I Satanelli can also count on support from across the Province of Foggia.
The only twinning Foggia fans have is with the supporters of Cagliari and more specifically with the "Sconvolts 1987" ultras. However, each group has personal friendships, notable are those with Monza, Latina and Budapest Honvéd.
93 year-old Foggia fan Nonno Ciccio has been attending matches consistently since 1937, with the exception of wartime years. Nonno is now cited as the oldest ultra in Italy and, as of March 2016, still regularly attended Foggia matches, home and away.

Frosinone Calcio

Italian professional football club
Football club
Frosinone Calcio () is a professional Italian football club based in Frosinone, Lazio. The club was founded on 5 March 1906 under the name Unione Sportiva Frusinate, but conventionally the year 1928 is indicated as the beginning of competitive activities of significant importance. Following cancellation by the Italian Football Federation, it was refounded in 1959 and in 1990. In the 2014–15 season the club played in Serie B for the sixth time in its history. The club earned its first promotion to the top flight Serie A in the 2015–16 season, but were relegated back down to Serie B after just one season. In the 2018–19 season it was promoted to Serie A for a second time.
After a long tradition of playing in Serie C, in recent years, following the historic promotion which took place in the 2005–06 season, the club participated in five consecutive seasons in Serie B, becoming, after the two teams in Rome, the third most notable team of the region of Lazio. In the club's history at a national level, Frosinone have won two championships of Serie C2 (1986–87 and 2003–04) and two of Serie D (1965–66 and 1970–71). On 16 May 2015, the "Ciociari", with a 3–1 win over Crotone, secured their first, historic promotion to Serie A.
History.
Foundation and early years.
&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Quote_box/styles.css" /&gt;
"The “Unione Sportiva Frusinate” is established in Frosinone. The association has as its main purpose the diffusion among the younger generations of gymnastic disciplines, fencing, " football " and athletic sports with the aim of physical and intellectual education of Frosinone youth."
Constitutive Act of the "Unione Sportiva Frusinate", article 1 (5 March 1906)
"Frosinone Calcio" was founded on 5 March 1906 under the name "Unione Sportiva Frusinate". The colours of the team were originally red and blue which were later changed to the current yellow and blue. By year of foundation, the Frosinone company ranks third among those still active in the Lazio, after "S.S. Lazio" (1900) and "S.S. Formia" (1905)
On 5 March 1906, the lawyer Leone Vivoli, future mayor of Frosinone, gave birth to the "Unione Sportiva Frusinate". The objectives in the articles of association included the diffusion of various sports and among them there was explicitly included football.
On 14 March 1906 Il Messaggero reported the news as follows: «"Made up of about thirty effective members, it was formed in our city with premises in Corso Vittorio Emanuele n.2 " , " a Frosinone sports club chaired by the lawyer Leone Vivoli. Councilors: student R. Giovannelli - accountant G. Tora - receiver G. Pesci - engineer E. Marzi - Inspector E. Toscano - Secretary Gabriele Antonucci - Sports Director Gerardo Bodin de Chadelard"».
The presence of competitive football-related activities is demonstrated by some documents immediately following the signing of the company statute, including a photo dating back to 1907, taken from the Bottoni archive, which shows a youth team of Frosinone footballers probably aged between 10 and 12 years.
Il Messaggero underlined, in the edition of 1 February 1907, the feedback acquired in a short time by the new sports association in the city: «"This sports union which has as its main purpose physical education, given the ever increasing number of members , has occupied new premises [...] The brilliant meeting is frequented by the most respectable people of the city who praise and encourage the healthy development of the Association"».
The first corporate colours, as specified in the articles of association in article IV, were red and blue, taken from the city coat of arms.
It showed a rampant lion on a red background and a blue cross band with the motto "Bellator Frusino", given by Sillo Italico, when the city refused to surrender to Hannibal's armies. Given the cost of the uniforms of the time, it is unlikely that the rossoblu uniform was worn from the beginning. 
Article III of the Articles of Association stated, with a rather modern approach for the time, that the sports association abstained from any activity of a political and religious nature
The first playing field adopted by the company was located in Frosinone along today's via Cicerone (at the time called via Casilina Nord) near the municipal villa, while the historic "Stadio Matusa" (which would have resisted, with modifications and extensions subsequent, until 2017) was built only in 1932.
The same club, however, has conventionally chosen as its date of origin not the foundation of the sports club (5 March 1906), as is widely consolidated practice with illustrious examples such as the Genoa (1893) and Milan (1899)(sports clubs which included "cricket" and "football") but rather the change of name in ""CXIX Legio M.V.S.N. Frosinone" and his consequent affiliation to the FIGC which took place over twenty years later, on 19 September 1928.
This method appears very unusual if we consider the establishment of many other sports clubs, such as the "Società Podistica Lazio" (which, founded in 1900, joined the FIGC in 1908 and set up a football section only in 1910) or the "Genoa Cricket and Football Club"" (which became affiliated five years after being created as a sports club).
In fact, even before the change of company name induced by the fascist regime, the " U.S. Frusinate " had already obtained affiliation with the FIGC in 1923 and had been involved in competitive activity by appearing in the federal ranks of the championship of the Fourth Division Lazio 1923-1924 in group B. The Ciociaro" team" in that period at an organizational level was coordinated by Augusto Diamanti, a reference figure who was in charge of the company's executives. In the starting lineup, among others: Biagi (goalkeeper), Armando Niro, Nobili, Magni, Luigi Diamanti, Dante and Giulio Toscani, Aldo and Renato Calmanti (the latter would also be captain for many years to come, also playing in the Prima Division until the mid-1930s, when he suddenly died of a heart attack at the age of 29).
The activity of the Frosinone team at the beginning of the 1920s is testified by the sports news of the time, including an article from 1922 published in "La Gazzetta dello Sport". It reports the description of the match played on 28 June 1922, at the "Madonna della Neve" football field in Frosinone, between the "59 º fanteria Frosinone" and the "U.S. Frusinate". The official meeting, directed by the referee Carlo Magni and played in the presence of the mayor Piero Gizzi and the military authorities, was valid for the assignment of the " Comune di Frosinone " award. The victory went to the selection of the Army for six goals to zero.
Experienced players such as Vincenzo Fresia, four-time champion of Italy with Pro Vercelli and former number 9 jersey in the national team were lined up in the latter's row. Who served as a lieutenant in Frosinone in the "59th Infantry Regiment"
In another " match " played on 27 August of the same year, the Frosinone team reached the Rossoneri of the " C.S. Alatri " thanks to a marking by its captain Renato Calmanti.
At that time the presence of category players in the military selection stimulated the competitive activity of the Unione Sportiva Frusinate, which was deployed on the field with the white and blue social colours. After affiliation to the FIGC in 1923 and registration in the IV Lazio Division, in 1925 the "Unione Sportiva Frusinate" passed the baton to the new "Società Sportiva Alba Frusinate".
At the end of the decade sports activity in Frosinone received new impetus from the fascist policies of incentives for physical exercise and sport, as well as the economic and political expansion that the city underwent following the establishment of the new province of which it became the capital in 1927. In this context, on 19 September of the following year, the company changed its name again to " Gruppo Sportivo CXIX Legione M.V.S.N. Frosinone ", thus joining again the Italian Football Federation. On 25 September, the team registered for the third division group B championship.
On 17 October 1929, the sports newspaper " Il Littorale " reported the news of the affiliation of the new " Polisportiva Bellator Frusino " to the FIGC. The sports club, which collected the inheritance from the " CXIX Legione M.V.S.N. Frosinone ", was led by Pier Luigi Tinelli. The team participated in the III Division championship, group C, while the following season was included in group B
The club, later named "Bellator Frusino", managed to reach the National First Division in 1934. The figure of president Emilio Frongasse was crucial in this period. In the later half of the thirties, Bellator Frusinate disbanded, and was replaced by FF.GG. Frosinone which played its football in an interprovincial tournament.
All the championships were suspended during the Second World War and the football club Frusinate disappeared.
The rebirth of Frosinone occurred in the 1945–1946 championship, the team competed in the Seconda Categoria championship and rose to Prima Categoria the following year, and later, following an excellent championship season, managed to gain promotion into Serie C-Lego Centro. From 1948–49 to 1951–52, the Canarini competed in the Promozione-Interregionale della Lega Centro championship, and were included in the new Quarta Serie championship during the summer of 1952.
From 1952 to 1958, for six consecutive years, "the Canarini" competed in the Quarta Serie Championship, with their highest finish being fourth place, which was achieved in 1953. The most significant match this time was against Cosenza on 24 November 1957. Cosenza were playing for promotion but Frosinone took the lead (and duly won) with three minutes remaining.
The referee, struck by a Cosenza player, fell to the ground and was booed until the end of the game. Several episodes of violence then took place and the game was transformed into a "western". After leaving the stadium, the referee was chased for a few kilometres by some Frosinone supporters. Cosenza forwarded an appeal and the CAF overturned the result of the match. Frosinone expressed their resentment against the Lega for the injustice suffered and threatened to withdraw from the league. Following this, Frosinone missed the return fixture in Cosenza and other penalties by the Lega were imposed.
The most important people of this time were the presidents Domenico Ferrante and Angelo Cristofaro (one of the leading figures in the history of the club), a former coach Genta and players Azzoni, Gabriele, Diglio, Dini and Spinato.
1960s–80s.
In 1958, U.S. Frosinone was founded, competing in both the Seconda Categoria and Promozione championships. Football returned to Frosinone in 1963 when president Cristofari together with Dante Spaziani and Augusto Orsini, announced the formation of Sporting Club Frosinone. In Serie D, Frosinone always finished among the top positions, and in 1966 won promotion to Serie C after an encounter with Latina. The following year, the canarini were relegated back to Serie D, where in 1967–68 they came third, then fifth and second. The leading figures at the club during this period were the Stirpe brothers, coaches De Angelis and Rambone and players Benvenuto, Caputi, Da Col, Del Sette, Fumagalli and Trentini.
In 1970–71, Frosinone, under club president Marocco, boasted the national record for the best defence (with goalkeeper Recchia only conceding 8 goals) and again managed promotion to Serie C, where the canarini played out four good seasons (the best finish was seventh in 1972) and their star player Massimo Palanca entered the football firmament, top goalscorer of the central group of Serie C in 1974 and then later was successful representing Catanzaro in Serie A. From 1975 to 1978 the canarini played in Serie D, reaching promotion to Serie C2 in 1976–77. In 1977–78, Frosinone were again relegated back to Serie D and remained there until 1982. The club's key protagonists of the seventies were the presidents Marocco and Battista, coaches Giuseppe Banchetti and Giuseppe Lupi and players Brunello, Colletti, Dal Din, Santarelli, Masiello, Vescovi and, as mentioned earlier, Massimo Palanca. Frosinone started the next decade in the best possible way.
In 1980–81, the Canarini were promoted to Serie C2 without losing a game. Among the professionals, Frosinone managed good placements and produced new talent such as Gabbriellini, Perrotti and De Paola. Despite a precarious financial condition, Frosinone, led by president Di Vito and coach Alberto Mari, were promoted to Serie C1.
In 1987–88 season the Canarini played their first season in Serie C1 and finished mid-table. They returned immediately to Serie C2 the next season however, despite a good start. Goalkeeper Marco Cari and coach Alberto Mari (later replaced by Robotti) were suspended for a football related betting offence. Among the most important players during the 1980s were Davato, Atzori, Di Liso, Cristiano, Bellini, Perrotti and Edoardo Artistico Poli, who then began an enviable football career.
Bankruptcy and return to Serie C.
In the summer of 1990, having missed out on promotion to C1 by just three points, Frosinone was removed from the Italian Football Federation because of their financial state. When it seemed likely that they would return to the Promozione division, the club was placed in the Interregionale, where it remained for four years.
In 1993–94, after the championship was almost completed, the "Canarini" ("the canaries") were overtaken by both Giulianova and Albanova, and were relegated, but they were reinstated to Serie C after the season ended.
In 1996, the club gained a mid-table placing in Serie C2, and was leading in Girone C of C2, but on the last day of the championship Frosinone was defeated by Benevento and was overtaken in the table by Avezzano. They also lost in the play-offs, being beaten in the semi-final by Albanova. They then played out three consecutive mediocre seasons. They survived the first two, in play-offs against Casertana and Albanova, but in the third year Frosinone was defeated by Tricase and relegated.
In Serie D, Frosinone finished fifth in 2000, while in their second year in Serie D the team was involved in an exciting head-to-head battle with A.C. Martina of Apulia. In the end they finished second, but with an impressive 81 points. Under president Navarra and coaches Luca and Stefano Sanderra, the team returned to Serie C2.
In their first two championships back in C2, Frosinone were managed by five different tacticians. After a good start, the team seemed able to reach the play-offs, however finished mid-table. In 2003, the club was taken over by a group of entrepreneurs led by Maurizio Stirpe, son of Benito, a former president of the club back in the sixties.
Stirpe called Enrico Graziani to Frosinone as a general director. Graziani had already worked at Teramo, gaining the Abruzzese club promotion to C1. The managerial position was entrusted to Giorgini, who had spent the previous season with Serie C2 side Brindisi. After an average start to the season, Giorgini was replaced by Daniele Arrigoni, former coach of Messina and Palermo in Serie B.
With an already strong side, including players such as Arno, Vitali, Dario Rossi, Gianluca and Stefano De Angelis, Manca, Tatomir, Galuppi and the goalkeeper de Juliis, being improved in the transfer market, adding quality players such as De Cesare, Aquino and Buonocorre. Much expectation was placed upon Enrico Buonocorre, but the trequartista live up to them. He did however, score a crucial free kick in the match against Castel Di Sangro.
The team performed well in 2003–04 Serie C2 season, fighting for supremacy near the top of the table with Brindisi. The two teams will take turns to occupy first place until the very end of the season. On the final day, Frosinone, with a point less than Brindisi, travelled to Melfi, while Brindisi faced a tough trip away to Sicilian club Igea Virtus. Both Melfi and Igea were in the running for a place in the play-offs, leaving it all to play for in these two clashes. Frosinone beat Melfi thanks to a great goal by Ciro De Cesare, while Brindisi failed to beat Igea.
Frosinone were now back in Serie C1 for the first time in sixteen years. The 2003–04 season is remembered not only for the historic promotion back to C1, but also victories in the derby with Latina, with whom there is a heated rivalry. Frosinone won both matches 1–0, with goal from Manca away and Aquino scoring at home.
Upon their return to C1, which saw them travel to such historic cities as Cremona, Mantua, and Pisa, Frosinone appointed Dino Pagliari as coach, while the likes of Salvatore Mastronunzio, Di Deo (later sold to Ternana in B), Molinari, Nicola Pagani, Mauro Zaccagnini, goalkeeper Zappino, promoted, Alfredo Cariello, Davide D'Antoni, Francesco Mocarelli, Antonio Di Nardo, Michele Ischia were all signed to bolster the playing squad. Famous men who have played for Frosinone include the sport commentator Sandro Ciotti.
The season saw Frosinone go through highs and lows, in the end finishing fifth and reaching the play-offs, where they were eliminated by Mantova.
Serie B.
In the following season, 2005–06, Frosinone were coached by Ivo Iaconi, who had offers from two Serie B teams, Fermana and Pescara, yet opted to manage the Canarini.
Several players were signed to help the club in their push for promotion including Ciro Ginestra, Stefano Bellè, Jimmy Fialdini, Paolo Antonioli, Massimo Perra, Marco Martini, Marco Ogliari and Giuseppe Anaclerio.
Despite the presence of fallen giant and former Scudetto winners Napoli in the league, Frosinone emerged as strong challengers. They began the season well, with a 4–1 victory at Perugia.
Frosinone continued their strong form right throughout the championship, finally finishing second behind Napoli and favourites to win the play-offs. Their first opponents were Tuscan side Sangiovannese, who had finished fifth. Both matches ended scoreless and Frosinone progressed to the final by virtue of their higher placed finish in the league.
In the final they met another team from Tuscany, Grosseto, drawing 0–0 at home and winning 1–0 away thanks to a goalkeeping error. For the first time ever, Frosinone were promoted to Serie B.
For their first season at Serie B level, the club made several signings to keep the team competitive. They included Massimo Margiotta, Francesco Lodi, Lucas Rimoldi and Fabio Di Venanzio. Meanwhile, work began on restructuring the Stadium Matusa, whose capacity was increased from 5,000 to almost 10,000 seats.
The first game of the season was a 1–0 loss away at the Stadio Nereo Rocco against Triestina. This was followed by draws at home against Spezia and Arezzo and another away defeat at Rimini. Their first victory came away from home at the Stadio Romeo Menti against Vicenza. It finished 2–1 with goals from Margiotta and Di Nardo.
Among the most important victories of the season were the 2–1 wins against Bologna and Lecce and the thrilling 1–0 win against Bari, where the goalkeeper Zappino saved a penalty. On 28 October 2006, Frosinone met giants Juventus. A goal from Alessandro Del Piero (his 200th for Juve) decided the game, however the Frusinati returned home with their heads held high.
The season concluded with a draw against Modena, and Frosinone finished 13th, a more than satisfactory position for their debut season.
"The Canarini" improved on this during their second Serie B season, finishing 10th in 2007–08, and for much of the season were in real contention for a play-off place and a highly unlikely promotion to Serie A.
On 21 May 2011, the club was relegated from Serie B to Lega Pro Prima Divisione after finishing bottom of the table.
From third tier to Serie A.
On 7 June 2014, Frosinone, under the guidance of head coach Roberto Stellone, was promoted from Lega Pro Prima Divisione to Serie B after winning the playoff 1–1, 3–1 (4–2 aggregate) against Lecce.
In the 2014–15 Serie B season, Frosinone quickly emerged as a surprise package for a Serie A spot, fighting against more renowned teams such as Vicenza and Bologna for a top flight place. On 16 May 2015, Frosinone won automatic promotion after a 3–1 home win against Crotone, six points ahead of third-placed Bologna with only one game remaining; this meant the club would make its first Serie A appearance in the 2015–16 season.
Frosinone's maiden Serie A campaign began in a difficult style, losing their first four outings and dropping to bottom place in the table. In Round 5, the club came up against Italian football heavyweights Juventus at the Juventus Stadium. Defying all odds, Frosinone came away with a first ever Serie A point, thanks to an equalising last minute Leonardo Blanchard header, to end the match in a 1–1 draw. The following round, Frosinone achieved their first Serie A win, defeating Empoli 2–0 at the Stadio Matusa. Frosinone achieved their second and third consecutive home wins by beating Sampdoria by the same scoreline as in the Empoli game, and then they beat fellow newly promoted side Carpi 2–1. Frosinone Calcio were relegated back to Serie B after one season in Serie A as they finished in 19th place.
On 29 May 2017, Frosinone lost the semifinal promotion playoff against Carpi, remaining in Serie B.
On 16 June 2018, Frosinone was promoted to Serie A for the second time in their history, defeating Palermo 2–0 at home to win 3–2 on aggregate in the promotion play-off finals after a 2–1 loss in the first leg. They were relegated back to Serie B after one season at top level. In their first season back in Serie B, Frosinone missed out on promotion after losing in the playoff final to Spezia.
On 25 May 2019, Frosinone was relegated again after having a bad season, and on their last matchday they tied 0–0 against Chevo Verona.
On 19 May 2023, after four years of playing in Serie B, Frosinone were promoted to Serie A after being leaders of Serie B, and winning 3–2 against Ternana on their last matchday, and even beating Napoli 4–0 in the round of 16 of the Coppa Italia.
Colours and symbols.
The first social colours of the club were red and blue. Now they are yellow and blue. Since the 2007–08 season, the club has had a mascot called Lillo, represented by a lion, the animal that appears in the coat of arms. The name was chosen by fans of Frosinone with a poll on the club's official website. The mascot accompanies the home team, and, from the 2008–09 season, there is also a chance to be selected, on request, to impersonate Lillo for a game.

Stadiums.
Frosinone has always played its home games at the Stadio Comunale di Frosinone, nicknamed the "Matusa" because of the age of the structure. Founded in what was then the outskirts of the city, today, as a result of the massive urban growth of the city, it is set in the centre of the capital of Frosinone surrounded by several buildings. It has undergone several reconstructions but never related to the foundational structure of the grandstand, which is still the one from the foundation.
Over the years, also depending on the results of the team, it has had different capacities. In 2014 it could accommodate approximately 10,000 spectators.
In the eighties the new Stadio Casaleno began to be built in short distance of the area. The progress, which led to the construction of a grandstand, however, was interrupted as a result of scandals and erroneous projects and led to the temporary decline of the team. For several years projects have been proposed to complete the structure and give Frosinone a new stadium, but the idea, as well as complex bureaucratic loopholes and economic issues, has also seen resistance from many fans who prefer to play in the old historic stadium.
In 2007, in order to unlock the stalemate that concerned the management of the old Matusa and the construction of the new municipal stadium, some fans of the club, as a provocative gesture, put the stadium up for auction on eBay for a single euro, though in a few hours the bidding price was over €8 million.
The record of spectators in a game inside of the Matusa dates back to the Serie C1 championship of 1988–89, with about 12,000 spectators for a match against Campobasso.
Starting from October 2017, Frosinone plays its home games at Benito Stirpe stadium. The record number of spectators at a game inside of the Stirpe in Serie B championship of 2017–2018, was about 16,286 spectators for a match against Foggia.
In November 2017, Frosinone Calcio launched the first ever public mini-bond investment scheme in Italian football via sports investment platform Tifosy. Frosinone Calcio president Maurizio Stirpe mentions that the proceeds of the mini-bond would be used to:"build the medical center (intended for all those who gravitate around the world of Frosinone Calcio) and the restaurant , both located in the belly of the central grandstand.
With the resources that the club aims to collect through crowdfunding the ring around the stadium could also be restructured , with the rebuilding of the flooring, so as to allow citizens who use these spaces to run and train themselves to have a more functional space to these activities".The Frosinone Bond raised €1,500,000 which was €500,000 over what the club initially thought the bond would raise.

SS Lazio

Professional Italian sports club based in Rome
Football club
 (; BIT: SSL; "Lazio Sport Club"), commonly referred to as Lazio, is an Italian professional sports club based in Rome, most known for its football activity. The society, founded in 1900, plays in the Serie A and have spent most of their history in the top tier of Italian football. Lazio have been Italian champions twice (1974, 2000), and have won the Coppa Italia seven times, the Supercoppa Italiana three times, and both the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup on one occasion.
The club had their first major success in 1958, winning the domestic cup. In 1974, they won their first Serie A title. The 1990s were the most successful period in Lazio's history, with the team reaching the UEFA Cup final in 1998, winning the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 1999, and clinching the Serie A title in 2000. Due to a severe economic crisis in 2002 that forced president Sergio Cragnotti out of the club along with several star players being sold, Lazio's success in the league declined. In spite of the lower funds, the club has won four Coppa Italia titles since then; in 2004, 2009, 2013 and 2019. Current president Claudio Lotito took charge of the club in 2004, filling the vacuum that had existed following Cragnotti's departure.
Lazio's traditional kit colours are sky blue shirts and white shorts with white socks; the colours are reminiscent of Rome's ancient Hellenic legacy. Sky blue socks have also been interchangeably used as home colours. Their home is the 70,634 capacity Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which they share with Roma. Lazio have a long-standing rivalry with Roma, with whom they have contested the "Derby della Capitale" (in English "Derby of the capital city" or Rome derby) since 1929.
Despite initially not having any parent–subsidiary relation with the male and female professional team (that was incorporated as S.S. Lazio S.p.A.), the founding of allowed for the club that participates in over 40 different sports disciplines in total.
History.
"Società Podistica Lazio" was founded on 9 January 1900 in the Prati district of Rome. Until 1910, the club played at an amateur level until it officially joined the league competition in 1912 as soon as the Italian Football Federation began organising championships in the center and south of Italy, and reached the final of the national championship playoff three times, but never won, losing in 1913 to Pro Vercelli, in 1914 to Casale and in 1923 to Genoa 1893. In 1927, Lazio was the only major Roman club which resisted the Fascist regime's attempts to merge all the city's teams into what would become Roma the same year. The club played in the first organised Serie A in 1929 and, led by legendary Italian striker Silvio Piola, achieved a second-place finish in 1937 – its highest pre-war result.
The 1950s produced a mix of mid and upper table results, with a Coppa Italia win in 1958. Lazio was relegated for the first time in 1961 to Serie B, but returned in the top flight two years later. After a number of mid-table placements, another relegation followed in 1970–71. Back to Serie A in 1972–73, Lazio immediately emerged as surprise challengers for the "Scudetto" to Milan and Juventus in 1972–73, only losing out on the final day of the season, with a team comprising captain Giuseppe Wilson, as well as midfielders Luciano Re Cecconi and Mario Frustalupi, striker Giorgio Chinaglia, and head coach Tommaso Maestrelli. Lazio improved such successes the following season, ensuring its first title in 1973–74. However, tragic deaths of Re Cecconi and "Scudetto" trainer Maestrelli, as well as the departure of Chinaglia, would be a triple blow for Lazio. The emergence of Bruno Giordano during this period provided some relief as he finished League top scorer in 1979, when Lazio finished eighth.
Lazio were forcibly relegated to Serie B in 1980, due to a remarkable scandal concerning illegal bets on their own matches, along with Milan. They remained in Italy's second division for three seasons, in what would mark the darkest period in Lazio's history. They would return in 1983 and manage a last-day escape from relegation the following season. The 1984–85 season would prove harrowing, with a pitiful 15 points and bottom place finish.
In 1986, Lazio was hit with a nine-point deduction (a true deathblow back in the day of the two-point win) for a betting scandal involving player Claudio Vinazzani. An epic struggle against relegation followed the same season in Serie B, with the club led by trainer Eugenio Fascetti only avoiding relegation to the Serie C after play-off wins over Taranto and Campobasso. This would prove a turning point in the club's history, with Lazio returning to Serie A in 1988 and, under the careful financial management of Gianmarco Calleri, the consolidation of the club's position as a solid top-flight club.
The arrival of Sergio Cragnotti in 1992 changed the club's history, due to his long-term investments in new players to make the team a "Scudetto" competitor. A notable early transfer during his tenure was the capture of English midfielder Paul Gascoigne from Tottenham Hotspur for £5.5 million. Gascoigne's transfer to Lazio is credited with the increase of interest in Serie A in the United Kingdom during the 1990s. Cragnotti repeatedly broke transfer records in pursuit of players who were considered major stars – Juan Sebastián Verón for £18 million, Christian Vieri for £19 million and breaking the world transfer record, albeit only for a matter of weeks, to sign Hernán Crespo from Parma for £35 million.
Lazio were Serie A runners-up in 1995, third in 1996 and fourth in 1997, then losing the championship just by one point to Milan on the last championship's match in 1999 before, with the likes of Siniša Mihajlović, Alessandro Nesta, Marcelo Salas and Pavel Nedvěd in the side, winning its second "Scudetto" in 2000, as well as the Coppa Italia double with Sven-Göran Eriksson (1997–2001) as manager.
Lazio had two more Coppa Italia triumphs in 1998 and 2004, as well as the last UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1999. They also reached the UEFA Cup final, but lost 0–3 against Internazionale. In addition, Lazio won the Supercoppa Italiana twice and defeated Manchester United in 1999 to win the UEFA Super Cup. In 2000, Lazio became also the first Italian football club to be quoted on the Italian Piazza Affari stock market.
With money running out, Lazio's results slowly worsened in the years. In 2002, a financial scandal involving Cragnotti and his food products multinational Cirio forced him to leave the club, and Lazio was controlled until 2004 by caretaker financial managers and a bank pool. This forced the club to sell their star players and even fan favourite captain Alessandro Nesta. In 2004, entrepreneur Claudio Lotito acquired the majority of the club. In 2006, the club qualified to the 2006–07 UEFA Cup under coach Delio Rossi. The club, however, was excluded from European competitions due to their involvement in the 2006 Italian football scandal.
In the 2006–07 season, despite a later-reduced points deduction, Lazio achieved a third-place finish, thus gaining qualification to the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round, where they defeated Dinamo București to reach the group phase, and ended fourth place in the group composed of Real Madrid, Werder Bremen and Olympiacos. Things in the league did not go much better, with the team spending most of the season in the bottom half of the table, sparking the protests of the fans, and eventually ending the Serie A season in 12th place. In the 2008–09 season, Lazio won their fifth Coppa Italia, beating Sampdoria in the final.
Lazio started the 2009–10 season playing the Supercoppa Italiana against Inter in Beijing and winning the match 2–1, with goals from Matuzalém and Tommaso Rocchi. Lazio won the 2012–13 Coppa Italia 1–0 over rivals Roma, with the lone goal coming from Senad Lulić. Lazio won the 2018–19 Coppa Italia 2–0 over Atalanta, winning their seventh title overall.
Colours, badge and nicknames.
 
First kit ever worn by the club
Lazio's colours of white and sky blue were inspired by the national emblem of Greece, due to the fact that Lazio is a mixed sports club this was chosen in recognition of the fact that the Ancient Olympic Games and along with it the sporting tradition in Europe is linked to Greece.
Originally, Lazio wore a shirt which was divided into white and sky blue quarters, with black shorts and socks. After a while of wearing a plain white shirt very early on, Lazio reverted to the colours which they wear today. Some seasons Lazio have used a sky blue and white shirt with stripes, but usually it is sky blue with a white trim, with the white shorts and socks. The club's colours have led to their Italian nickname of "Biancocelesti".
Lazio's traditional club badge and symbol is the eagle, which was chosen by founding member Luigi Bigiarelli. A symbol of the Roman legions and emperor, it was chosen to represent power and victory; it also identifies the club with its origin city. Lazio's use of the symbol has led to two of their nicknames; "le Aquile" ("the Eagles") and "Aquilotti" ("Eaglets"). The current club badge features a golden eagle above a white shield with a blue border; inside the shield is the club's name and a smaller tripartite shield with the colours of the club.
Stadium.
Stadio Olimpico, located on the Foro Italico, is the major stadium of Rome. It is the home of the Italy national football team as well as of both local teams Lazio and Roma. It was opened in 1937 and after its latest renovation in 2008, the stadium has a capacity of 70,634 seats. It was the site of the 1960 Summer Olympics, but has also served as the location of the 1987 World Athletics Championships, the 1980 European Championship final, the 1990 World Cup and the Champions League Final in 1996 and 2009.
Also on the Foro Italico lies the Stadio dei Marmi, or "marble stadium", which was built in 1932 and designed by Enrico Del Debbio. It has tiers topped by 60 white marble statues that were gifts from Italian cities in commemoration of 60 athletes.
During the 1989–90 season, Lazio and Roma played their games at the Stadio Flaminio of Rome, located in the district Flaminio, because of the renovation works carried out at the Stadio Olimpico.
In June 2018, Lazio President Claudio Lotito stated that "Lazio should be granted the same favour and treatment as Roma – the ability to also build a new stadium. He also added that "Lazio's stadium will be built before Roma's stadium."
In June 2019, Lazio President Claudio Lotito was set to present the designs of a potential future stadium for Lazio, named the Stadio delle Aquile. However, this did not occur for reasons unknown.
Supporters and rivalries.
Lazio is the sixth-most supported football club in Italy and the second in Rome, with around 2% of Italian football fans supporting the club (according to "La Repubblica's" research of August 2008). Historically, the largest section of Lazio supporters in the city of Rome has come from the far northern section, creating an arch-like shape across Rome with affluent areas such as Parioli, Prati, Flaminio, Cassia and Monte Mario.
Founded in 1987, "Irriducibili Lazio" were the club's biggest ultras group for over 30 years. They typically create traditional Italian ultra displays during the "Derby della Capitale" (Rome Derby), the match between Lazio and their main rivals, Roma. It is amongst the most heated and emotional footballing rivalries in the world, such as where Lazio fan Vincenzo Paparelli was killed at one of the derby games during the 1979–80 season after being hit in the eye by an emergency rocket thrown by a Roma fan. A minority of Lazio's ultras used to use swastikas and fascist symbols on their banners, and they have displayed racist behaviour in several occasions during the derbies. Most notably, at a derby of the season 1998–99, laziali unfurled a 50-metre banner around the Curva Nord that read, "Auschwitz is your town, the ovens are your houses". Black players of Roma have often been receivers of racist and offensive behaviour. After 33 years, the Irriducibili disbanded on 27 February 2020, citing "too much blood, too many banning orders, too many arrests." Lazio's ultras now go by the name "Ultras Lazio". Lazio also have a strong rivalry with Napoli and Livorno, as well as with Pescara and Atalanta. The club also maintains strong competitive rivalries with Fiorentina, Juventus and Milan.
Conversely, the ultras have friendly relationships with Internazionale, Triestina and Hellas Verona. Internationally, Lazio's fans maintain a long-standing strong friendship with the supporters of the Bulgarian club Levski Sofia and as such, Lazio were invited to participate in the centenary football match honouring the birthday of the Bulgarian club.

In 1998, during Sergio Cragnotti's period in charge as the chairman, Società Sportiva Lazio S.p.A. became a listed company: Lazio were the first Italian club to do so. However, Cragnotti resigned as chairman in 2001, after a "huge hole in the budget" of the club.
Claudio Lotito, the current chairman of Lazio, purchased the club from Cragnotti in 2004, but owned just 26.969% of shares as the largest shareholders at that time. It was followed by banking group Capitalia (and its subsidiaries Mediocredito Centrale, Banca di Roma and Banco di Sicilia) as the second largest shareholders for 17.717%. Capitalia also hold 49% stake of Italpetroli (via Capitalia's subsidiary Banca di Roma), the parent company of city rival Roma (via Italpetroli's subsidiary "Roma 2000"). Lotito later purchased the minority stake from Capitalia.
As of 2018[ [update]], Claudio Lotito owns just over two-thirds of the shares of Lazio. Lazio is one of only three Italian clubs listed on the Borsa Italiana, the others being Juventus and Roma. In the past, Lazio was the only one with a single primary share holder (Lotito). However, following several capital increases by Roma and Juventus, they also are significantly owned by a shareholder. According to The Football Money League, published by consultants Deloitte, in the 2004–05 season, Lazio was the 20th highest earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of €83 million; the 2005 ranking of the club was 15th. However, in 2016 ranking (the rank used data in 2014–15 season), Lazio was not in the top 20.
Lazio was one of the few clubs that self-sustain from the financial support of a shareholder, and also consistently make an aggregate profit after every season. Unlike Internazionale, Roma and Milan, who were sanctioned by UEFA due to breaches of Financial Fair Play, Lazio passed the regulations held by the administrative body with the high achievements. Lotito also received a prize that joint awarded by Associazione Italiana Allenatori Calcio and DGS Sport&amp;Cultura, due to Lazio's financial health.
In 2017, the club renewed their sponsorship deal with shirt manufacturer Macron. It was worth €16 million a season, plus variables of about €9 million stemming from league and European competition finishes.
In February 2022, Lazio announced that they had parted ways with Macron after 10 years. Mizuno would become the team’s new sportswear and technical gear provider, with the Biancocelesti receiving €20 million over the next five years as a result of their new agreement with the Japanese company.
In March 2022, Lazio released their financial reports from June to December 2021 which showed a decrease in revenue (from €106.66 to €71.56 million) but an increase in profit (from -€0.12 million to €4.6 million) compared to the previous six months.

US Pistoiese 1921

Italian football club
Football club
Unione Sportiva Pistoiese 1921 is an Italian association football club, based in Pistoia, Tuscany. Currently, Pistoiese plays in Serie D. Originally founded on 21 April 1921 and later restored after bankruptcy, the team plays their home games in the Municipal Stadium of Pistoia named after Marcello Melani.
The singer-songwriter Francesco Guccini is probably the most famous "tifoso" of Pistoiese in Italy.
History.
Since its inception "la societá arancione" (Orange Society) founded on April 21, 1921, has been characterized by its European inclinations, being the city historically a crossroads of historical-religious paths to and from the geographical areas of the Old Continent.
It is no coincidence that among the protagonists of the birth of "l’Arancione" you will find the Hungarians Árpád Hajós and János Nehadoma, with the jersey inspired by that of Holland, which, like the city of Pistoia, boasts a strong floriculture.
In 1927 Pistoiese won their first major honours winning the Arpinati Cup. After winning minor regional championships they were elected to play in the National Division in 1928.
Between 1929 and 1936 they participated in the campionato cadetto finishing first on a couple of occasions. US Pistoiese played their last championship in 1939–40.
Pistoiese Sports Union.
Competitive football resumed in 1945 when a group of fans re-founded the team as Pistoiese Sports Union and was admitted to the Serie C. The following were to be characterized by a series of ups and downs between Serie C, Serie D, and the Promozione Championship, with a brief period in Serie B immediately after the Second World War, in which a third-place position was reached.
From 1946 to 1956–57, the team started that fluctuation between the leagues until Vannino Vannucci rose to the presidency in 1956–57 and Pistoiese became a "Jewel in the Nile" at a cost of 100 million lire.
In the 1958–59 championship, Pistoiese went 21 consecutive games without defeat, in this time amassing 36 points from a possible 42 (2 points for a win) and scoring 45 goals. Most memorable is the match against Empoli, a local rival and competitor for the promotion. The Arancione won 6–0. The final standing that season read 77 goals scored and 24 conceded. After 8 years, they had again reached Serie C.
In the 1960s, the team participated for ten consecutive seasons in Serie C.
U.S. Pistoiese.
Pistoiese achieved prominence by rising to Serie B in the late 1970s with promotion to Serie A following in 1980. Under the presidency of Marcello Melani, who chose veterans like Marcello Lippi and Mario Frustalupi and promising young talents such as Paolo Benedetti, Pistoiese reached Serie A in just 6 years and made a reasonable start, reaching as high as 6th after a win at Fiorentina in Round 13. But a dismal freefall resulted in a last-place finish and relegation. Since 1980, the club has only managed two stretches in Serie B (1995–96 and 1999–2002). Melani left his post in 1980, followed by Lippi in 1981.
A.C. Nuova Pistoiese 1988.
In the 2005–06 Serie C1/B campaign, Pistoiese battled against relegation from Serie C1 with goals proving hard to come by, yet having one of the best defensive records in the division. A good end to the season brought the team to a 9th-place finish in Group A, which was three points ahead of the relegation playoff. Pistoiese finished 14th in Group B in the 2007–08 season and competed in a relegation play-off against Sangiovannese. They won by 4–0 aggregate and remained in Lega Pro Prima Divisione (former Serie C1).
The Tuscan club started the 2008–09 season with Roberto Miggiano as head coach, but disappointing results and a last-place position in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione table led the club to replace him with Salvatore Polverino later in October. However, results did not improve under new boss Polverino, prompting him to tender his resignation in February 2009. He was replaced by former Juventus star Moreno Torricelli, in his first stint as a professional head coach; under Torricelli's reign, Pistoiese managed to improve results and escape immediate relegation ending in 16th place. Nevertheless, Pistoiese lost a play-off against Foligno and was relegated to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.
In the summer of 2009, Pistoiese was not permitted enrollment in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione due to inadequate finances.
Unione Sportiva Pistoiese 1921.
On 13 August 2009 Unione Sportiva Pistoiese 1921 was created by Pistoia's mayor, Berti. The club was admitted to Tuscany's Eccellenza league and managed an excellent inaugural year, reaching the play-off for promotion, where it eventually lost to Mosciano.
In the 2010–11 season, it won Eccellenza Tuscany group A and was thus promoted to Serie D. Pistoiese managed to reacquire professional status after winning the Girone E of 2013–14 Serie D, thus ensuring a spot in the 2014–15 Lega Pro. In the next season reach once the national play-offs for Serie B.
In January 2021, the club was acquired by German entrepreneur Stefan Lehmann, the first foreign owner in Pistoiese history. Despite the new owner, the team relegated to Serie D after losing the tie against Imolese. In the following season (2022-23) Pistoiese fails to reach the first position (arriving second), thus not returning to Serie C.

Casale FBC

Italian football club
Football club
ASD Casale Foot Ball Club (formerly AS Casale Calcio) is an Italian football club, based in Casale Monferrato, Piedmont.
The club plays in Serie D.
The team's nickname "nerostellati" ("the starred-blacks") refers to the team's colours of black with a white star on the chest.
History.
When the club was founded in 1909 Casale was at the geographical center of the new footballing movement in Italy.
Genoa, Pro Vercelli, Milan, Torino, and Juventus were all leading clubs in the Italian football league system and Casale soon joined their number.
In May 1913 Casale became the first Italian club to defeat an English professional team when they beat Reading F.C. 2–1. Reading won all the other games on this tour, defeating Genoa, Milan, Pro Vercelli, and even the Italy national team.
In the following season, Casale won their first and only national title. Italian football was then organized on a regional basis and the national championship was divided into three stages. Casale topped the Ligurian-Piedmontese division and proceeded, along with second-placed Genoa, to compete in a division comprising the top northern teams, the others being Inter Milan, Juventus, Vicenza and Verona. Having won that division, Casale defeated central-southern champions Lazio 7–1, 0–2 in the two-leg final.
After World War I, Casale remained in the top division for a couple of decades, representing what had been the cradle of early Italian football.
With the development of professionalism, Casale was progressively relegated to lower divisions, 1934 being their last year in Serie A. The club was later refounded twice, in 1993 and 2013, after financial problems. In 2013, it took the current name of Casale Foot Ball Club.
A heated rivalry exists between the fans of Casale and Alessandria.

Notable players.
Five players who appeared in the scudetto-winning team of 1913–14 played in the Italy national team, all making their international debuts between 1912 and 1914:
One of Casale's biggest stars, however, was the full back Umberto Caligaris whose career with the club ran from 1919 to 1928. During his period with the "nerostellati", he made 37 appearances for Italy national football team, featuring at the 1924 Summer Olympics and winning a bronze medal at the 1928 Summer Olympics before leaving Casale for Juventus. His total of 59 caps stood as a record for about 40 years.
Eraldo Monzeglio, later to represent Italy on numerous occasions, including the 1934 and 1938 World Cups, made his Serie A debut with Casale in 1923–24. The following season, however, he moved to Bologna.
Piero Operto, left back of the Grande Torino perished in the Superga air disaster, played with Casale in the years 1946–1948.

AC Legnano

Italian football club
Football club
Associazione Calcio Dilettantistica Legnano, commonly referred to as Legnano, is an Italian football club based in Legnano, Lombardy.
Founded in 1913, Legnano played three seasons in Serie A and a total of eleven seasons in the top tier of the Italian football league system.
Legnano's most recent appearance in Serie A dates back to 1954, whereas in 1957 the club took part for the last time – to date – in a Serie B championship (the second tier of Italian football).
Since then the club have played at their highest at the third tier of the Italian league.
The team's colours are lilac and white.
After financial struggles and bankruptcy in 2010 the club folded and reformed in 2011 as ASD Legnano Calcio 1913; in 2015 they regained the right to name themselves ACD Legnano Calcio and to merge their history with the one of the 97-year-old club previously folded.
History.
Foundation.
The club were founded in 1913 as "Football Club Legnano".
Several notable players appeared for Legnano in its early years. Goalkeeper Angelo Cameroni was called up to the Italy national side in 1920; he was the first Legnano player to achieve this. Luigi Allemandi played four seasons with the club from 1921 onwards, until he was bought by Italian giants Juventus. He later won the World Cup with Italy at the 1934 FIFA World Cup.
Serie A: Club at their peak.
Legnano first gained access to Serie A for the 1930–31 season; the previous year they had finished as runners up in Serie B. The first match at the top level of Italian football was the shocking 2–1 defeat of Italy's oldest club, Genoa C.F.C.
Unfortunately for Legnano, they finished at the bottom of the table that season and were relegated; other notable results however were a 1–1 draw with eventual runners up A.S. Roma, and a 2–1 defeat of S.S.C. Napoli in Naples.
In the 1935–1936 season, the club changed their name to "Associazione Calcio Legnano".
Left-winger Emilio Caprile was called up by "the azzurri", to play in two international games during 1948. He became the first Legnano player to score for Italy with a goal in each match.
Slide down the Italian league.
After their last relegation in from Serie A in 1953–54, the club have gradually declined. First they came close to promotion back into the league with a 3rd position in B, but two years later they were relegated down to Serie C.
Legnano spent 18 years in a row competing in Serie C, only able to finish as high as 5th in that time (they achieved this three times). 1974–75 saw the club slump down to Serie D; this was soon rectified as coach Luciano Sassi pulled the club back into Serie C2 with a runners up spot in 1977–78.
Giovanni Mari lifts Legnano.
Giovanni Mari took over as club president in 1979 and under him, Legnano would achieve the championship of Serie C2. This was the first time A.C. Legnano had finished first position in any league since 1919. The club's stadium was later named Stadio Giovanni Mari in honour of the man.
The refoundation.
Following bankruptcy in 2010, Legnano subsequently folded.
It was refounded on 15 July 2011, as "A.S.D. Legnano Calcio 1913" and was admitted to Group N of Prima Categoria Lombardy in the 2011–12 season. The club was promoted to Group A of Promozione Lombardy.
The club had a successive second promotion after finishing as champions of Group A of Promozione Lombardy next season and was promoted to Group A of Eccellenza Lombardy.
On 7 May 2015, A.S.D. Legnano Calcio 1913 re-acquired the name "Associazione Calcio Legnano". They finished Eccellenza Lombardy as 4th in 2014–15 but were eliminated in the play-offs. They finished Group A of Eccellanza Lombardy as 2nd and were qualified for the play-offs again. They defeated Torviscosa with 4–1 aggregate in semifinal and Sankt Georgen with 4–3 aggregate in final and were promoted to Serie D.

Benevento Calcio

Italian professional football team
Football club
Benevento Calcio, commonly referred to as Benevento, is a professional football club based in Benevento, Campania. The club was originally founded in 1929 and then re-founded in 2005. They currently compete in Serie C, having been relegated from Serie B in the 2022–23 season.
History.
Early history.
The club was founded as Associazione Calcio Benevento in 1929, their original home was the "Meomartini" which was built by Ciccio Minocchia.
After working their way up the country's lower divisions during their early years, Benevento reached Prima Divisione, Italy's third highest professional league at the time, in the 1934–35 season. They finished above clubs such as Reggina during the club's first season within the league. Although they did not win promotion to Serie B, the team did remain in the third tier of Italian football for the 1935–36 season, re-organized to a smaller 64-team league renamed Serie C.
21st century.
The club F.C. Sporting Benevento S.r.l. folded in 2005. At the same time Benevento Calcio S.p.A. was founded, using the same stadium and playing kit.
In the 2007–08 Serie C2 regular season the team finished first in Girone C, winning direct promotion to the now called Lega Pro Prima Divisione for the 2008–09 season. In the 2008–09 season, Benevento's first season in Lega Pro Prima Divisione, they finished in 2nd place. This meant Benevento would be in a two-legged play-off. They won their first two-legged play-off, but lost to Crotone 1–0 (2–1) on aggregate in the final.
Gaetano Auteri was appointed as the head manager for the 2015–16 season. In this season, Benevento won its league and reached Serie B for the first time in its history. The mathematical certainty arrived on 30 April 2016, after defeating Lecce 3–0.
On 8 June 2017, they were promoted to Serie A, for the first time in their history, after defeating Carpi in the Serie B play-offs 1–0 on aggregate, remarkably winning promotion in their inaugural season in Serie B. The club struggled in its top-flight debut in the 2017-18 season as Benevento set a record for the worst start to a season in any of Europe's top five leagues by losing their first 14 Serie A matches. This streak ended on 3 December 2017, with a 95th-minute equalising header from goalkeeper Alberto Brignoli for a 2–2 home draw against A.C. Milan. Benevento's time in Serie A lasted one season and they were relegated after a last-place finish, although there was a clear uptick in form after their dismal opening to the campaign, ultimately winning six of their last 23 games.
On 22 June 2019, Benevento hired Filippo Inzaghi as their new manager. In June 2020, with seven matches still left in the league season, the club won promotion back to the first-division of Italian football following an impressive Serie B campaign.
Benevento's second season in Serie A was again unsuccessful, ending with another relegation, but the club was much more competitive and performed particularly admirably in the first half of the season, which included a run of only one loss in eight matches. By the campaign's midway point, Benevento had won six matches and was placed in 10th position, appearing well-set for a mid-table finish. However, a dramatic downturn in form from January until the end of the campaign, scoring only 16 goals and winning just one of the final 22 matches in that time, meant that the club again fell back into Serie B for the 2021–22 season. Curiously, the match they won was a 1–0 away victory on March 21 against powerhouse Juventus, with the first match finishing in a draw, being one of the only teams Juventus failed to beat. Benevento eventually finished in 18th place, with four points fewer than Torino in the final non-relegation position.
In the 2021–22 Serie B the team tries to return to Serie A and ends the regular season in 7th position gaining access to the promotion play-offs by overcoming Ascoli. They were later eliminated by Pisa in the semifinals.
The 2022–23 Serie B marks the decline of the team who spent most of the season at the bottom of the table. On the penultimate matchday came the mathematical certainty of returning to Serie C by finishing the campaign in 20th position. 
Colours and badge.
The team's colours are yellow and red, and their badge features red and yellow stripes and the black image of a witch riding a broom. Benevento are nicknamed the "Stregoni", Italian for sorcerers, or occasionally, the "Streghe", Italian for witches, a reference to the legends dating to the 13th century of the witches of Benevento.
Stadium.
Benevento plays their home matches at the Stadio Ciro Vigorito. Building on the stadium broke ground in 1976 and it was opened in 1979. It is able to hold 25,000 people.
The stadium was originally named Santa Colomba but was renamed to honor who was the brother of club president . Ciro was a successful entrepreneur and sports manager who was the managing director and oversaw the youth sector at Benevento from 2006 until his death in 2010.

US Sassuolo Calcio

Italian association football club based in Sassuolo
Football club
Unione Sportiva Sassuolo Calcio, commonly referred to as Sassuolo (), is an Italian professional football club based in Sassuolo, Emilia-Romagna. Their colours are black and green, hence the nickname "Neroverdi" (literally "black and greens", in Italian).
Sassuolo have participated in Serie A since the 2013–14 season, joining a select group of teams to have played in Serie A without belonging to a provincial capital city: Savoia (Torre Annunziata), Empoli, Legnano, Pro Patria (Busto Arsizio), Carpi, and Casale.
History.
The club was founded in 1920 and played in the Emilian amateur divisions for most of its history until its first promotion to Serie D in 1968. In this era, the club merged with other local football teams to eventually form the current US Sassuolo Calcio in 1974. In 1984, the club gained promotion to Serie C2, the lowest level of professional football in Italy. However, they were relegated in 1990 and subsequently spent most of the 1990s in Serie D. In 1998, a second-place finish ensured promotion back to Serie C2.
Serie C1.
Sassuolo reached Serie C1 for the first time in 2006 after winning the Serie C2 promotion play-offs by beating Sansovino in the final. In the following years, Sassuolo proved to be a serious contender for promotion to Serie B. With Gian Marco Remondina as head coach, they barely missed it in 2007, as they lost immediate promotion to Grosseto in the final days of the season, finishing in second-place; and then were defeated by fifth-placed Monza in the play-off semi-finals. Remondina then left Sassuolo to join Serie B's Piacenza, and former Serie A player Massimiliano Allegri was then chosen as new head coach.
Under Allegri, Sassuolo quickly revived their hopes to obtain promotion to Serie B; this ultimately came on 27 April 2008, when they won the Serie C1/A title, thus ensuring a historical promotion to Serie B, the first in the club's history.
Serie B.
Following Sassuolo's promotion to the Italian second tier, Allegri left Sassuolo to fill the head coaching position at Serie A team Cagliari. In July 2008, the club appointed former Atalanta and Siena boss Andrea Mandorlini for the 2008–09 season.
Sassuolo had a surprisingly good start to the 2008–09 campaign and held a promotion playoff place for a very long time. They only won two points in their last five matches to eventually finish in seventh place. Despite a successful season, Mandorlini left Sassuolo by mutual consent in June 2009, whereupon the team then appointed former Piacenza coach Stefano Pioli on 11 June 2009.
Sassuolo successively qualified to the Serie B promotion playoffs in 2009–10 by placing fourth, and 2011–12 in third, being eliminated at the semi-finals in both seasons.
In the 2012–13 season, however, under the guidance of new head coach Eusebio Di Francesco, Sassuolo played a majority of the season in first place in the table, and eventually secured direct promotion with a 1-0 victory over Livorno on 18 May 2013. At the conclusion of the season, Sassuolo had won the Serie B title and had ensured a first top-flight campaign ever for the 2013–14 season. The club had reached the highest level of the Italian football league system only seven years after playing in Serie C2. The key role that was played in this achievement by 18-year-old academy product Domenico Berardi saw the player win the league's Player of the Year award.
Serie A.
During pre-season training in July 2013, Sassuolo won the TIM Trophy, after beating Juventus on penalties, then beating Milan 2–1, marking the first time a team other than Milan, Internazionale or Juventus had won the Cup.
On 25 August 2013, Sassuolo played their first-ever Serie A match, a 2–0 loss away at Torino. The team's second match was their first at home, against Livorno, where striker Simone Zaza scored Sassuolo's first top-flight goal as they lost 4–1. On 22 September 2013, Sassuolo endured a heavy 7–0 defeat at home to Internazionale. The team earned their first point in their fifth match, on 25 September away to Napoli. Zaza equalised as the game finished 1–1, ending the hosts' perfect start to the season. This was followed by a first home point on 29 September, a 2–2 draw with Lazio. On 20 October 2013, Sassuolo won their first Serie A game, defeating Bologna 2–1 at home with goals from Domenico Berardi and Antonio Floro Flores, moving the club off bottom place. Sassuolo won away for the first time in Serie A on 3 November against Sampdoria, with Berardi scoring their first top-flight hat-trick to win 4–3. Since the following match, a 1–1 draw at Roma on 10 November, the club has been outside the relegation zone. On 12 January 2014, Berardi was the only player in the season to score four goals in a game, as Sassuolo came from 2–0 down to win 4–3 against Milan. Towards the end of January 2014, Sassuolo were in bottom place and so manager Di Francesco was relieved of his duties and Alberto Malesani was brought in. The managerial change did not have the desired effects and so in early March, Sassuolo re-entrusted the side to the management of Di Francesco. Sassuolo won its away match against Fiorentina 4–3 on 6 May 2014, and after winning 4–2 against Genoa on 11 May, Sassuolo guaranteed its place in Serie A for the 2014–15 season. Berardi finished in equal 7th place in the Serie A top scorers list, with 16 goals for the season.
The Neroverdi had a much better 2014–15 Serie A season, finishing comfortably beyond relegation in 12th place. Berardi was once more the club's top goalscorer with 15 league goals.
Sassuolo improved again in the 2015–16 Serie A season, finishing ahead of the likes of Milan and Lazio in sixth place. The season included an opening day win over Napoli, a Round 10 1–0 victory over Juventus at Mapei Stadium and a 1–0 victory over Inter at the San Siro.
On 21 May 2016, Sassuolo achieved their first ever Europa League qualification after finishing sixth in 2015–16 courtesy of a Juventus Coppa Italia win over Milan, as Milan would have gone to Europe instead if they had won the final. On 25 August 2016, Sassuolo qualified for the Europa League group stage after beating Red Star Belgrade 4–1 on aggregate in the playoff round.
Over the following three seasons, the Neroverdi returned to mid-table, ending the 2016–17 season in 12th position, and then the club followed this up with consecutive 11th place finishes in 2018 and 2019, as well being knocked out in the round of 16 in three successive Coppa Italia campaigns. In the home match against Lazio on 25 February 2018, club captain Francesco Magnanelli made his 400th appearance for Sassuolo since joining the club's in its most recent spell in Serie C2 in 2005, having led the Neroverdi through three promotions and also playing in European competition in that time. On 13 June 2018, Roberto De Zerbi was appointed as manager, after impressing with his possession-based tactics at relegated Benevento in the previous season.
The 2019–20 season oversaw an improvement in Sassuolo's fortunes. The club concluded the season in 8th position, just outside the final qualifying position for the UEFA Europa League, marking only the second top-half Serie A finish in its history. A primary reason for Sassuolo's growth was due to De Zerbi's innovative, attack-minded style of play, which began to flourish and led to a record-breaking Serie A goal return of 69, the most prolific the club had been since promotion in 2013. The transfer of Francesco Caputo from Empoli in the preceding off-season was particularly crucial to this, as the striker ended the campaign with 21 league goals, and wingers Jérémie Boga and Domenico Berardi also achieved double-figure goal tallies.
The club continued its development as a top 10 team in Serie A in the following season, in which the record of 61 points in 2015–16 was broken, with another 8th place finish on 62 points. After eight matches, Sassuolo was placed second in the table, which in part was the result of the excellent form of the likes of Berardi, Manuel Locatelli, Filip Đuričić, amongst others. An impressive 2–0 away win against Napoli on matchday six was perhaps the best reflection of this impressive early-season form. Although the club's form declined slightly in the mid-stage of the season, a 2–0 victory over Lazio on the final matchday meant that Sassuolo reached the same points total as Roma in 7th place, but narrowly missed out on European qualification on goal difference. Berardi, in his eighth professional season with the club, enjoyed the best year of his career with 17 league goals and his double in a 3–1 against Fiorentina on 17 April 2021 meant that he had reached 100 goals in all competitions for the Neroverdi. De Zerbi announced he would leave the club at the end of the season to take up the vacant head coach position at Shakhtar Donetsk. On 11 July 2021, Sassuolo's Manuel Locatelli, Domenico Berardi and Giacomo Raspadori were part of the Italy national squad that defeated England in the UEFA Euro 2020 final.
Stadium and kit.
Sassuolo's home stadium is the Stadio Enzo Ricci in Sassuolo, still used by the club for training, but due to its tiny capacity (4,000) the club played Serie B seasons in Modena's Stadio Alberto Braglia.
Starting from the 2013–14 season, the first Serie A campaign for the club, Sassuolo plays in Reggio Emilia at the renovated Mapei Stadium – Città del Tricolore (formerly Stadio Giglio) in a venue-sharing agreement with Lega Pro Prima Divisione club Reggiana. The stadium was also bought by the parent company of Sassuolo, Mapei.
Sassuolo's famous green kit originates from a donation from English side Lancaster Rovers FC. During a tour of Italy in 1921, the Rovers side were unable to fulfil a fixture with Sassuolo and as a way of apology, donated their green shirts for Sassuolo to keep.

Genoa CFC

Professional Italian association football and cricket club
Football club
Genoa Cricket and Football Club, commonly referred to as Genoa (), is a professional football club based in Genoa, Liguria, Italy. The team competes in the Serie A, the top division of the Italian football league system.
Established in 1893, Genoa is Italy's oldest extant football team. The club has won the Italian Championship nine times, with their first being Italy's inaugural national championship in 1898 and their most recent coming after the 1923–24 season. They also hold one Coppa Italia title. Overall, Genoa are the fourth most successful Italian club in terms of championships won. "Il Grifone" have played their home games at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris since 1911, which they share with local rivals UC Sampdoria. The fixture between the two teams, known as the Derby della Lanterna, was first contested in 1946.
In 2011, Genoa was included in the "International Bureau of Cultural Capitals" (a sort of historical sporting heritage of humanity, in line with that of UNESCO) at the request of President Xavier Tudela. The club was admitted to the "Club of Pioneers" , an association comprising the world's oldest football clubs, in 2013; other members include Sheffield F.C. and Recreativo de Huelva.
History.
The club was founded on 7 September 1893 as Genoa Cricket &amp; Athletic Club. In its earliest years, it principally competed in athletics and cricket. Association football was only a secondary concern. Since the club was set up to represent England abroad, the original shirts worn by the organisation were white, the same colour as the England national team shirt. At first Italians were not permitted to join as it was a British sporting club abroad. Genoa's activities took place in the north-west of the city in the Campasso area, at the "Piazza d'Armi". The men who initially handled the management of the club were;
On 10 April 1897 the footballing section of the club, already in existence since 1893, became predominant thanks to James Richardson Spensley. It was among the oldest in Italian football at the time, only four other clubs (all in Turin.) had been founded. Italians were allowed to join and found a new ground in the form of "Ponte Carrega".
The first friendly match took place at home, against a mixed team of Internazionale Torino and F.B.C. Torinese; Genoa lost 1–0. Not long after, Genoa recorded its first victory away against UPS Alessandria winning 2–0. Friendly games also took place against various British sailors such as those from .
Championship dominance.
Football in Italy stepped up a level with the creation of the Italian Football Federation and the Italian Football Championship. Genoa competed in the first Italian Championship in 1898 at Velodrome Humbert I in Turin. They defeated Ginnastica Torino 2–1 in their first official game on 8 May, before winning the first championship later that day by beating Internazionale Torino 3–1 after extra-time.
Genoa returned for the following season, this time with a few changes; the name of the club was altered to Genoa Cricket &amp; Football Club, dropping the "Athletic" from its name. A change in shirt colour was also in order, as they changed to white and blue vertical stripes; known in Italy as "biancoblù". Genoa won their second title in a one-day tournament which took place on 16 April 1899, by beating Internazionale Torino 3–1 for the second time. On their way to winning their third consecutive title in 1900 they also beat local rivals Sampierdarenese 7–0; a winning margin which would not be bettered by any team in the league until 1910. The final was secured with a 3–1 win over F.B.C. Torinese.
The club strip was changed again in 1901, Genoa adopted its famous red-navy halves and therefore became known as the "rossoblù"; these are the colours used even to this day as with many other Italian clubs, such as Cagliari, Bologna, Crotone, Cosenza and an endless list of minor clubs. After a season of finishing runners-up to Milan Cricket and Football Club, things were back on track in 1902 with their fourth title. Juventus emerged as serious contenders to Genoa's throne from 1903 onwards, when for two seasons in a row Genoa beat the "Old Lady" in the national final.
Notably Genoa became the first Italian football team to play an international match, when they visited France on 27 April 1903 to play FVC Nice, winning the fixture 3–0. As well as winning the Italian championship in 1904, the year was also notable for Genoa reserves winning the first ever II Categoria league season; a proto-Serie B under the top level. From 1905 onwards when they were runners-up, Genoa lost their foothold on the Italian championship; other clubs such as Juventus, Milan and Pro Vercelli stepped up.
The fall in part during this period can be traced back to 1908 when FIGC agreed to Federal Gymnastics protests forbidding the use of foreign players. Since Genoa's birth they had always had a strong English contingent. They disagreed, as did several other prominent clubs such as Milan, Torino and Firenze; as thus they withdrew from official FIGC competitions that year. The following season the federation reversed the decision and Genoa was rebuilt with players such as Luigi Ferraris and some from Switzerland, such as Daniel Hug who came from FC Basel. The rebuilding of the squad also saw the creation of a new ground in the Marassi area of Genoa, when built it had a capacity of 25,000 and was comparable to British stadiums of the time; it was officially opened on 22 January 1911.
Garbutt revival.
With the introduction of the Italy national football team, Genoa played an important part, with the likes of Renzo De Vecchi; who was "azzurri" captain for some time, Edoardo Mariani and Enrico Sardi earning call-ups. Englishman William Garbutt was brought in as head coach to help revive the club; Garbutt was the first professional manager in Italy and was renowned for being highly charismatic, and also for constantly smoking his tobacco pipe. He was dubbed "Mister" by the players; since then Italians have referred to coaches in general by the term.
Finally by 1914–15, Genoa had restored themselves as the top club from Northern Italy, winning the final round of the Northern section. However, this particular year, the national final could not be played because of the outbreak of World War I, the finals of the Southern Italian section could not be decided and thus Genoa did not have a team to play. Genoa would be awarded the title in 1919 after the end of the war, it would be their first for eleven seasons. The war took a harsh toll on Genoa as players Luigi Ferraris, Adolfo Gnecco, Carlo Marassi, Alberto Sussone and Claudio Casanova all died while on military duty in Italy; while footballing founder James Richardson Spensley was killed in Germany.
In the early part of the next decade, Genoa remained strong contenders in the Northern section. Garbutt led Genoa to championship success in 1922–23; beating Lazio 6–1 in the final, over the course of two legs. The following season, Genoa made their way past Bologna in the Northern finals, but not without controversy; after riots in the second leg during the game in Bologna, the game was called off and FIGC awarded Genoa a 2–0 victory. In the national final that season, Genoa beat Savoia 4–1 over the course of two legs; this would be their ninth and to date final Italian championship.
The squad during these two championship victories included; Giovanni De Prà, Ottavio Barbieri, Luigi Burlando and Renzo De Vecchi. With Genoa's championship victory in 1923–24 came the introduction of the "scudetto" patch; which means following the season within which a club wins an Italian league championship, they are allowed to wear a shield shaped patch on their shirt which features the colours of the Italian flag. For the rest of the 1920s, the club's highest finish was in second place: the 1927–28 season when Genoa finished runners-up to Torino, with striker Felice Levratto scoring 20 goals in 27 games.
Genova 1893 period.
Due to the strongly British connotations attached to the name, Genoa were forced to change it by the fascist government to Genova 1893 Circolo del Calcio in 1928. The club competed in a proto-European Cup in the form of the Mitropa Cup, where they went out in the quarter-finals after losing heavily to Rapid Vienna. They followed this with a runners-up position back at home in the league, they finished behind Ambrosiana in the 1929–30 season; this would be their last top level championship runners-up spot to date.
The club's league form became highly erratic during the early 1930s, with varying league positions; it was during the 1933–34 season that Genova suffered their first ever relegation to Serie B, the second league of Italian football. Thankfully for the club, they were able to bounce back under the management of Vittorio Faroppa, winning promotion by finishing top of their group ahead of Novara. In 1936, the ambitious Juan Culiolo took over as chairman of the club; in 1936–37 they achieved a 6th-place finish and also won the Coppa Italia by beating Roma 1–0 with a goal from Mario Torti.
During the following season Genova finished in third place, this was a particularly tight season with winners Ambrosiana-Inter finishing only three points ahead of the club. That summer Italy competed in the 1938 FIFA World Cup and won, three Genova players formed part of the triumphant squad in the form of Sergio Bertoni, Mario Genta and Mario Perazzolo. The club finished the decade on a high, maintaining a top five foothold in the top level of the Italian football league system.
World War II affected dramatically the entire Italian football movement, but Genova did not recover as well as other clubs. In 1945, the club chose to revert their name to Genoa Cricket and Foot-Ball Club, the one which they had used in the very early days of the Italian championship. In the years just after the war, the club were still popular with the fans, with people previously associated with the club such as Ottavio Barbieri and William Garbutt returning for managerial spells. Genoa also had a new rival in the form of Sampdoria, who were founded by a merger of two other clubs in 1946 and would groundshare at Stadio Luigi Ferraris.
Post-war period.
After the Second World War the ability of Genoa to finish in the upper ranks of Serie A declined in a significant manner; throughout the rest of the 1940s the club were middle-table finishers. The 1948–49 season saw three highly significant results, Genoa beat Inter 4–1, the famous "Grande Torino" side 3–0 and Padova 7–1. The 1950s started in poor fashion for the club, they had bought Argentine Mario Boyé from Boca Juniors but he stayed only one season and the club were relegated after finishing bottom of the table, but after two seasons they achieved their return after winning Serie B, ahead of Legnano. Ragnar Nikolay Larsen was a notable player for the club during this period and they sustained mid-table finishes for the rest of the decade.
Despite suffering a relegation in 1959–60 and then a promotion back up to Serie A in 1961–62, Genoa had a respectable amount of cup success in the first half of the 1960s. The club won the Coppa delle Alpi in 1962; it was the first time the competition had been competed between club teams instead of international ones, the final was played at home while Genoa beat French club Grenoble Foot 38 by 1–0 with a goal from Nizza. Genoa won the same competition again two years later, the final was held at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland; Genoa defeated Catania 2–0, with both goals from Giampaolo Piaceri to take the trophy.
The celebrations for the club did not last long however, as the year following their last cup success they were relegated down to Serie B again. This time their stay in the second tier of the Italian football league system would be far longer than previous relegations, the club was unstable as it changed manager each season. Genoa even experienced their first relegation to Serie C in 1970, financially the club fell into difficulties and had several ownership changes.
Mixed times.
Throughout the 1970s, Genoa would mostly play in the second tier. Under the management of Arturo Silvestri the club made its way back to Serie A for the 1973–74 season, but they were relegated straight back down. For the return of "Il Grifone" to Serie A a couple of seasons later, the squad featured the likes of Roberto Rosato, Bruno Conti and a young Roberto Pruzzo. This time they stuck it out in the top division for two seasons before succumbing to relegation in 1977–78; the relegation was particularly cruel as the side above them Fiorentina survived on goal-difference of just a single goal, the two teams had played each other on the final day of the season ending in a 0–0 draw.
The relegation was bad for the club in more ways than one, they lost some of their top players who could have offered them a swift return; such as Roberto Pruzzo's move to Roma where he would go on to have great success. After a couple of middle-table finishes in Serie B, Genoa earned promotion during the 1980–81 season under manager Luigi Simoni, the club finished as runners-up behind only AC Milan who had been relegated the previous season for their part in the Totonero betting scandal.
Still with Simoni at the helm as manager, Genoa were able to survive in Serie A for their returning season, finishing just one point ahead of the relegated AC Milan. In a dramatic last day of the season, Genoa were trailing 2–1 to Napoli with five minutes left, until on the 85th minute Mario Faccenda scored the goal that secured the point needed by Genoa, starting an owing friendship between the two club's fans.
A couple of seasons later in 1983–84, Genoa would not be so lucky, despite beating champions Juventus on the final day of the season, the club were relegated even though they finished the season with the same number of points as surviving Lazio; this was because Lazio had recorded better results in matches against Genoa.
European experience.
The club was purchased by Calabrese entrepreneur Aldo Spinelli in 1985 and despite no longer having Simoni as manager, Genoa were finishing in the top half of Serie B. After a slip in form during 1987–88 (failing to be promoted by a mere point in 1986–87, then having to struggle not to be retroceded the following season, being spared that fate again by a mere point), Genoa refocused their energy and were able to achieve promotion back into Serie A in 1988–89, finishing as champions ahead of Bari. Genoa, with an experienced trainer as Osvaldo Bagnoli who knew how to get the best out of underdog teams (he managed to win a championship at the helm of Hellas Verona in the eighties) and with a team sporting the talents of Carlos Aguilera and Tomáš Skuhravý among others achieved highs during the 1990–91 season where they finished fourth, remaining undefeated at home for the entire campaign, winning games against all the big sides including Juventus, Inter, Milan, Roma, Lazio, Fiorentina, Napoli, as well as their local rivals Sampdoria who won the title that season.
Subsequently, the club gained entry to the UEFA Cup in the 1991–92 season. Genoa had a good run, making it to the semi-finals before being knocked out by Ajax, that season's winners of the competition; notably Genoa did the double over Liverpool in the quarter-finals, becoming the first Italian side to beat the "Reds" at Anfield. Unfortunately for Genoa, this success was soon followed by a 'Dark Age' following the departure of Osvaldo Bagnoli (who chose to move away from Genoa to spend more time with his daughter, whose health was rapidly declining) and the failure of the management to replace key players as they grew old or were ceded to other teams. Noted Genoa players during this period included Gianluca Signorini, Carlos Aguilera, Stefano Eranio, Roberto Onorati and John van 't Schip.&lt;br&gt;
It has to be said that chairman Spinelli had a very different management approach from that of most businessmen turned football club owners.
While his colleagues saw football as a marketing and public relation investment and were quite ready to siphon funds out of their main business to keep their teams afloat and replenish their player roster Spinelli saw Genoa as another business whose main aim was that of generating revenue for its owner (namely, himself) and so was more than happy to sell esteemed players for hefty revenues of which just a minimal fraction was then re-invested in the team, often for the acquisition of lesser-valued replacements or virtual unknowns. Thus he proved all-too-eager to sell Uruguayan striker Carlos Aguilera and to replace him with the markedly inferior Kazuyoshi Miura from Japanese side Yomiuri Verdy (a deal that especially pleased him since the Japanese sponsors were actually paying him to let Miura play in Serie A).&lt;br&gt;
The same season as their UEFA Cup run, they finished just one place above the relegation zone; in the seasons following Genoa remained in the lower half of the table.
During the 1994–95 season, Genoa were narrowly relegated; they finished level on points with Padova after the normal season period. This meant a relegation play-out was to be played between the two in Florence. The game was tied 1–1 at full-time and went to a penalty shoot-out. Genoa eventually lost the shoot-out 5–4. While back down in Serie B, the club had another taste of international cup success when they became the final winners of the Anglo-Italian Cup by beating Port Vale 5–2 with Gennaro Ruotolo scoring a hat-trick. Chairman Spinelli sold Genoa in 1997, moving onto other clubs (Alessandria and, then Livorno). The late 1990s and early 2000s would be the most trying time in the history of the club, with constant managerial changes, a poor financial situation and little hope of gaining promotion, outside of a decent 6th-place finish in 1999–00. From 1997 until 2003, Genoa had a total of three different owners and four different chairmen, before the club was passed on to the toys and games tycoon from Irpinia, Enrico Preziosi, already chairman of Como, a football club he previously owned.
Recent times.
Preziosi took over in 2003, when Genoa should have been relegated to C1 series after a dismal season, but was instead "saved" along with Catania and Salernitana by the football federation's controversial decision to extend Serie B to 24 teams. Things started to look up for Genoa; they won Serie B in 2004–05. However, allegations were raised that the club had fixed a match on the last day of the season between themselves and Venezia. The 3–2 victory in the match saw Genoa win the league, with a draw having been good enough to maintain its position in the end. The Disciplinary Committee of FIGC saw fit to instead place Genoa bottom of the league and relegate them down to Serie C1 with a three-point deduction on 27 July 2005.
For their season in Serie C1 for 2005–06, Genoa were hit with a six-point penalty from the previous season. After leading for much of the season, they eventually finished as runners-up and were entered into the play-offs, beating Monza 2–1 on aggregate to achieve promotion back into Serie B. During the summer break Gian Piero Gasperini was brought in as the new manager, he helped the club to gain promotion during the 2006–07 season, it was ensured on the last day of the season where they drew a 0–0 with Napoli, both clubs were happily promoted back into Serie A.
The 2007–08 season, the first Serie A championship played by Genoa in 12 years, saw it finishing in a respectable tenth place, right after the "big ones" of Italian football.
A careful summer market session saw chairman, Preziosi strengthening the core of the team while parting from some players on favourable economical terms (for example selling striker Marco Borriello to AC Milan for a hefty sum). Genoa's aims for the 2008–09 season were set on a UEFA Cup spot. This was achieved after a strong season which saw the team finish 5th in Serie A, besting traditional powerhouses like Juventus, Roma, and Milan, and winning both Genoa derbies against Sampdoria, with Diego Milito finishing among the top scorers of the championship. Genoa subsequently lost Milito and midfielder Thiago Motta to Internazionale, but were able to bring in striker Hernán Crespo. Things however did not go as planned, with the injury-plagued team eliminated in the early stages of the Europa League and Coppa Italia and falling to a ninth-place finish in Serie A in 2010.
In the 2010–11 season, Genoa, whose ranks had been revolutionised once again save for some long-serving players, struggled along in the mid-positions of the league; a slew of questionable results early in the season led chairman Preziosi to fire trainer Gian Piero Gasperini, who had led the team since the 2007–08 season, and to select Davide Ballardini as his successor. The newcomers, despite not securing memorable successes, kept the team steadily afloat in the "left part" of the ranking, managing to win two consecutive derby matches against rivals Sampdoria in December and May.
The 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons saw Genoa place in 17th both times, one spot away from relegation to Serie B.
In the 2014–15 season, Genoa, in sixth place and set to qualify for the UEFA Europa League qualifying round, were denied a UEFA license because they filed paperwork late and because the Stadio Luigi Ferraris was not currently up to standard for UEFA competition. The spot was passed on to 7th placed Sampdoria.
This damaged Genoa's momentum, and Genoa coasted to an 11th-place finish in the 2015–16 season. In 2016–17, Genoa avoided relegation in 16th-place, and once again finished mid-table in the 2017–18 season. In the 2018–19 season, Genoa mathematically avoided relegation from Serie A. They were tied on 38 points with Empoli, but Empoli went down due to Genoa's superior head-to-head record.
In the 2021–22 season, Genoa finished 19th in the league table to be relegated after fifteen years in top division. In the 2022–23 season, the club finished second in Serie B, to promote back to Serie A after one season.

Chairmen history.
Below is the chairmen ( or ) history of Genoa, from when the club was first founded playing cricket and athletics, until the present day.
Managerial history.
Genoa have had many managers and trainers, some seasons they have had co-managers running the team, here is a chronological list of them from 1896 when they became a football club, onwards.
Colours, badge and nicknames.
As Genoa was a British-run club, the first ever colours were those of the England national football team. Not long into the club's footballing history, the kit was changed to white and blue stripes in 1899; the blue was chosen to represent the sea as Genoa is a port city. In 1901 the club finally settled for their most famous red and blue halves shirt, this gained them the nickname of "rossoblù" together with Bologna, Cagliari and many more minor clubs.
One of the nicknames of Genoa is "Il Grifone "which means "the griffin"; this is derived from the coat of arms belonging to the city of Genoa. The coat of arms features two golden griffins, either side of the Saint George's Cross. As well as being present on both the flag and coat of arms of the city of Genoa, the cross is evocative of the club's English founders. St. George was also the patron saint of the former Republic of Genoa. The actual club badge of "Genoa Cricket and Football Club" is heavily derived from the city coat of arms, but also incorporated the club's red and blue colours.
Supporters and rivalries.
Genoa CFC has the bulk of its fans in Liguria, however they are also popular in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley. The seafaring traditions of the Genoese and the presence of Genoese communities in distant countries did much to spread the appeal of Genoa some further than just Italy, and immigrants founded fan clubs in Buenos Aires, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Toronto, New York, San Francisco, Barcelona, Iceland and other places.
The most significant and traditional rivalry for Genoa, is the inner-city one with the club with whom they share a ground; Sampdoria. The two clubs compete together in the heated "Derby della Lanterna" ("Derby of the Lantern"); a reference to the Lighthouse of Genoa. Genoa's supporters also have a strong distaste for AC Milan. A clash between opposing supporters in January 1995 resulted in the death of Genoese Vincenzo Spagnolo, who was stabbed to death by Milanese Simone Barbaglia. The assailant was a member of an informal group of football hooligans dubbed "The Barbour Ones", who used to routinely carry bladed weapons to matches, a practice made possible by the lax security measures of the time.
Conversely, the fans of Genoa have long standing friendships with Napoli (which goes back to the 1982 last match of the season). On the last day of the 2006–07 season, Genoa and Napoli drew a practical 0–0 ensuring both were promoted back into Serie A; Genoa ultras could be seen holding up banners saying "Benvenuto fratello napoletano", meaning, "Welcome, Neapolitan brother," and the two sets of fans celebrated together in a warm and ever-co-operating manner.
On the other hand, the amicable relationship with the red-and-yellow supporters of Roma, fostered by the cession of striker Roberto Pruzzo in 1979 and lasting for most of the 80's has, in recent years, cooled up a bit while another strong fraternity, which saw Genoese football fans on friendly terms with Torino (since the exchange of Gigi Meroni between the two clubs at the end of the 1963–64 season and his untimely death on 15 October 1967) has perhaps broken-down for good after the Torino-Genoa match of season 2008–09.
Starved for points and risking a humiliating relegation (one of many in a troubled recent history) the Turinese fans expected a "friendly" treatment from Genoa, which, in the heat of a pitched battle with Fiorentina for the fourth place (which could have won a Champions League spot for the team) did not comply, soundly beating Torino and to many effects sealing its fate. When during early August 2009 Genoa scheduled a friendly match with Nice in southern Piedmont, many Turinese hooligans travelled to the match location with the precise intention of starting trouble and disorder to "get even" with Genoa and its fans.
Ownership and structure.
777 Partners.
On 23 September 2021, it was announced that Genoa had been acquired by 777 Partners, a US-based private investment firm founded by Steven W. Pasko and Josh Wander. While terms were not publicly released, sources close to the deal revealed that the team was acquired for its enterprise value of $175 million. Despite being relegated to Serie B in their very first season under 777 Partners ownership, Genoa immediately made it back to Serie A the following year.
Cricket.
Early on, the club transformed from a multi-sport club to one exclusively focused on football. In 2007, a group of club supporters formed a section dedicated to cricket. It currently competes under the name Genoa Cricket Club 1893 in Serie A of the Italian cricket league.

ACF Fiorentina, commonly referred to as Fiorentina (), is an Italian professional football club based in Florence, Tuscany. The original team was founded by a merger in August 1926, while the current club was refounded in August 2002 following bankruptcy. Fiorentina have always played at the top level of Italian football but six seasons, since Serie A was created; only four clubs have played in more Serie A seasons.
Fiorentina has won two Italian league titles, in 1955–56 and again in 1968–69, as well as six Coppa Italia trophies and one Supercoppa Italiana. On the European stage, Fiorentina won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1960–61 and lost the final one year later. They finished runners-up in the 1956–57 European Cup (the first Italian team to reach the final in the top continental competition), the 1989–90 UEFA Cup and the 2022–23 UEFA Europa Conference League.
Fiorentina is one of fifteen European teams that have played in the finals of all three major continental competitions (the European Cup/Champions League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Cup/Europa League) and in 2023, by reaching the UEFA Europa Conference League final, Fiorentina became the first team to reach all four major European club competition finals (excluding the one-off match of the UEFA Super Cup).
Since 1931, the club have played at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, which currently has a capacity of 43,147. The stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations. Fiorentina are known widely by the nickname "Viola", a reference to their distinctive purple colours.
History.
Foundation prior to World War II.
Associazione Calcio Fiorentina was founded in the autumn of 1926 by local noble and National Fascist Party member Luigi Ridolfi Vay da Verrazzano, who initiated the merger of two older Florentine clubs, CS Firenze and PG Libertas. The aim of the merger was to give Florence a strong club to rival those of the more dominant Italian Football Championship sides of the time from Northwest Italy. Also influential was the cultural revival and rediscovery of , an ancestor of modern football that was played by members of the family.
After a rough start and three seasons in lower leagues, Fiorentina reached the in 1931. That same year saw the opening of the new stadium, originally named after Giovanni Berta, a prominent fascist, but now known as Stadio Artemio Franchi. At the time, the stadium was a masterpiece of engineering, and its inauguration was monumental. To be able to compete with the best teams in Italy, Fiorentina strengthened their team with some new players, notably the Uruguayan Pedro Petrone, nicknamed "el Artillero". Despite enjoying a good season and finishing in fourth place, Fiorentina were relegated the following year, although they would return quickly to . In 1941, they won their first Coppa Italia, but the team were unable to build on their success during the 1940s due to World War II and other troubles.
First "scudetto" and '50–'60s.
In 1950, Fiorentina started to achieve consistent top-five finishes in the domestic league. The team consisted of players such as well-known goalkeeper Giuliano Sarti, Sergio Cervato, Francesco Rosella, Guido Gratton, Giuseppe Chiappella, Aldo Scaramucci, Brazilian Julinho, and Argentinian Miguel Montuori. This team won Fiorentina's first "scudetto" (Italian championship) in 1955–56, 12 points ahead of second-place Milan. Milan beat Fiorentina to top spot the following year. Fiorentina became the first Italian team to play in a European Cup final, when a disputed penalty led to a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Alfredo Di Stéfano's Real Madrid.
Fiorentina were runners-up again in the three subsequent seasons. In the 1960–61 season, the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe, winning the first Cup Winners' Cup against Scottish side Rangers.
After several years of runner-up finishes, Fiorentina dropped away slightly in the 1960s, bouncing from fourth to sixth place, although the club won the Coppa Italia and the Mitropa Cup in 1966.
Second "scudetto" and '70s.
While the 1960s did result in some trophies and good Serie A finishes for Fiorentina, nobody believed that the club could challenge for the title. The 1968–69 season started with Milan as frontrunners, but on matchday 7, they lost to Bologna and were overtaken by Gigi Riva's Cagliari. Fiorentina, after an unimpressive start, then moved to the top of the Serie A, but the first half of their season finished with a 2–2 draw against Varese, leaving Cagliari as outright league leader. The second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams, Milan, Cagliari and Fiorentina. Milan fell away, instead focusing their efforts on the European Cup, and it seemed that Cagliari would retain top spot. After Cagliari lost against , however, Fiorentina took over at the top. The team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals Juve in Turin on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. In the European Cup competition the following year, Fiorentina had some good results, including a win in the Soviet Union against , but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals after a 3–0 defeat in Glasgow to Celtic.
"Viola" players began the 1970s decade with "scudetto" sewed on their breast, but the period was not especially fruitful for the team. After a fifth-place finish in 1971, they finished in mid-table almost every year, even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978. The "Viola" did win the Anglo-Italian League Cup in 1974 and won the Coppa Italia again in 1975. The team consisted of young talents like Vincenzo Guerini and Moreno Roggi, who suffered bad injuries, and above all Giancarlo Antognoni, who would later become an idol to Fiorentina's fans. The young average age of the players led to the team being called "Fiorentina Ye-Ye".
Pontello era.
In 1980, Fiorentina was bought by Flavio Pontello, who came from a rich house-building family. He quickly changed the team's anthem and logo, leading to some complaints by the fans, but he started to bring in high-quality players such as Francesco Graziani and Eraldo Pecci from Torino; Daniel Bertoni from Sevilla; Daniele Massaro from Monza; and a young Pietro Vierchowod from Como. The team was built around Giancarlo Antognoni, and in 1982, Fiorentina were involved in an exciting duel with rivals Juventus. After a bad injury to Antognoni, the league title was decided on the final day of the season when Fiorentina were denied a goal against Cagliari and were unable to win. Juventus won the title with a disputed penalty and the rivalry between the two teams erupted.
The following years were strange for Fiorentina, who vacillated between high finishes and relegation battles. Fiorentina also bought two interesting players, "El Puntero" Ramón Díaz and, most significantly, the young Roberto Baggio.
In 1990, Fiorentina fought to avoid relegation right up until the final day of the season, but did reach the UEFA Cup final, where they again faced Juventus. The Turin team won the trophy, but Fiorentina's "tifosi" once again had real cause for complaint: the second leg of the final was played in Avellino (Fiorentina's home ground was suspended), a city with many Juventus fans, and emerging star Roberto Baggio was sold to the rival team on the day of the final. Pontello, suffering from economic difficulties, was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in Florence's streets. The club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker Mario Cecchi Gori.
Cecchi Gori era: from Champions League to bankruptcy.
The first season under Cecchi Gori's ownership was one of stabilisation, after which the new chairman started to sign some good players like Brian Laudrup, Stefan Effenberg, Francesco Baiano and, most importantly, Gabriel Batistuta, who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s. In 1993, however, Cecchi Gori died and was succeeded as chairman by his son, Vittorio. Despite a good start to the season, Cecchi Gori fired the coach, Luigi Radice, after a defeat against Atalanta, and replaced him with Aldo Agroppi. The results were dreadful: Fiorentina fell into the bottom half of the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season.
Claudio Ranieri was brought in as coach for the 1993–94 season, and that year, Fiorentina dominated Serie B, Italy's second division. Upon their return to Serie A, Ranieri put together a good team centred around new top scorer Batistuta, signing the young talent Rui Costa from Benfica and the new world champion Brazilian defender Márcio Santos. The former became an idol to Fiorentina fans, while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season. The "Viola" finished the season in tenth place.
The following season, Cecchi Gori bought other important players, namely Swedish midfielder Stefan Schwarz. The club again proved its mettle in cup competitions, winning the Coppa Italia against Atalanta and finishing joint-third in Serie A. In the summer, Fiorentina became the first non-national champions to win the Supercoppa Italiana, defeating Milan 2–1 at the San Siro.
Fiorentina's 1996–97 season was disappointing in the league, but they did reach the Cup Winners' Cup semi-final by beating Gloria Bistrița, Sparta Prague and Benfica. The team lost the semi-final to the eventual winner of the competition, Barcelona (away 1–1; home 0–2). The season's main signings were Luís Oliveira and Andrei Kanchelskis, the latter of whom suffered from many injuries.
At the end of the season, Ranieri left Fiorentina for Valencia in Spain, with Cecchi Gori appointing Alberto Malesani as his replacement. Fiorentina played well but struggled against smaller teams, although they did manage to qualify for the UEFA Cup. Malesani left Fiorentina after only a season and was succeeded by Giovanni Trapattoni. With Trapattoni's expert guidance and Batistuta's goals, Fiorentina challenged for the title in 1998–99 but finished the season in third, earning them qualification for the Champions League. The following year was disappointing in Serie A, but "Viola" played some historical matches in the Champions League, beating Arsenal 1–0 at the old Wembley Stadium and Manchester United 2–0 in Florence. They were ultimately eliminated in the second group stage.
At the end of the season, Trapattoni left the club and was replaced by Turkish coach Fatih Terim. More significantly, however, Batistuta was sold to Roma, who eventually won the title the following year. Fiorentina played well in 2000–01 and stayed in the top half of Serie A, despite the resignation of Terim and the arrival of Roberto Mancini. They also won the Coppa Italia for the sixth and last time.
The year 2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina, as the terrible state of the club's finances was revealed: they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around US$50 million. The club's owner, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, was able to raise some more money, but this soon proved to be insufficient to sustain the club. Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the 2001–02 season, and went into judicially-controlled administration in June 2002. This form of bankruptcy (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the 2002–03 season, and as a result effectively ceased to exist.
Della Valle era: from fourth tier to Europe (2000s and 2010s).
The club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Florentia Viola with shoe and leather entrepreneur Diego Della Valle as new owner and the club was admitted into Serie C2, the fourth tier of Italian football. The only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was Angelo Di Livio, whose commitment to the club's cause further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di Livio and 30-goal striker Christian Riganò, the club won its Serie C2 group with considerable ease, which would normally have led to a promotion to Serie C1. Due to the bizarre "Caso Catania" (Catania Case), the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into Serie B, something that was only made possible by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC)'s decision to resolve the Catania situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24 and promoting Fiorentina for "sports merits". In the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as ACF Fiorentina. The club finished the 2003–04 season in sixth place and won the playoff against Perugia to return to top-flight football.
In their first season back in Serie A, the club struggled to avoid relegation, only securing survival on the last day of the season on head-to-head record against Bologna and Parma. In 2005, Della Valle decided to appoint Pantaleo Corvino as new sports director, followed by the appointment of Cesare Prandelli as head coach in the following season. The club made several signings during the summer transfer market, most notably Luca Toni and Sébastien Frey. This drastic move earned them a fourth-place finish with 74 points and a Champions League qualifying round ticket. Toni scored 31 goals in 38 appearances, the first player to pass the 30-goal mark since Antonio Valentin Angelillo in the 1958–59 season, for which he was awarded the European Golden Boot. On 14 July 2006, Fiorentina were relegated to Serie B due to their involvement in the "Calciopoli" scandal and given a 12-point penalty. The team was reinstated to the Serie A on appeal, but with a 19-point penalty for the 2006–07 season. The team's 2006–07 Champions League place was also revoked. After the start of the season, Fiorentina's penalisation was reduced from 19 points to 15 on appeal to the Italian courts. In spite of this penalty, they managed to secure a place in the UEFA Cup.
Despite Toni's departure to Bayern Munich, Fiorentina had a strong start to the 2007–08 season and were tipped by Italy national team head coach Marcello Lippi, among others, as a surprise challenger for the "scudetto", and although this form tailed off towards the middle of the season, the "Viola" managed to qualify for the Champions League. In Europe, the club reached the semi-final of the UEFA Cup, where they were ultimately defeated by Rangers on penalties. The 2008–09 season continued this success, a fourth-place finish assuring Fiorentina's spot in 2010's Champions League playoffs. Their European campaign was also similar to that of the previous run, relegated to the 2008–09 UEFA Cup and were eliminated by Ajax in the end.
In the 2009–10 season, Fiorentina started their domestic campaign strongly before steadily losing momentum and slipped to mid-table positions at the latter half of the season. In Europe, the team proved to be a surprise dark horse: after losing their first away fixture against Lyon, they staged a comeback with a five-match streak by winning all their remaining matches (including defeating Liverpool home and away). The "Viola" qualified as group champions, but eventually succumbed to Bayern Munich due to the away goals rule. This was controversial due to a mistaken refereeing decision by Tom Henning Øvrebø, who allowed a clearly offside goal for Bayern in the first leg. Bayern eventually finished the tournament as runners-up, making a deep run all the way to the final. The incident called into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football. Despite a good European run and reaching the semi-finals in the Coppa Italia, Fiorentina failed to qualify for Europe.
During this period, on 24 September 2009, Andrea Della Valle resigned from his position as chairman of Fiorentina, and announced all duties would be temporarily transferred to Mario Cognini, Fiorentina's vice-president until a permanent position could be filled.
In June 2010, the "Viola" bid farewell to long-time manager Cesare Prandelli, by then the longest-serving coach in the team's history, who was departing to coach the Italy national team. Catania manager Siniša Mihajlović was appointed to replace him. The club spent much of the early 2010–11 season in last place, but their form improved and Fiorentina ultimately finished ninth. Following a 1–0 defeat to Chievo in November 2011, Mihajlović was sacked and replaced by Delio Rossi. After a brief period of improvements, the "Viola" were again fighting relegation, prompting the sacking of Sporting Director Pantaleo Corvino in early 2012 following a 0–5 home defeat to Juventus. Their bid for survival was kept alive by a number of upset victories away from home, notably at Roma and Milan. During a home game against Novara, trailing 0–2 within half an hour, manager Rossi decided to substitute midfielder Adem Ljajić early. Ljajić sarcastically applauded him in frustration, whereupon Rossi retaliated by physical assaulting his player, an action that ultimately prompted his termination by the club. His replacement, caretaker manager Vincenzo Guerini, then guided the team away from the relegation zone to a 13th-place finish to end the turbulent year.
To engineer a resurrection of the club after the disappointing season, the Della Valle family invested heavily in the middle of 2012, buying 17 new players and appointing Vincenzo Montella as head coach. The team began the season well, finishing the calendar year in joint third place and eventually finishing the 2012–13 season in fourth, enough for a position in the 2013–14 Europa League.
The club lost fan favourite Stevan Jovetić during the middle of 2013, selling him to English Premier League club Manchester City for a €30 million transfer fee. They also sold Adem Ljajić to Roma and Alessio Cerci to Torino, using the funds to bring in Mario Gómez, Josip Iličić and Ante Rebić, among others. During the season, Fiorentina topped their Europa League group, moving on to the round of 32 to face Danish side Esbjerg fB, which Fiorentina defeated 4–2 on aggregate. In the following round of 16, however, they then lost to Italian rivals Juventus 2–1 on aggregate, ousting Fiorentina from the competition. At the end of the season, the team finished fourth again in the league, and also finishing the year as Coppa Italia runners-up after losing 3–1 to Napoli in the final.
In 2014–15, during the 2015 winter transfer window, the team club sold star winger Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea for €30 million but were able to secure the loan of Mohamed Salah in exchange, who was a revelation in the second half of the season. Their 2014–15 Europa League campaign saw them progress to the semi-finals, where they were knocked-out by Spanish side Sevilla, the eventual champions. In the 2014–15 domestic season, Fiorentina once again finished fourth, thus qualifying for the 2015–16 Europa League. In June 2015, Vincenzo Montella was sacked as manager after the club grew impatient with the coaches inability to prove his commitment to the club, and was replaced by Paulo Sousa, who lasted until June 2017 and the appointment of Stefano Pioli. Club captain Davide Astori died suddenly at the age of 31 in March 2018. Astori had suffered a cardiac arrest while in a hotel room before an away game. The club subsequently retired Astori's kit number, 13. Fiorentina suffered during the 2018–19 Serie A campaign and ended the season on a 14 match winless streak, finishing in 16th place with only 41 points, 3 points from the relegation zone. On 9 April 2019, Pioli resigned as manager and was replaced by Montella.
Commisso era.
On 6 June 2019, the club was sold to Italian-American billionaire Rocco Commisso for around 160 million euros. The sale marked the end of the Della Valle family's seventeen-year association with the club. Vincenzo Montella was confirmed as coach for the first season of the new era despite the team's poor end to the previous campaign, which saw them finish only three points clear of the relegation zone. Fiorentina continued their struggles from the previous year, spending the majority of the season in lower midtable. Montella was sacked on 21 December after a 7 match winless run which left the club in 15th place, and was replaced by Giuseppe Iachini.
In November 2020 Cesare Prandelli returned to Fiorentina, replacing Giuseppe Iachini as coach.

Managerial history.
Fiorentina have had many managers and head coaches throughout their history. Below is a chronological list from the club's foundation in 1926 to the present day.
Colours and badge.
Badge.
The official emblem of the city of Florence, a red fleur-de-lis on a white field, has been pivotal in the all-round symbolism of the club.
Over the course of the club's history, they have had several badge changes, all of which incorporated Florence's fleur-de-lis in some way. The first one was nothing more than the city's coat of arms, a white shield with the red fleur-de-lis inside. It was soon changed to a very stylised fleur-de-lis, always red, and sometimes even without the white field. The most common symbol, adopted for about 20 years, had been a white lozenge with the flower inside. During the season they were Italian champions, the lozenge disappeared and the flower was overlapped with the "scudetto".
The logo introduced by owner Flavio Pontello in 1980 was particularly distinct, consisting of one-half of the city of Florence's emblem and one-half of the letter "F", for Fiorentina. People disliked it when it was introduced, believing it was a commercial decision and, above all, because the symbol bore more of a resemblance to a halberd than a fleur-de-lis.
Until the 2022–23 season, when the club unveiled a new, stylistically simplified badge, the logo was a kite shaped double lozenge bordered in gold. The outer lozenge had a purple background with the letters "AC" in white and the letter "F" in red, standing for the club's name. The inner lozenge was white with a gold border and the red Giglio of Florence. This logo had been in use from 1992 to 2002, but after the financial crisis and resurrection of the club the new one couldn't use the same logo. Florence's "comune" instead granted Florentia Viola use of the stylised coat of arms used in other city documents. Diego Della Valle acquired the current logo the following year in a judicial auction for a fee of €2.5 million, making it the most expensive logo in Italian football.
Kit and colours.
When Fiorentina was founded in 1926, the players wore red and white halved shirts derived from the colour of the city emblem. The more well-known and highly distinctive purple kit was adopted in 1928 and has been used ever since, giving rise to the nickname "La Viola" ("The Purple (team)"). Tradition has it that Fiorentina got their purple kit by mistake after an accident washing the old red and white coloured kits in the river.
The away kit has always been predominantly white, sometimes with purple and red elements, sometimes all-white. The shorts had been purple when the home kit was with white shorts. Fiorentina's third kit was first worn in the 1995–96 season and it was all-red with purple borders and two lilies on the shoulders. The red shirt has been the most worn 3rd shirt by Fiorentina, although they also wore rare yellow shirts ('97–'98, '99–'00 and '10–'11) and a sterling version, mostly in the Coppa Italia, in 2000–01.
For the 2017–18 season and the first time in its history, the club used five kits during the season, composing of one home kit (all-purple) and four away kits, each one representing one historic quartiere of the city of Florence: all-blue (Santa Croce), all-white (Santo Spirito), all-green (San Giovanni) and all-red (Santa Maria Novella).
Anthem.
"Canzone Viola" (Purple Song) is the title of the Fiorentina'a song, nowadays better known as "Oh Fiorentina". It is the oldest official football anthem in Italy and one of the oldest in the world. Dated 1930 and born only four years after the creation of the club, the song was written by a 12-year-old child, Enzo Marcacci, and musically arranged by maestro Marco Vinicio. It was published for the first time by the publisher Marcello Manni, who later became the owner of the rights. It soon achieved notoriety thanks to the printed media and the Ordine del Marzocco, a sort of original viola-club, which printed the lyrics of the song and distributed it to a home match on November 22, 1931.
The song was recorded by Narciso Parigi in 1959 and again in 1965; the latter version replaced the original edition as the Fiorentina anthem. Subsequently, Narciso Parigi himself acquired the ownership of the rights, which he donated in 2002 to the supporter club Collettivo Autonomo Viola.
Fiorentina as a company.
A.C. Fiorentina S.p.A. was unable to register for 2002–03 Serie B due to financial difficulties, and then the sports title was transferred to a new company thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., while the old company was liquidated. At that time the club was heavily relying on windfall profit from selling players, especially in pure player swap or cash plus player swap that potentially increased the cost by the increase in amortisation of player contracts (an intangible assets). For example, Marco Rossi joined Fiorentina for Lire 17 billion in 2000, but at the same time Lorenzo Collacchioni moved to Salernitana for Lire 1 billion, meaning the club had a player profit of Lire 997 million and extra Lire 1 billion to be amortised in 5-years. In 1999, Emiliano Bigica also swapped with Giuseppe Taglialatela, which the latter was valued for Lire 10 billion. The operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading) of 2000–01 season was minus Lire 113,271,475,933 (minus €58,499,835). It was only boosted by the sales of Francesco Toldo and Rui Costa in June 2001 (a profit of Lire 134.883 billion; €69.661 million). However, it was alleged they were to transfer to Parma for a reported Lire 140 million. The two players eventually joined Inter Milan and A.C. Milan in 2001–02 financial year instead, for undisclosed fees. Failing to have financial support from the owner Vittorio Cecchi Gori, the club was forced to windup due to its huge imbalance in operating income.
Since re-established in 2002, ACF Fiorentina S.p.A. are yet to self-sustain to keep the team in top division as well as in European competitions. In the 2005 financial year, which cover the first Serie A season, the club made a net loss of €9,159,356, followed by a net loss of €19,519,789. In 2006 (2005–06 Serie A and 2006–07 Serie A), Fiorentina heavily invested on players, meaning the amortisation of intangible asset (the player contract) had increased from €17.7 million to €24 million. However the club suffered from the 2006 Italian football scandal, which meant the club did not qualify for Europe. In 2007 Fiorentina almost broke-even, with a net loss of just €3,704,953. In the 2007 financial year the TV revenue increased after they qualified to the 2007–08 UEFA Cup. Despite qualifying to the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League, Fiorentina made a net loss of €9,179,484 in 2008 financial year after the increase in TV revenue was outweighed by the increase in wage. In the 2009 financial year, Fiorentina made a net profit of €4,442,803, largely due to the profit on selling players (€33,631,489 from players such as Felipe Melo, Giampaolo Pazzini and Zdravko Kuzmanović; increased from about €3.5 million in 2008). However it was also offset by the write-down of selling players (€6,062,545, from players such as Manuel da Costa, Arturo Lupoli and Davide Carcuro).
After the club failed to qualify to Europe at the end of 2009–10 Serie A, as well as lack of player profit, Fiorentina turnover was decreased from €140,040,713 in 2009 to just €79,854,928, despite the wage bill also falling, "la Viola" still made a net loss of €9,604,353. In the 2011 financial year, the turnover slipped to €67,076,953, as the club's lack of capital gains from selling players and 2010 financial year still included the instalments from UEFA for participating 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. Furthermore, the gate income had dropped from €11,070,385 to €7,541,260. The wage bill did not fall much and in reverse the amortisation of transfer fee had sightly increased due to new signings. "La Viola" had savings in other costs but counter-weighted by huge €11,747,668 write-down for departed players, due to D'Agostino, Frey and Mutu, but the former would counter-weight by co-ownership financial income, which all made the operating cost remained high as worse as last year. Moreover, in 2010 the result was boosted by acquiring the asset from subsidiary (related to AC Fiorentina) and the re-valuation of its value in separate balance sheet. If deducting that income (€14,737,855), 2010 financial year was net loss 24,342,208 and 2011 result was worse with €8,131,876 only in separate balance sheet. In 2012, the club benefited from the sales of Matija Nastasić and Valon Behrami, followed by Stevan Jovetić and Adem Ljajić in 2013. In 2014, due to €28.4 million drop from the windfall profit of selling players, the club recorded their worst financial results since re-foundation, despite the fact the club maintained the same level of windfall profit, the result was still worse than in 2013. Moreover, Fiorentina also revealed that the club had a relevant football net income of minus €19.5 million in the first assessment period of UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations in the 2013–14 season (in May 2014). (aggregate of 2012 and 2013 results), which within the limit of minus €45 million, as well as minus €25.5 million in assessment period 2014–15 (aggregate of 2012, 2013 and 2014 results). However, as the limit was reduced to minus €30 million in assessment period 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 season, the club had to achieve a relevant net income of positive €5.6 million in 2015 financial year. "La Viola" sold Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea in January 2015 for €30 million fee, to make the club eligible for the 2016–17 edition of UEFA competitions.

Italian football club
Football club
Lucchese 1905 s.r.l., or simply Lucchese, is an Italian football club, based in Lucca, Tuscany that plays in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football. The club was first founded in 1905, having last been in Serie A in 1952.
History.
Foundation.
The club was founded on 25 May 1905, giving the town of Lucca its first football team. Originally named Lucca Football Club the club was founded by the Vittorio brothers and Guido Mensini. The first large achievement by the club was winning the "Goblet of the King" during the 1919–20 season, not long after the tournament's foundation. The same season Lucca won the Regional cup of Tuscany.
From U.S. Lucchese-Libertas to A.S. Lucchese Libertas.
U.S. Lucchese-Libertas.
In 1924 the club merged with another local team and changed its name to Unione Sportiva Lucchese-Libertas. During the 1920s, notable players at the club included Ernesto Bonino and Giovanni Moscardini.
The 1930s saw the club promoted to Serie B, and then in 1936, Lucchese won promotion to Serie A, the top league in Italy, where they stayed for three seasons. The club were relegated back to Serie B as World War II started. Prior to the war, players such as Egri Erbstein, Aldo Olivieri and Antonio Perduca were fan's favorites. Lucchese won promotion again to Serie A in 1947 and remained there for 5 seasons.
A.S. Lucchese Libertas.
In 1984 the club changed its name to A.S. Lucchese Libertas.
The club spent also several seasons in Serie B (last 1998–99) and Serie C1, being also coached by Luigi Simoni, UEFA Cup-winning coach with Inter Milan.
In 2008 the club folded due to serious financial issues and was admitted in the Italian bottom (amateur) division Terza Categoria before being declared formally bankrupt in December 2008.
From S.S.D. Sporting Lucchese to A.S. Lucchese Libertas 1905.
S.S.D. Sporting Lucchese.
A new re-born team called Società Sportiva Dilettantistica Sporting Lucchese was admitted to Serie D to represent the city of Lucca.
In its first season of existence, Sporting Lucchese promptly won the "Girone E" round of Serie D, thus acquiring the right to take part to the 2009–10 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.
A.S. Lucchese Libertas 1905.
After the promotion, the new club took the denomination of Associazione Sportiva Lucchese Libertas 1905 starting with the new season, after the Sporting Lucchese owner acquired the naming and logo rights of the old, original team in a public auction. Lucchese made a second consecutive promotion after finishing as champions of Group B of Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. The club has spent the 2010–11 season in Lega Pro Prima Divisione.
However, in the summer of 2011, Lucchese was excluded from professional football by COVISOC for financial irregularity reasons, and didn't appeal against the decision.
From A.S.D. F.C. Lucca 2011 to A.S. Lucchese Libertas 1905.
On 1 August 2011, a new club was founded to represent the city of Lucca: the team was called Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Football Club Lucca 2011 and in it was promoted from Eccellenza Tuscany to Serie D at the end of the 2011–12 season.
The club changed its name to F.C. Lucchese 1905 soon after being promoted.
In the summer 2013 the club changed his name back to A.S. Lucchese Libertas 1905. On that same season, Lucchese returned to professionalism after winning the Group D of the 2013–14 Serie D, and thus ensuring a spot in the inaugural season of the unified 2014–15 Lega Pro league.
After a struggling season in the 2018–19 Serie C that was hit by more financial issues involving the club, Lucchese failed to submit its application for the 2019–20 Serie C, and was declared bankrupt once again on 1 July 2019.
Immediately after being excluded from Serie C, a further new incarnation of the club, named as S.S.D. Lucchese 1905, was admitted by the Football Federation to Serie D.

FC Pro Vercelli 1892

Italian football club
Football club
Football Club Pro Vercelli 1892, commonly referred to as Pro Vercelli, is an Italian football club based in Vercelli, Piedmont. The club is mostly renowned as one of the most successful teams in the early football era of Italy, with seven national titles (all won between 1908 and 1922). They currently play in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football.
History.
Early league successes and decline.
The origins of football in Vercelli go back to 1892 when it was founded as Società Ginnastica Pro Vercelli ("Pro Vercelli Gymnastics Society"), and 1903 with its Football Division.
The first official match for the football division of S.G. Pro Vercelli took place on 3 August 1903 against the Forza e Costanza.
The club won seven Italian Football Championships from 1908 to 1922: 1908, 1909, 1910–11, 1911–12, 1912–13, 1920–21, and 1921–22.
The introduction of professionalism in Italian football, and the rise of teams from larger industrial and business cities such as Milan and Turin, led Pro Vercelli to a slow but continuous decline. They played Serie A for their last time to date in 1934–35, and went ultimately relegated also from the 1947–48 Serie B, starting a long period out of the two top divisions of Italian football, even being relegated to Italy's amateur league, Serie D, in multiple times. They regained professional status for good after winning promotion and the Scudetto Dilettanti in the season 1993–94.
Bankruptcy and the new Pro Vercelli.
In the early 2000s, Pro Vercelli also had to challenge crosstown rivalry from a new team, A.S. Pro Belvedere Vercelli (with the colours yellow and green), founded in the summer of 2006 as a merger between "A.S. Trino Calcio" (based in Trino, Piedmont), who played in Serie D and minor league team "P.G.S. Pro Belvedere", founded in 1912.
In the 2006–07 Serie D, the team finished 9th in Girone A. A year later, in the Serie D 2007–08 season, the team finished 3rd in the same division, qualifying for the Serie D play-offs. It won its way to the group stage of the tournament, but failed qualify as one of the top 5 teams of the play-offs, all of which were later promoted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.
In the 2008–09 Serie D, Pro Belvedere finished first in Girone B, winning direct promotion to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. Their debut season into professional football also featured, for the first time in the club's history, a crosstown derby with Pro Vercelli, but was not particularly successful, with the team lying in second-last place for most of the time in the 2009–10 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, and promotion winning coach Luca Prina being replaced by the more experienced Gianfranco Motta.
Pro Belvedere were relegated after only one season but re-admitted to fill a number of vacancies in the league; at the same time, due to large debts, Pro Vercelli was not allowed to participate in the 2010–11 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione and so folded. In order to keep the old Pro Vercelli alive, Pro Belvedere changed its name to U.S. Vercelli Calcio and weeks later acquired honours and trademarks from the old Pro Vercelli, being thus allowed to switch its denomination to the current one, as well as to maintain the historical names and colours of the original team.
In the season 2010–11 the team played in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione ranking 3rd and was eliminated from Pro Patria in the semi-final of the play-off, but on 4 August 2011 it was later admitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione to fill vacancies.
New successes: back to Serie B after 64 years.
In the season 2011–12 of Lego Pro Prima Divisione the club was promoted to Serie B after 64 years, beating Carpi 3–1 in the final return of the play-off after the 0–0 of the first round.
The club had a very unsuccessful return to Serie B, finishing 21st of 22 teams and with a goal difference −30, the worst in the league. Their placing in the league meant that they were relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione.
In 2013–14 season, Girone A of Lega Pro 1, Pro Vercelli missed out on an immediate automatic promotion back to Serie B by a single point, finishing second in the league to Virtus Entella and eight points above third placed Südtirol. Striker Ettore Marchi starred throughout the season, scoring 15 goals. In the promotion play-offs, Pro Vercelli eliminated FeralpiSalò, Savona and ultimately defeated Südtirol in the final, thus returning to Serie B after only one season away. Pro Vercelli finished 16th in Serie B in the 2014–15 season and 17th in the 2015–16 season. They were again relegated to Serie C after the 2017–18 season. On 11 July 2019, former Italian international striker Alberto Gilardino took the job as head coach.

US Salernitana 1919

Italian association football club
Football club
Unione Sportiva Salernitana 1919, commonly referred to as Salernitana, is an Italian professional football club based in Salerno, Campania. The original club was founded in 1919 and has been reconstituted three times in the course of its history, most recently in 2011. The current club is the heir of the former "Salernitana Calcio 1919", and it restarted from Serie D in the 2011–12 season. Salernitana returned to Serie A in 2021, after a break of 23 seasons, having finished second in Serie B.
History.
From Unione Sportiva Salernitana to Salernitana Calcio 1919.
The Salerno-based club was originally founded in 1919 as the "Unione Sportiva Salernitana". The club was known as "Società Sportiva Salernitanaudax" for a time during the 1920s following a merger with Audax Salerno. In 1978, the club was renamed "Salernitana Sport." The club has spent the majority of its history at the Serie B and Serie C levels of Italian football.
Salernitana play their home matches at Stadio Arechi.
In their early years, Salernitana competed in the regional Italian Football Championship for four seasons during the 1920s. After that time, the club returned to the top level of Italian football twice; they played in Serie A during 1947–48 and 1998–99.
In 2005, the club went bankrupt, but was restarted by Antonio Lombardi, changing the name from "Salernitana Sport" to "Salernitana Calcio 1919".
In 2011, the club did not appeal against a decision by "Commissione di Vigilanza sulle Società di Calcio Professionistiche" (Co.Vi.So.C) and was excluded from Italian football.
Club refoundation: from Serie D to the top flight.
On 21 July 2011, following the exclusion of the original Salernitana club, Salerno mayor Vincenzo De Luca, in compliance with Article 52 of NOIF, assigned the new title to Marco Mezzaroma, brother-in-law of Lazio owner and chairman Claudio Lotito. The new club was admitted to Serie D under the denomination of Salerno Calcio.
In the 2011–12 season, Salernitana was immediately promoted to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione after winning "Group G" of Serie D.
On 12 July 2012, the club was renamed US Salernitana 1919. In the 2012–13 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione season, Salernitana finished first in Girone B, and was promoted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione. This was the second consecutive promotion for the team. Finally Salernitana won Group C of Lega Pro and returned Serie B in 2014–15 season.
After several seasons at Serie B level, Salernitana won promotion to Serie A at the end of the 2020–21 Serie B season under the tenure of head coach Fabrizio Castori, finishing in 2nd place behind champions Empoli. Promotion was secured with a 3–0 victory over Pescara on the final matchday. Salernitana's return to Serie A, however, required Lotito and Mezzaroma to sell the club, due to Italian football laws not allowing two clubs from the same owner to play in the same league. On 7 July 2021, the FIGC Federal Council approved the trust of Salernitana to take control of the club, meaning it was officially enrolled in Serie A for the first time in 23 years.
Return to Serie A: 2021–present.
Salernitana's first match in its return to the top flight was a 3–2 defeat against Bologna on 22 August 2021. After a poor start to the season, earning only one point from the first six matches, the club picked up its first Serie A victory against Genoa on matchday seven, winning 1–0 due to a goal from Milan Đurić. In October, the Salernitana board fired Castori after a 2–1 loss to Spezia had left the club at the bottom of the table, with four points from their opening eight league games. Stefano Colantuono was named as his replacement, returning for a second spell as head coach having previously led Salernitana from December 2017 to December 2018.
On 22 May 2022, Salernitana avoided relegation by finishing with the lowest points tally in Serie A history with just 31 points. Salernitana managed to pull off the great escape by securing 18 points from their last 15 matches.
Colours, badge and nicknames.
 
Salernitana's original kit
Salernitana originally wore light blue and white striped shirts, known in Italy as "biancocelesti". The blue on the shirt was chosen to represent the sea, as Salerno lies right next to the Gulf of Salerno and has a long tradition as a port city. In the 1940s, the club changed to garnet-coloured shirts, which has gained them the nickname "granata" in their homeland.
During the 2011–12 season their kit colours were striped blue and deep red, resembling FC Barcelona. The symbol of St. Matthew, patron saint of Salerno, was also a part of the redesigned kit.
Since renaming the club US Salernitana 1919, however, their home colours have again been the traditional garnet.
The 100th anniversary logo was announced on 24 June 2019, and appeared on their 2019–20 season kits.

US Alessandria Calcio 1912

Italian football club
Football club
Unione Sportiva Alessandria Calcio 1912, commonly referred to as Alessandria, is an Italian football club based in Alessandria, Piedmont. It currently plays in Serie C, the third tier of Italian football.
History.
Brief history.
Founded in 1912, Alessandria spent 13 seasons in Serie A between 1929 and 1960 and 21 in Serie B (last in 2022); it also reached one Coppa Italia final in 1936. To date, the most successful period in the team's history was between World War I and World War II, when it was, with Novara, Pro Vercelli and Casale, part of the so-called "Quadrilatero Piemontese" ("Piedmont Quadrilateral"), which forged great players and won important trophies.
The greatest player to have worn the club's characteristic and unique grey shirt is the 2 time FIFA World Cup &amp; 1 time Central European International Cup winner Giovanni Ferrari, other notabilities include FIFA World Cup &amp; Central European International Cup winners Felice Borel &amp; Luigi Bertolini, FIFA World Cup &amp; 1936 Summer Olympics winner Pietro Rava, Central European International Cup winner &amp; 1928 Summer Olympics Bronze medalist Adolfo Baloncieri &amp; UEFA European Championship winner &amp; FIFA World Cup runner-up Gianni Rivera. Other players making it the national team like Carlo Carcano also appeared for Alessandria. With the promotion in 2009 in Lega Pro Prima Divisione, the team finally left behind a long period of financial troubles and internal problems that had led the club to bankruptcy in 2003.
From 1912 to today.
First football teams in Alessandria and birth of "Football Club".
Football arrived in Alessandria in the end of 19th century; there are reports regarding a match played in which a team of Alessandria played against one from Genoa. In 1896, the "Unione Pro Sport Alessandria" was created, followed by the football teams of the athletic club "Forza e Concordia", which wore dark-grey shirts, and "Forza e Coraggio", with pearl-grey shirts. Unione Pro Sport took part in some exhibition tournaments with teams based in Turin and Genoa between 1897 and 1898; in 1897, it won the football trophy at the National Gym Competition in Genoa. On 15 March 1898, it was invited to join the constituents of FIF, then took part in the first official championship qualification round and, feeling itself penalized in favor of F.B.C. Torinese and Genoa CFC, it preferred to leave and keep on participating in tournaments organized by FGNI.
In 1908 "Forza" and "Coraggio" members decided to set up a team which could finally dispute the Italian Championship. It happened on 18 February 1912 with the foundation of "Alessandria Foot Ball Club" by Enrico Badò, Amilcare Savojardo and Alfredo Ratti, who was elected first director (chairman). The first shirts, bought from Vigor Torino, were azure, with a large vertical white stripe in the center. The team was admitted to the Promozione (second division) for the 1912–13 season, immediately gaining a promotion after a decisive match played against Vigor Torino in Novara, of which the score was 3–0. In the same year, businessman Giovanni Maino offered eleven grey shirts, similar to those worn by his famous cycling team, to Alessandria FBC.
The first national championships and post-war.
In 1913 the team recruited the English player-coach George Arthur Smith, coming from the ranks of Genoa; he proved to be a great football teacher and, thanks to him, talented players like Adolfo Baloncieri and Carlo Carcano—who, in the 1930s, coached Juventus F.C. in the "Quinquennio d'Oro" period and who became on 31 January 1915 the first Alessandria footballer wearing the national football team's jersey—soon exploded in the 1920s. Already in the 1914–15 season, the grey team in Piedmont was very good, missing for only two points the admission to the final round.
After World War I, Alessandria F.B.C. continued to improve its performances: in the 1919–20 season, it prevailed in the elimination round and then lost to Genoa in the semifinals. In November 1920, FBC merged with another Alessandria team, "US Alessandria", established in 1915, keeping the grey shirt and changing its name to "Alessandria US". At the end of the 1920–21 season, the club gained admission to the North Italy championship semifinals after a playoff in Milan against Modena F.C. On 10 July 1921, Alessandria US lost the chance to qualify for the Northern Italy final, losing to U.S. Pro Vercelli in a violent match bitterly contested by Alessandria: they chose to withdraw in protest after just an hour of play (0–4), after a serious head injury occurred in Carcano.
In subsequent years Alessandria U.S. continued to show excellent performances, but never succeeded in winning a championship, as the tournament was dominated by Pro Vercelli and Genoa, from Bologna CFC and Turinese teams.
The CONI cup, the lost championship and the Serie A tournaments.
In 1927, after a disappointing season after which the salvation from relegation in Division I came only after a series of playouts against Pisa, Legnano and Novara, came the first trophy: the Coppa CONI, won after a double final played against Casale (1–1 in Casale Monferrato and 2–1 in Alexandria). In the first round, Alessandria, which was trained by Carlo Carcano, defeated Livorno, Andrea Doria, Brescia, Alba Rome and Napoli. Later that year the works for the new stadium started. Alessandria players at the time were Giovanni Ferrari, Luigi Bertolini and Adolfo Baloncieri, which in the summer of 1927 signed for Torino F.C..
In 1928 Alessandria came close to winning the championship; after qualifying for the eight-team final round, they started to fight for the title against Baloncieri's Torino. It was a heavy, unexpected defeat at Casale that erased the dreams of Carcano's team, for it wasn't enough to defeat Torino in the direct match to win the championship. Alessandria's Goalkeeper Curti, suspected by most of illicit activities, was soon expelled. Furthermore, authorities, already heavily discredited after the "Allemandi Case", deemed it unnecessary to investigate further into the match.
At the end of the 1928–29 season Alessandria was admitted to the first edition of Serie A tournament (1929–30, 6th place) and finally inaugurated the new stadium. In the early 1930s, several players left the club, still tied to amateurism, to migrate to large centers; Carcano, Ferrari and Bertolini signed for Juventus and Allesandria greatly lost its potential, not gaining anything but middle-ranking positions.
In 1936, the team, after beating Cremonese, Modena, Lazio and Milan, joined the Coppa Italia final, played in Genoa on 11 June and lost to Torino (1–5). In the summer of 1936 S.S. Lazio, who was trying to set up a team which could win the championship, offered the team the considerable amount of 400,000 Italian "lire" for the three promising midfielders Busani, Riccardi and Milano: Alessandria managers agreed, but the team was no longer up to expectations and fell for the first time in Serie B at the end of 1936–37 season.
1937–1956: return in Serie A and first Serie C championships.
The first Serie B championship ended with a new disappointment for Alessandria which, after leading for much of the tournament, fell in the final games, suffering defeats from Modena and Novara. In subsequent years, Alessandria was unable to fight effectively for the promotion; in 1943 the championships were suspended due to the outbreak of World War II. In the 1945–46 season Alessandria, led by coaches Renato Cattaneo and Mario Sperone obtained the return in Serie A. The team remained in Serie A for two seasons and on 2 May 1948 the club suffered the heaviest defeat ever by a team in Italian Serie A history, losing 0–10 against Torino F.C. At the end of that championship, they returned to Serie B.
In the 1940s, Alessandria was the subject of a curious incident when, before a game against Venezia, the referee ordered that Alessandria change uniforms because, in his view, the gray shirt was indistinguishable from the black one of the opponents. After the match, F.I.G.C. asked the arbitrator to undergo an eye examination, which determined that he was color-blind: a test then became mandatory for all referees. Also in those years, the club launched the young talent Gino Armano.
In the late 1940s and during the early 1950s, Alessandria alternated years of Serie B to the first championships in Serie C, following the unfortunate relegation of 1950.
Last seasons in Serie A and decline.
A few months after the beginning of the presidency of the Sacco family, Alessandria returned to Serie A. It happened at the end of the 1956–57 season, after having successfully completed the comeback on Catania and later defeating Brescia in extra time in a qualification match. If in the first decades of its existence the club found its force in its brilliant forwards, this period proved to be an excellent interpreter of the so-called "catenaccio". In 1959 a young Gianni Rivera debuted in Serie A. Also in the same year Alessandria played its first match in an international competition, facing the Velež Mostar in Mitropa Cup.
This happy period for the Alessandria club ended after 1959–60 relegation. In the 1960s, they declined in Serie C and in the early 1970s failed several times in earning a promotion to Serie B. In 1973, the club won the first edition of the Coppa Italia Serie C, defeating Avellino in the final match. At the end of the 1973–74 championships, the club were promoted to Serie B; that season ended up in a frantic way, with coach Dino Ballacci being sacked and the subsequent resignation of chairman Sacco, disputed by supporters.
Serie C years and 2003 bankruptcy.
In 1975, after losing a relegation playoff against Reggiana, Alessandria returned to Serie C. Since that moment they became a fixture in that category for almost thirty years. In the 1986–87 season the club, which was suffering economically after the abandonment of the Calleri family, was sustained for a period by Massese chairman Bertoneri, who was planning to extend his interests in the club (he had tried to negotiate with the leaders of Prato and Carrarese): in that dramatic situation Alessandria relegated for the first time in regional categories, though they improved in the summer of 1987, before losing to Montebelluna.
In that same year the head of Alessandria became the founder of AGV Gino Amisano, who was head of the club for almost fifteen years; in this period the team gained two promotions in Serie C1 (in 1988–89 and 1990–91) and obtained economical support from the clothing company Kappa . In Serie C1 the club obtained good results, but never challenged for promotion; in 1998, after a hard championship, Alessandria fell again to Serie C2, beaten in the relegation playoff by Pistoiese.
After the 1999–2000 season, hopes of promotion subsided the following year, due to declining performances. The next several years were especially turbulent for the club as the Spinelli family struggled with their finances. Alessandria dropped to the amateur leagues and the club was declared formally bankrupt in 2003.
The Comeback in Lega Pro.
Despite the strong opposition of Alessandria supporters, a new club called "Nuova Alessandria" was founded; it took part in the Eccellenza championship. In 2004 a consortium of local businessmen purchased the original brand.
Ever since the 2009–10 season, the club took part in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione championship. In the summer of 2011 it was relegated by the "Corte di Giustizia Federale of FIGC" (the Italian Football Association's Court of Justice) to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione when former club president Giogio Veltroni was found guilty of a betting scandal. Alessandria finally finished Seconda Divisione in 3rd place and qualified to Divisione Unica for 2014–15 season.
Alessandria defeated Genoa in the 2015–16 Coppa Italia to become the first team from the third tier to reach the cup's quarter-finals since Bari had achieved this in 1983–84. They then defeated Spezia 2–1 to reach a semi-final against AC Milan, which they lost 6–0 on aggregate.
Return to Serie B.
During the play-offs of the 2020–21 season for the final promotion to Serie B, Alessandria eliminated Feralpisalò and AlbinoLeffe respectively in the quarter-finals and in the semi-finals, meeting Padova in the final. The first leg at the Euganeo in Padua ended 0–0. In the return match, at Moccagatta in Alessandria, during the 90 minutes of regulation and the following 30 extra minutes the result remained 0–0. The final promotion was therefore decided by penalties, with Alessandria winning 5–4, thus returning, for the first time since 1975, to Serie B. Unfortunately, Alessandria went straight back down from Serie B. They will compete in Serie C for the upcoming 2022–2023 season.
Stadium.
Alessandria is based at the Stadio Giuseppe Moccagatta which was built in 1929 and it can hold 6000 spectators. It is a multi-use stadium; however, it is primarily used for football matches. The stadium is owned by the Municipality of Alessandria. It has a grass pitch whose dimensions are 105 by 68.4 meters. In the past the stadium has contained over 25,000 spectators.

SPAL

Italian association football club based in Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna
Football club
Società Polisportiva Ars et Labor, commonly referred to by the acronym SPAL (), is a professional football club based in Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. The team currently plays in Serie C, the third tier of the Italian football league system.
Founded in 1907, since 1928 they have played their home matches at Stadio Paolo Mazza, named after Paolo Mazza (chairman of the club 1946–1977).
In total, SPAL have participated in 24 top-tier, 28 second-tier, 42 third-tier, 7 fourth-tier and 1 fifth-tier league seasons. The club's best finish was when they came fifth in the 1959–60 Serie A; they also reached the 1961–62 Coppa Italia final.
The club is chaired by the American Joe Tacopina, the current manager is Domenico Di Carlo.
History.
From foundation to World War II.
The club was founded in March 1907 as Circolo Ars et Labor (Latin for "Art and Work Club") by the Salesian priest Pietro Acerbis. In the early stages, it was mainly a cultural and religious association, then in 1913 it became a multi-sports company, taking the name of Società Polisportiva Ars et Labor (Latin for "Sports Club Society of Art and Work") The team began its professional activity under the aegis of the Italian Football Federation (Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio) in 1919, competing in the second-tier tournament.
SPAL played in the top flight league from 1920 to 1925, reaching the qualification playoff for the National Finals in 1921–22. From 1925 until the Second World War, they played in Serie B and Serie C: in this period, the club's all-time top striker Mario Romani scored 130 goals in 189 games during two different periods with the white-blues (1925–32 and 1937–38).
Between 1939 and 1943 the club temporarily changed its name to A.C. Ferrara, wearing the black and white colours of the city. After the suspension of the championships due to war, in 1945 the club returned to the name SPAL and to the light blue and white kits.
The golden period in Serie A.
In 1946 Paolo Mazza became chairman of the club. After five consecutive seasons in Serie B, SPAL won promotion to Serie A after finishing the championship first in 1950–51. The white-blues subsequently stayed in the top division for most of the 1950s and 1960s, competing in 16 out of 17 Serie A seasons from 1951 to 1968.
SPAL finished fifth in 1959–60, thus obtaining the best placement in its history. Also, in 1961–62 they played in the Coppa Italia final, losing against Napoli. In the early stages of 1962–63 season, in which the club finished in eighth place, the white and blues reached the top of the league table. During those years, the club was a launchpad for many young players, among them Fabio Capello.
In 1963–64 they were relegated to Serie B, but they came back to Serie A after only one year, and remained in the top division until 1968. At the end of the last season in the top flight, SPAL won the Cup of Italian-Swiss Friendship.
From 1970s to 21st century.
During 1970s, 1980s and 1990s SPAL played mostly in Serie B and Serie C/C1.
Paolo Mazza quit the presidency in December 1976 and was replaced by Primo Mazzanti. The former chairman died in December 1981 and three months later Ferrara's Stadio Comunale was named after him.
In 1990, Giovanni Donigaglia became chairman of the club: between 1990 and 1992 SPAL obtained back-to-back promotions from Serie C2 to Serie B, under the management of Giovan Battista Fabbri. Donigaglia left the presidency in 2002 with the squad in Serie C1. He was replaced by Lino di Nardo.
Recent years.
The club went bankrupt in 2005, and were reformed as SPAL 1907 S.r.l., under the terms of Article 52 of N.O.I.F. In the summer of 2012, after suffering a second bankruptcy, the club was refounded for the second time as S.s.d. Real SPAL and would begin life in Serie D under the same N.O.I.F. article.
At the end of the 2012–13 season the club took back its original name. Giacomense, a club founded in 1967 at Masi San Giacomo, a "frazione" of Masi Torello, had moved to the city of Ferrara; on 12 July 2013, owner Roberto Benasciutti made a deal with the Colombarini family for a merger between SPAL and Giacomense, with the latter giving its sports title to SPAL and continuing to play in Ferrara. The club changed its name to S.P.A.L. 2013, in order to continue the football history of SPAL. Walter Mattioli became president, with Simone and Francesco Colombarini as main shareholders.
They finished the 2013–14 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione season in sixth place, thus qualifying for the inaugural unified 2014–15 Lega Pro season. In 2015–16, the squad won promotion to Serie B for the first time since the 1992–93 season, after finishing first in group B of the Lega Pro. The following year they came first in Serie B, thus obtaining promotion to Serie A after a 49-year absence. In their first season back in Serie A, SPAL avoided relegation by finishing in 17th place. At the end of the 2018–19 season they confirmed their presence in the top flight for a third consecutive year, finishing 13th. The club had mixed fortunes in the 2019–2020 season and, after gaining just 15 points in 23 games, coach Leonardo Semplici was dismissed in February 2020, replaced by Luigi Di Biagio. SPAL were relegated to Serie B, finishing in last place with 20 points. The club reached the 2020–21 Coppa Italia quarter-finals, becoming the only team from Serie B to advance to that stage in the competition.
In August 2021, the club was acquired by the American lawyer and businessman Joe Tacopina. Some media say that the real owners behind Mr. Tacopina are the controversial brothers Alessandro Bazzoni and Lorenzo Bazzoni, an Italian businessmen linked with the government of Nicolas Maduro.
Colours, badge and nicknames.
The team's colours are light blue and white, which derive from the Salesians' emblem. The home kit, since 1962, has been composed of a vertical striped light blue-white shirt, white trainers and white socks. The only exception to light blue and white was when the club adopted a black and white kit between 1939 and 1943 (when it was named A.C. Ferrara), in honour of Ferrara's civic colours.
Currently the badge features an oval-shaped light blue escutcheon, with a white band in the upper section, on which is written the acronym "S.P.A.L." in golden characters. Also, in the lower section, the black and white emblem of the city is featured. From 1980 until mid-1990s, the official badge featured a fawn, another symbol of the club.
SPAL's most common nicknames are "Biancazzurri" (from the club colours, light blue and white) and "Estensi" (from the House of Este, ancient European noble dynasty that ruled Ferrara from 1240 to 1597).
Stadium.
The current home ground of SPAL is the 16,134 seater Stadio Paolo Mazza. The stadium was opened in September 1928 as Stadio Comunale, then took on its current name in February 1982, in honour of the former president of the club Paolo Mazza, who died two months earlier.
Initially it had a capacity of 4,000. Then, in concomitance with the promotion of SPAL to Serie A, in 1951 it was subjected to a heavy restructuring that brought capacity to 25,000. Between 1960s and 1980s it was renovated again, reducing the number of possible spectators to 22,000 until the mid-2000s.
From 2005 to 2016 the stadium capacity was limited to 7,500 due to safety reasons and cost containment. In 2016–17, after the club's promotion to Serie B and then to Serie A, the stadium was restructured again to match the modern needs of comfort and safety. In the summer of 2018 a further remodeling took place, in order to bring the total capacity from 13,135 seats to 16,134.

UC Sampdoria

Italian association football club
Football club
Unione Calcio Sampdoria, commonly referred to as Sampdoria (), is an Italian professional football club from Liguria, based in Bogliasco in the Province of Genoa. They compete in Serie B, the second division of the Italian football league system.
Sampdoria was formed in 1946 from the merger of two existing sports clubs, Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria. Both the team name and colours reflect this union, the first being a combination of the names, the second taking the form of a unique kit design, predominantly blue (for Andrea Doria) with white, red and black bands (for Sampierdarenese) across the centre of the shirt, hence the nickname "blucerchiati" ("blue-circled").
Sampdoria play at Stadio Luigi Ferraris, capacity 33,205, which it shares with Genoa's older club, Genoa Cricket and Football Club. The fierce rivalry between the two teams is commonly known as the "Derby della Lanterna", and has been contested in Serie A for most of its history.
Sampdoria have won the "Scudetto" once in their history, in 1991. The club has also won the Coppa Italia four times, in 1985, 1988, 1989 and 1994, and the Supercoppa Italiana once, in 1991. Their biggest European success came when they won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1990. They also reached the European Cup final in 1992, losing the final 1–0 to Barcelona after extra-time.
History.
Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria (1891–1927).
Ginnastica Sampierdarenese was founded in 1891, opening its football section in 1899. Named to honour Andrea Doria, a club named Società Andrea Doria was founded in 1895, which increasingly focused itself on football training and competition.
Andrea Doria did not participate in the first Italian Football Championship which was organised by the Italian Federation of Football (FIF) since instead they had enrolled themselves into a football tournament which was organised by the Italian Federation of Ginnastica. The club eventually joined the competition for the 1903 Italian Football Championship, but did not win a game in the tournament until 1907, when they beat local rivals Genoa 3–1. It was not until 1910–11 that the club began to show promise. During that season's tournament, they finished above Juventus, Internazionale and Genoa in the "Piedmont-Lombardy-Liguria" section.
After World War I, Sampierdarenese finally began to compete in the Italian Championship, after they took the place of Bolzaneto's Associazione del Calcio Ligure a pre-war club of the province of Genoa (in turn, Ligure was the heir of Liguria Foot Ball Club, a team founded in 1897). Thus, Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria met in the championship for the first time; Doria won in first-leg game (4–1 and 1–1), and they also finished in second place after Genoa in the Ligurian Championship, qualifying for the National Round.
With the 1921–22 season, the Italian top league was split into two competitions; both clubs were in separate competitions that year too. Sampierdarenese played in the FIGC-run competition, whereas Andrea Doria played in the CCI variation. Sampierdarenese won the Liguria section and then went on to the semi-finals, finishing top out of three clubs; this led them to the final against Novese. Both legs of the final ended in 0–0 draws, thus a repetition match was played in Cremona on 21 May 1922. The match went into extra time with Novese eventually winning the tie (and the Championship) 2–1.
After the league system in Italy was brought back into one league, Sampierdarenese remained stronger than Andrea Doria by qualifying for the league. By 1924–25, the clubs were competing against each other in the Northern League; Andrea Doria finished one place above their rivals and won one match 2–1, while Sampierdarenese were victorious 2–0 in the other.
From La Dominante to Sampdoria (1927–1946).
At the end of the 1926–27 season, Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria merged for the first time under the name La Dominante by fascist authorities.
Football club
Wearing green and black striped shirts, La Dominante Genova were admitted to the first-ever season of Serie B, where they finished third, just missing out on promotion. The next season, under the name Foot Ball Club Liguria, they had a disastrous year, finishing bottom of the table and suffering relegation.
Because of this, both Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria reverted to their previous names as separate clubs. Sampierdarenese were back in Serie B for the 1932–33 season and finished in the upper part. The following year, they were crowned champions and were promoted into Serie A for the first time. Andrea Doria, on the other hand, battled out the 1930s down in Serie C.
On 15 July 1937 Sampierdarenese absorbed Corniglianese and Rivarolese, with the club adopting the name Associazione Calcio Liguria. This saw them reach fifth place in Serie A in 1939. In the early 1940s, the club was relegated but bounced straight back up as Serie B champions in 1941.
After World War II, both Andrea Doria and Sampierdarenese (the name Liguria was abolished in 1945) were competing in Serie A, but in a reverse of pre-war situations, Andrea Doria were now the top club out of the two. However, on 12 August 1946, a merger occurred to create Unione Calcio Sampdoria.
The first chairman of this new club was Piero Sanguineti, but the ambitious entrepreneur Amedeo Rissotto soon replaced him, while the first team coach during this period was a man from Florence named Giuseppe Galluzzi. To illustrate the clubs would be equally represented in the new, merged club, a new kit was designed featuring the blue shirts of Andrea Doria and the white, red and black midsection of Sampierdarenese. In the same month of the merger, the new club demanded they should share the Stadio Luigi Ferraris ground with Genoa. An agreement was reached, and the stadium began hosting Genoa's and Sampdoria's home matches.
Early years and the achievements in the Mantovani era (1946–1993).
For about thirty years the Genoese played constantly in Serie A, with mixed results, the best of which was in the 1960–1961 season, in which they obtained fourth place in the championship. In the 1965–1966 season Sampdoria finished sixteenth, relegating to Serie B for the first time in its history; however, the following year they won the second-tier championship and immediately returned to Serie A.
In 1979, the club, then playing Serie B, was acquired by oil businessman Paolo Mantovani (1930–1993), who invested in the team to bring Sampdoria to the top flight. In 1982, Sampdoria made their Serie A return and won their first Coppa Italia in 1985. In 1986, Yugoslav Vujadin Boškov was appointed as the new head coach. The club won their second Coppa Italia in 1988, being admitted to the 1988–89 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, where they reached the final, losing 2–0 to Barcelona. A second consecutive triumph in the Coppa Italia gave Sampdoria a spot in the 1989–90 Cup Winners' Cup, which they won after defeating Anderlecht after extra time in the final.
This was followed only one year later by their first and only "Scudetto", being crowned as Serie A champions with a five-point advantage over second-placed Internazionale. The winning team featured several notable players, such as Gianluca Pagliuca, Gianluca Vialli, Roberto Mancini, Toninho Cerezo, Pietro Vierchowod and Attilio Lombardo, with Boškov as head coach. In the following season, Sampdoria reached the European Cup final and were defeated once again by Barcelona, at Wembley Stadium.
Vujadin Boškov is recognised as one of Sampdoria's most successful managers winning a record amount of trophies and thus further establishing the club's reputation in Europe.
Decline and resurgence and decline again (1993–present).
On 14 October 1993, Paolo Mantovani died suddenly and was replaced by his son Enrico. During his first season (1993–94), Sampdoria won one more Coppa Italia and placed third in Serie A. During the following four seasons, many players from his father's tenure left the club but many important acquisitions were made which kept Sampdoria in the top tier Serie A. This included the likes of Argentine internationals Juan Sebastián Verón and Ariel Ortega, and international midfielders Clarence Seedorf and Christian Karembeu. In April 1995 Sampdoria reached the semi-final stage of the Cup Winners' Cup, losing out to Arsenal on penalties after two legs.
In May 1999 Sampdoria were relegated from Serie A and did not return to the top flight until 2003. During this time, Sampdoria was acquired by Riccardo Garrone, an Italian oil businessman. Sampdoria returned to Serie A in 2003 led by talisman Francesco Flachi, and ended their first season in eighth place. After several more top-half finishes, manager Walter Novellino gave way to Walter Mazzarri in 2007.
With the signings of forwards Antonio Cassano from Real Madrid, and Giampaolo Pazzini in January 2008, Sampdoria ended the 2007–08 season in sixth position and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup. The following season, they came fourth and qualified for the UEFA Champions League play-offs under manager Luigi Delneri, who left for Juventus. With the departures also of CEO Giuseppe Marotta, and both Cassano and Pazzini, and the squad being stretched by Champions League football, Sampdoria were relegated to Serie B after a 2–1 loss at home to Palermo in May 2011. In the following season June 2012, Sampdoria won promotion back to Serie A after defeating Varese 4–2 on aggregate in the play-off final.
Following the death of Riccardo Garrone the previous year, the club was purchased from the Garrone family in June 2014 by the film producer Massimo Ferrero. After sixth-placed rivals Genoa in the 2014–15 season failed to obtain a UEFA license for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League, seventh-placed Sampdoria took their spot. The club built a solid foundation in Serie A for the next seven years. Notable managerial appointments were Marco Giampaolo and Claudio Ranieri, as well as the steady flow of goals from talismanic striker Fabio Quagliarella. Growing tensions however surrounded Ferrero's presidency, fuelled by his well-known and public support of AS Roma. Several attempts were made to sell the club, including to a consortium led by club legend Gianluca Vialli. On 6 December 2021 Massimo Ferrero was arrested by Italian police as part of ongoing investigations into corporate crimes and bankruptcy. He resigned from his position as President of Sampdoria with immediate effect, whilst a club statement assured fans that the affairs of the football club were not a part of the investigations. On 27 December, former player Marco Lanna was appointed President. In January 2022 the club welcomed back former manager Marco Giampaolo after a disappointing start to the season under Roberto D'Aversa. On 6 February in his first home game back in charge, Sampdoria defeated Sassuolo 4-0. Results however began to dwindle, and after eight games and a winless start to the 2022–23 season the club parted company with Giampaolo. On 6 October former Serie A player legend Dejan Stanković was appointed to the role with the task of steering the club clear of the relegation zone. Samp was later relegated in the 2022/23 season from Serie A to Serie B and in later May 2023 former Leeds United owner Andrea Radrizzani reached an agreement with previous owner Massimo Ferrero to buy Sampdoria and prevent it from bankruptcy.
On 27 June 2023, former Italy and Serie A legend Andrea Pirlo was appointed as the manager.

Colours, badge and nicknames.
The white, blue, red and black colours represent the club's origins with a merger between two teams, Sampierdarenese and Andrea Doria, who wore respectively red/black and white/blue jerseys with a shield with Saint-George cross.
The club crest features a sailor in profile known by the old Genoese name of Baciccia, which translates to Gio-Batta in Ligurian, Giovanni Battista in Italian or John-Baptist in English. The image of a sailor is appropriate due to Sampdoria being tied to Ligurian fishermen. The precise design of the Baciccia came from a Disney-licensed and Panini-published comic, "Topolino", in 1980. Since 1980, the Baciccia has appeared on the shirts of Sampdoria, mostly on the chest but occasionally on the sleeve.
Supporters and rivalries.
Sampdoria supporters come mainly from the city of Genoa. The biggest group are Ultras Tito Cucchiaroni, named after an Argentinian left winger who played for Sampdoria. The group were founded in 1969, making it one of the oldest ultra groups in Italy. They are apolitical, although there are smaller groups like Rude Boys Sampdoria, who are left-wing, but today this group is no longer active. The main support with flags and flares comes from the southern Curva, Gradinata Sud.
Sampdoria's biggest rivals are Genoa, against whom they play the "Derby della Lanterna".

AC Carpi

Italian football club
Football club
AC Carpi is an Italian professional football club based in Carpi, a city in the province of Modena. The club was founded in 1909, re-founded in 2000 and 2022.
Carpi's colours are white and red, hence the nickname "Biancorossi". At the end of the 2012–13 season, Carpi won their first promotion to Serie B. On 28 April 2015, the Biancorossi won their first promotion to Serie A, but were relegated back to Serie B after only one season.
The Golden Era ended in 2019, with the relegation back in Serie C after five seasons in Serie B and one season in Serie A. 
The Biancorossi have won a handful of league titles, including: the old Lega Pro Seconda Divisione; Serie B once; Serie C once; and Serie D four times. At the regional level, Carpi has won Promozione, Prima Divisione, and two Prima Categoria titles.
History.
A.C. Carpi (1909–2000).
The club was founded in the summer of 1909 by local student Adolfo Fanconi as "Jucunditas" (Latin for "gaiety"), and changed their denomination to "Associazione Calcio Carpi" a few years later. Carpi played three seasons in the Italian Football Championship, the precursor to Serie A, from the 1919–20 season until 1921–22. Starting from the 1930s, they mostly played between Serie C and Serie D. Carpi achieved their best result in 1997, a third-placed finish under coach Luigi De Canio which allowed them to play the Serie B promotion playoffs then lost to Monza. The club was cancelled in 2000 following relegation to Serie D and subsequent bankruptcy.
Carpi F.C. 1909 (2000–2021).
A new club, named "Calcio Carpi", was therefore admitted to "Eccellenza Emilia–Romagna". The club assumed the current denomination in 2002, following promotion to Serie D and a merger with the second team of the city, Dorando Pietri Carpi, that had just reached Serie D as well. Pietri Carpi also sold its license to Boca.
At the end of the 2009–10 season, through repechage due to the number of teams with financial difficulties, the club was admitted into Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. In 2010–11, the club's first season in the higher division, it was promoted again to Lega Pro Prima Divisione. Because of the work being done on their stadium, the Sandro Cabasisi, the team played in the Mapei Stadium – Città del Tricolore in the 2011–12 season.
Serie B (2013).
In the season 2012–13 the team was promoted from Lega Pro Prima Divisione to Serie B for the first time when they defeated Lecce in the Girone A Play-off Final 2–1 on aggregate. This was the club's third promotion in just four seasons.
Carpi FC's first fixture at Serie B level ended in a 1–0 defeat away to Ternana on 24 August 2013. Their first win was a 2–0 victory at Spezia courtesy of goals from Fabio Concas &amp; Roberto Inglese. Carpi's first season in Serie B ended in a 12th-place finish, only three points away from a promotion play-off place, ensuring their place for another season.
Serie A debut promotion (2015).
The 2014–15 Serie B campaign saw Carpi, managed by experienced coach Fabrizio Castori, completing the first half of the season (21 games) in a first place, with a record of 43 points and a nine-point advantage over second-placed Frosinone. On 28 April 2015, after a goalless draw with Bari, the club was promoted for the first time to Serie A.
Carpi's first season saw a complete overhaul of the squad from the season previous due to the departure of long-time director of football Cristiano Giuntoli, who had masterminded the club's rise from the amateur Serie D to the top flight, to Napoli. He was subsequently replaced by Sean Sogliano.
On 28 September 2015, after a 1–5 loss to Roma, the club announced it had relieved Castori of his coaching duties with immediate effect, replacing him with Giuseppe Sannino in the first managerial change of the 2015–16 Serie A season. Carpi had achieved just two points from its opening six matches. On 3 November, the club performed a U-turn, and Castori was rehired. The club's debut top-flight season ultimately ended in relegation by a single point, with the club having found itself in a relegation dogfight from virtually the start of the season.
The following season saw another complete reconstruction of the first-team, with several important players returning to their parent clubs from loan, as Carpi sought an immediate return to Serie A. However, they fell to Benevento in the playoff final.
Decline and Bankruptcy (2017–2021).
In the 2017–18 Serie B season, Carpi placed 11th, but the following season was marred by difficulties that caused the team's relegation to Serie C after six years, after having placed last with just 29 points.
The 2019–20 Serie C season started well for Carpi, which placed second in its group before the COVID-19 pandemic halted the season. Carpi then went to the playoffs, but lost to Novara in the quarter finals.
The following season saw Carpi placing 15th in its group, narrowly avoiding relegation.
However, in July 2021, the COVISOC rejected the club's admission to the 2021–22 Serie C, citing unpaid taxes and contributions between 2020 and 2021. The club was successively excluded entirely from Italian football.
Athletic Carpi / A.C. Carpi (2021–current).
In 2021, following the disbandment of the original Carpi, a new but distinct club named Athletic Carpi played in the 2021–22 Serie D season. On 13 September 2022, the club, renamed A.C. Carpi, eventually acquired all the naming and historical rights of the original one, thus formally becoming the direct heir of Carpi FC 1909.

AC ChievoVerona

Professional Italian football club
Football club
Associazione Calcio ChievoVerona, commonly referred to as ChievoVerona or simply Chievo , is a former professional Italian football club named after and based in Chievo, a suburb of 4,500 inhabitants in Verona, Veneto, and owned by Paluani, a bakery product company and the inspiration for their original name, Paluani Chievo. During its years as a professional club, Chievo shared the 38,402 seater Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi stadium with its cross-town rivals Hellas Verona.
In 2021, the club was excluded from professional football because of financial problems. 
History.
Early years.
The team was founded in 1929 by a small number of football fans from Chievo, a Verona . Initially the club was not officially affiliated to the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), but nonetheless played several amateur tournament and friendly matches under the denomination O.N.D. Chievo, a title imposed by the fascist regime. The club's formal debut in an official league was on 8 November 1931. The team colours at the time were blue and white. Chievo disbanded in 1936, however, due to economic woes but returned to play in 1948 after World War II, being registered in the regional league of (Second Division). In 1957, the team moved to the field "Carlantonio Bottagisio", where they played until 1986. In 1959, after the restructuring of the football leagues, Chievo was admitted to play the Seconda Categoria (Second Category), a regional league placed next-to-last in the Italian football pyramid. That year, Chievo changed its name to Cardi Chievo, after a new sponsor, and was quickly promoted to the Prima Categoria, from which it experienced its first-ever relegation in 1962.
Series of promotions.
In 1964, Luigi Campedelli, a businessman and owner of the Paluani company, was named new Chievo chairman. Under Campedelli's presidency, Chievo climbed through the entire Italian football pyramid, reaching the Serie D after the 1974–75 season. Under the name "Paluani Chievo", the team was promoted to Serie C2 in 1986. As a consequence of promotion, Chievo was forced to move to the Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi, the main venue in Verona; another promotion, to Serie C1, followed in 1989. In 1990, the team changed its name to its current one, "A.C. ChievoVerona."
In 1992, President Luigi Campedelli, who had returned at the helm of the club two years before, died of a heart attack, and his son Luca Campedelli, aged just 23, became the new and youngest chairman of an Italian professional football club. Campedelli promoted Giovanni Sartori to director of football and named Alberto Malesani as the new head coach. Under Malesani, the team astonishingly won the Serie C1 and was promoted to Serie B, where city rival Hellas Verona was playing at the time. In 1997, after Malesani signed for Fiorentina, Silvio Baldini was appointed the new head coach. The following season, with Domenico Caso as the coach, saw the first dismissal of a coach during the presidency of Luca Campedelli, with Caso being fired and replaced with Lorenzo Balestro. It was during these years that the nickname "mussi volanti" ("flying donkeys") was born. It originated from supporters of their crosstown rivals Hellas, who would mock long-suffering Chievo supporters that Chievo will only be promoted if "donkeys could fly" (equivalent of the English language falsism "if pigs could fly", denoting an impossible dream).
In 2000–01, Luigi Delneri was signed as coach and led Chievo, by virtue of its third-place finish in Serie B, to promotion to Serie A, the first time in team history that it had reached the top tier of Italian football.
Mussi Volanti (2001–2007).
In 2001–02, Chievo's Serie A debut season, the team was most critics' choice for an instant return to Serie B. However, they became the surprise team in the league, playing often spectacular and entertaining football and even leading the league for six consecutive weeks. The club finally ended the season with a highly respectable fifth-place finish, qualifying the team to play in the UEFA Cup. Chievo's impressive performance inspired a 2002 book about soccer economics titled "Fenomeno Chievo. Economia, costume, società" by Marco Vitale.
In 2002–03, Chievo debuted at the European level but were eliminated in the first round by Red Star Belgrade. The team finished the Serie A season in seventh place, again proving itself one of the better Serie A teams. The 2003–04 season, the last with Delneri at the helm, saw Chievo finish ninth.
The 2004–05 season is remembered as one of the toughest ever in Chievo's history. Mario Beretta, a Serie A novice from Ternana, was named coach, but after a strong start that brought Chievo to third behind Juventus and Milan, the team slowly lost position in the league table. With three matches remaining in the season, Chievo was third-from-last, a position which would see it relegated to Serie B. As a last resort, Beretta was fired and Maurizio D'Angelo, a former Chievo player, was appointed temporarily to replace him as coach. Morale improved, and two wins and a draw from the final three matches proved just enough to keep Chievo in Serie A.
In 2005–06, Giuseppe Pillon of Treviso FBC was appointed as new coach. The team experienced a return to the successful Delneri era, both in style of play and results, which resulted in Chievo ending the season in seventh and gaining a berth in the UEFA Cup. However, because of the football scandal involving several top-class teams, all of which finished higher than Chievo in the 2005–06 season, the Flying Donkeys were awarded a place in the next Champions League preliminary phase.
On 14 July 2006, the verdict in the scandal was made public. Juventus, Milan and Fiorentina, who had all originally qualified for the 2006–07 Champions League, and Lazio, who had originally qualified for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup, were all banned from UEFA competition for the 2006–07 season, although Milan were allowed to enter the Champions League after their appeal to the FIGC. Chievo took up a place in the third qualifying stage of the competition along with Milan and faced Bulgarian side Levski Sofia. Chievo lost the first leg 2–0 in Sofia and managed a 2–2 home draw on the second leg and were eliminated by a 4–2 aggregate score with Levski advancing to the Champions League group stage. As a Champions League third round qualifying loser, Chievo was given a place in the UEFA Cup final qualifying round. On 25 August 2006, they were drawn to face Portuguese side Braga. The first leg, played on 14 September in Braga, ended in a 2–0 win for the Portuguese. The return match, played on 28 September in Verona, although won by Chievo 2–1, resulted in a 3–2 aggregate loss and the club's elimination from the competition.
On 16 October 2006, following a 1–0 defeat against Torino, head coach Giuseppe Pillon was fired, and replaced by Luigi Delneri, one of the original symbols of the "miracle Chievo", who had led the club to the Serie A in 2002.
On 27 May 2007, the last match day of the 2006–07 Serie A season, Chievo was one of five teams in danger of falling into the last undecided relegation spot. Needing only a draw against Catania, a direct competitor in the relegation battle, Chievo lost 2–0 playing on a neutral field in Bologna. Wins by Parma, Siena and Reggina condemned Chievo to Serie B for the 2007–08 season after six seasons in the top flight.
Even as a relatively-successful Serie A team the club, which averages only 9,000 to 10,000 fans and is kept afloat mainly by money from television rights, does not have the same number of fan supporters as Hellas, the oldest team in Verona. The difference between the clubs' supporters' number was highlighted during local derby games played in season 2001–02 at the clubs' shared stadium when, for Chievo's "home" fixtures, the Chievo fans were located in the "away" end of the stadium (the area of the stadium Chievo's supporters for years claimed as "theirs", in fact the main supporters faction's name is "North Side", the side of the stadium usually assigned to away teams' supporters), while most of the rest of the stadium seats were assigned to Hellas supporters.
A year with the "Cadetti" (2007–08).
Chievo bounced back quickly from the disappointment of their relegation on the last matchday of 2006–07, going in search of an immediate promotion back to the top flight. After the expected departure of several top-quality players including Franco Semioli, Salvatore Lanna, Matteo Brighi, Paolo Sammarco and Erjon Bogdani, the manager Delneri also parted ways with the club. Giuseppe Iachini replaced him and the captain, Lorenzo D'Anna, gave way to Sergio Pellissier at the end of the transfer window. A new squad was constructed, most notably including the arrivals of midfielders Maurizio Ciaramitaro and Simone Bentivoglio, defender César and forward Antimo Iunco. This new incarnation of the "gialloblu" were crowned winter champions (along with Bologna), en route to a 41st matchday promotion after a 1–1 draw at Grosseto left them four points clear of third-place Lecce with one match remaining. In addition to winning promotion, they were conferred with the Ali della Vittoria trophy on the final matchday of the season, their first league title of any kind in 14 years.
Back in Serie A (2008–2019).
In their first season back to the top flight, Chievo immediately struggled in the league resulting in the dismissal of Iachini in November and his replacement with former Parma boss Domenico Di Carlo. After Di Carlo's appointment, Chievo managed a remarkable resurgence that led the "gialloblu" out of the relegation zone after having collected just nine points from their first 17 matches. Highlight matches included a 3–0 defeat of Lazio (who then won the 2008–09 Coppa Italia title) at the Stadio Olimpico, and a thrilling 3–3 draw away to Juventus in which captain and longtime Chievo striker Sergio Pellissier scored a late equaliser to complete his first career hat-trick. A series of hard-fought draws against top clubs Roma, Internazionale and Genoa in the final stretch of the season solidified "Ceo"'s position outside the drop zone and Serie A status was finally confirmed on matchday 37 with a home draw against Bologna. A largely unchanged line-up earned safety the following season with four matchdays to spare, and Chievo was therefore part of the inaugural Lega Calcio Serie A in 2010–11, their third consecutive season (and ninth season in the last ten years) in the top flight of Italian football.
Lorenzo D'Anna remained as coach of the club for the 2018–19 season after replacing Rolando Maran during the 2017–18 season. On 13 September, Chievo were deducted 3 points after being found guilty of false accounting on exchanging players with Cesena. President Luca Campedelli was banned for three months as a result of the scheme. Chievo were officially relegated on 14 April 2019 after a 3–1 home loss to Napoli.
Serie B years and league exclusion (2019–2021).
In July 2021, Chievo was expelled from Serie B for the 2021–22 season for being unable to prove its financial viability due to outstanding tax payments. The club argued that there was an agreement in place during the COVID-19 pandemic that allowed them to spread the payments out over a longer period. However, after three unsuccessful appeals, the decision to bar Chievo Verona from registering to Serie B was upheld, with Cosenza taking their place in Serie B.
Over the next month, former captain Sergio Pellissier led the search for a new ownership group to allow a phoenix club to compete in Serie D under the Chievo name. However, on 21 August, Pellissier announced in an Instagram post that no owners were found in time for the Serie D registration deadline. The original Chievo club has in the meantime appealed to the Council of State against its exclusion and is currently registered in no division, albeit still with the right to apply for a spot in an amateur league of Veneto in the following weeks. Campedelli eventually opted to keep the club alive as a youth team for the 2021–22 season, while Pellissier decided instead
to found a new club himself, which was admitted to Terza Categoria at the very bottom of the Italian football league system; the club, originally named FC Chievo 2021, was then renamed to FC Clivense following a legal warning from AC ChievoVerona.
FC Clivense eventually won Group B of the Terza Categoria Verona 2021–22, ending up promoted in Seconda Categoria. On 13 July 2022, FC Clivense registered for the 2022–23 season of Eccellenza, the 5th tier of Italian football, where they would eventually gain promotion in Serie D

Colours and badge.
The club's original colours were blue and white and not the current blue and yellow. The club's historic nickname is "Gialloblu" (from the club colours of yellow and blue), although throughout Italian football, the Verona's team recognised in the past by most fans as "Gialloblu" are Hellas Verona, Chievo's main rivals. Local supporters often call the club simply "Ceo", which is Venetian for Chievo. The club is now sometimes referred to as the "I Mussi Volanti" ("The Flying Donkeys" in the Verona dialect of Venetian). "The Flying Donkeys" nickname was originally used by fans from crosstown rivals Hellas to mock Chievo. The two clubs first met in Serie B in the mid-1990s, with Hellas chanting "Quando i mussi volara, il Ceo in Serie A" – "Donkeys will fly before Chievo are in Serie A." However, once Chievo earned promotion to Serie A at the end of the 2000–01 Serie B season, Chievo fans started to call themselves "The Flying Donkeys".
The current club crest represents Cangrande I della Scala, a medieval lord of Verona.

Bologna FC 1909

Association football club in Italy
Football club
Bologna Football Club 1909, commonly referred to as Bologna (), is an Italian professional football club based in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna that plays in Serie A, the top flight of Italian football. The club have won seven top-flight titles, two Coppa Italia titles, and one UEFA Intertoto Cup.
Founded in 1909, Bologna were founding members of Serie A, and won many of their league championships during the late 1930s. The club ceded any league dominance by 1964, when they won their last league title to date. They won their two Coppa Italia titles in the 1970s, before battling relegation throughout the latter part of the 20th century. Bologna changed ownership multiple times during the early 2000s and 2010s, due to financial mismanagement, and later stabilized under the guise of a Canadian consortium led by Joey Saputo.
Bologna have participated in 75 Serie A seasons, which is the ninth-most in Italian football history. The club have played in the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara since 1927, which is the tenth-largest stadium by capacity in Serie A.
History.
Bologna Football Club's formation was orchestrated by Emilio Arnstein, an Austrian who became interested in football at university in Vienna and Prague. He and his brother had previously founded another football club, Black Star, in Austria.
The club was founded on 3 October 1909, in the Northern Italian city of Bologna. Upon its formation, Carlo Sandoni was the club's sponsor and general manager, Swiss Louis Rauch became president, nobleman Guido Della Valle was the vice-president, Enrico Penaglia secretary, Sergio Lampronti cashier, while Emilio Arnstein and Leone Vincenzi were appointed councilmen.
On 20 March 1910, Bologna played their first ever game, against Virtus, who wore white shirts. Bologna outclassed their opponents, winning 9–1. The first football squad featured; Koch, Chiara, Pessarelli, Bragaglia, Guido Della Valle, Nanni, Donati, Rauch, Bernabeu, Mezzano, and Gradi.
Their formative season was spent in the regional league under Arrigo Gradi as captain, Bologna won their league gaining promotion to a league named "Group Veneto-Emiliano". They spent four seasons in this league, never finishing lower than fifth. Bologna were entered into the Northern League before all football leagues were postponed for the First World War.
Champions: 1920s and 1930s.
After the First World War, Bologna began to become more successful. First reaching the semi-finals of the Northern Italian competition in 1919–20, they went one better the following season by reaching the Northern League finals, going out 2–1 to Pro Vercelli. They would equal this again in 1923–24, coming runner up to eventual national champions Genoa.
Bologna became Northern and National League champions for the first time during 1924–25, beating Genoa after five hard-fought final matches to take the championship. The finals against the Ligurian giants were marred by heavy crowd troubles. A few seasons later Bologna became champions of Italy for the second time in 1928–29 giving them a foothold in Italian football, building up a legacy, this was the last time the league was competed in the old system, Serie A was instated the following year.
Bologna won the "Scudetto" three more times before the Second World War, in 1935–36, 1936–37 and 1938–39, and once during the war (1940–41).
Post-Second World War.
After the Second World War, the club was less successful. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the club generally floated between fourth, fifth and sixth position in the league, until they took the league title back in 1963–64. To date this remains their last Serie A championship, bringing the club's total to seven. This qualified Bologna to the 1964–65 European Cup (today UEFA Champions League), but they were eliminated in the preliminary round against Anderlecht.
It was not all doom and gloom for the club, however; in the 1970s, they won the Italian Cup twice, the second of which was disputed against Palermo. The game was tense and finished 1–1 before going to a penalty shootout, where Bologna won 4–3.
Climbing down and back up the Leagues.
Beginning in the 1981–82 season, the club began to slide. First, they were relegated from Serie A after battling it out for survival with Cagliari and Genoa. They were relegated twice in succession and slid into Serie C1. They won their way out of C1 the next year, and returned to Serie A for the 1988–89 season after four years of fighting it out in Serie B.
They did not remain long, however, being relegated in 1991 and returning to Serie C1 in 1993. The club returned to Serie A for 1996. Two years later, Bologna tasted a slice of success on the European stage, winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup and playing in the UEFA Cup. The club remained in Serie A until the 2004–05 campaign, losing to Parma in the playoffs.
Serie B.
Despite losing some key players, Bologna expected to be challenging strongly for promotion from Serie B in the 2005–06 campaign. Despite its ambition, however, Bologna had a poor start to the season, causing the sacking of experienced coach Renzo Ulivieri, replaced by former Internazionale defender Andrea Mandorlini.
During this time, the team was sold by Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara to Alfredo Cazzola, a local entrepreneur. Mandorlini, however, was not either able to bring Bologna up the Serie B table, and was fired on 5 March 2006; Ulivieri was then appointed back as team coach, after having been sacked a few months before. Bologna ended the 2005–06 Serie B campaign in eighth place. In the 2006–07 season, Bologna ended with the seventh place: there were several clashes between chairman Cazzola and head coach Ulivieri, who was ultimately fired on 14 April 2007 and replaced by caretaker and former assistant coach Luca Cecconi. For the 2007–08 season, Bologna was led by Daniele Arrigoni, who helped the "rossoblù" achieve automatic promotion back to the top flight after finishing second in Serie B.
Serie A.
During the summer of 2008, a club takeover was agreed between Cazzola and an American-based consortium; this was, however, cancelled in the end, following disagreements between the parties, and the club was successively sold to a local group led by new chairman Francesca Menarini, who thus became the second female chairman in the whole Serie A. Arrigoni was confirmed as head coach by the new group, and the start appeared to be particularly impressive, with a surprising 2–1 win at San Siro against Milan thanks to a winning goal scored by Francesco Valiani. The next weeks saw Bologna struggling in the league, however, with eight losses in nine matches. A disappointing 5–1 loss to Cagliari ultimately led the club management to sack Daniele Arrigoni on 3 November 2008 and appoint Siniša Mihajlović as new "rossoblù" boss.
On 14 April 2009, Giuseppe Papadopulo was appointed as the new manager, and successfully managed to raise the team spirit avoiding relegation to Serie B only in the last match of the season. In the 2009–10 season, Bologna played in Serie A for the 65th time, and escaped relegation again despite financial issues under new head coach Franco Colomba.
In June 2010, a club takeover was completed, with the club being sold by the Menarini family to Sardinian entrepreneur Sergio Porcedda. Franco Colomba was sacked right before the 2010–11 season opener on 29 August 2010, despite surviving relegation with the team in the 2009–10 season. The president of the club, Sergio Porcedda, said that the decision was made mostly "because he [Colomba] was skeptical of the team."
The consortium "Bologna 2010".
On 23 December 2010, the consortium "Bologna 2010" led by banker Giovanni Consorte and coffee businessman Massimo Zanetti acquired the club from Sergio Porcedda, after the latter failed to pay wages for the club during his short-tenured ownership and put Bologna in threat of bankruptcy. The company also owed agent fee to Leonardo Corsi in the Andrea Raggi's transfer. Zanetti also became the new club chairman, with popular Italian musician and long-time Bologna supporter Gianni Morandi appointed as honorary president.
On 21 January 2011, chairman Massimo Zanetti and CEO Luca Baraldi, after only 28 days, resigned because of irreconcilable differences with the other personal and financial partners. Stefano Pedrelli became the new director general. For 76 days, the chairman was Marco Pavignani.
From 7 April 2011, after the resignation of Pavignani and having paid €2.5m of capital increase, the new chairman was Albano Guaraldi, the second largest shareholder of the consortium "Bologna 2010" with the 17% of the quotas, behind the outgoing Zanetti.
The 2013–14 season saw Bologna once again relegated to the Serie B, and also gave light to a number of financial problems involving the club and its ownership of Albino Guaraldi, who was considerably criticized by the team supporters also for a number of controversial decisions, including the sale of star player Alessandro Diamanti to Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande. A new head coach was then found in former Cagliari boss Diego López for the new season, whereas Guaraldi clearly stated his intention to hand over his Bologna stakes to a new owner. A North American group headed by Joe Tacopina and Joey Saputo (owner of CF Montréal, also the team of former Bologna hero Marco Di Vaio) then stated its interest in acquiring the club; this was followed by another offer coming from former chairman Massimo Zanetti. On 15 October 2014, the board of directors ratified the sale of the club to BFC 1909 Lux SPV, and Tacopina became the new club chairman.
The consortium "BFC 1909 Lux Spv".
Under the new ownership of which BFC 1909 Lux Spv S.A. of Luxembourg is an intermediate holding company, Bologna was promoted back to Serie A in 2015. Saputo also succeeded Tacopina as the new chairman of the board of directors of Bologna on 17 November 2014.
In their first season back in Serie A, Bologna finished 14th avoiding relegation. In the following two seasons, Bologna finished in 15th place on the table. In the 2018-19 Serie A season, Bologna finished in a creditable 10th position on the table.
Over the next three seasons, Bologna continued to finish mid-table in Serie A, coming in twelfth position for two campaigns in a row, followed by a thirteenth-place finish in the 2021–2022 season.
Stadium.
The official stadium of Bologna is the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara. Dall'Ara is the biggest sports building of Bologna and its name is taken from an ex-chairman of the club, Renato Dall'Ara, who died three days before the final for Serie A's "Scudetto". Its capacity is 38,500. The "curva Bulgarelli" (in English, Bulgarelli curve), the curve of Bologna's ultras, is dedicated to player Giacomo Bulgarelli, who died on 21 February 2009. The other curve, part of which is reserved for the away fans, is dedicated to Árpád Weisz, coach of Bologna's winning pre-war team, and killed by the Nazis in a concentration camp during the Second World War.

LFA Reggio Calabria

Football club based in Reggio Calabria, Italy
Football club
La Fenice Amaranto Reggio Calabria, commonly referred to as Reggina, is an Italian football club based in Reggio Calabria. They play their home matches at the 27,763 seater Stadio Oreste Granillo and are currently playing in the Serie D league.
They are nicknamed the "Amaranto" (amaranth) after their official dark red colours. The club was formerly known as Reggina Calcio before declaring bankruptcy in 2015, as well as A.S.D. Reggio Calabria in the 2015–16 season, Urbs Reggina 1914 from 2016 to 2019, Reggina 1914 from 2019 to 2023, and LFA Reggio Calabria from 2023.
In its previous guise, the club played in the Serie A for nine seasons between 1999 and 2009, including a seven-year consecutive spell starting in 2002. During these years, the club narrowly avoided relegation in most seasons and never finished in the top half. After failing to make a return in the first few years the club fell into financial and sporting difficulties, culminating in falling into the lower tiers of Italian football before returning to the Serie B in 2020.
Names.
The club was founded on 11 January 1914 as Unione Sportiva Reggio Calabria. It changed name many times (Società Calcistica Reggio, Reggio Foot Ball Club, Associazione Sportiva Reggina, Società Sportiva La Dominante), finally assuming the denomination Reggina Calcio in 1986.
After the 2015 bankruptcy, the club had used A.S.D. Reggio Calabria as the new name of the new legal person, and then the club changed to the denomination Urbs Reggina 1914 S.r.l. in 2016, and, between 2019 and 2023, Reggina 1914 S.r.l..
Following the most recent club exclusion in 2023, the club was refounded as LFA Reggio Calabria.
History.
The club was founded on 11 January 1914.
Serie A (1999–2009).
In the late 1990s to 2000s, Reggina have been alternating between the top two levels of the Italian league system. They reached the Italian top division Serie A for the first time in 1999. Two years later, they lost a relegation playout to Verona, being consequently relegated to 2001–02 Serie B. Reggina finished third in Serie B in 2002, earning a return to Serie A. In 2003, Reggina survived a relegation playout against Atalanta. They would spend the next 7 years maintaining their Serie A status until their eventual relegation in the 2008–09 season.
In August 2006, they were indicted as part of the second wave of "Calciopoli" investigations. Originally punished with a 15-point deduction for the 2006–07 Serie A, then reduced to 11 points following appeal. Despite the heavy deduction of points, Reggina managed to save themselves from relegation, defeating newly crowned UEFA Champions League winners Milan on the final matchday and ending the season with 40 points (including the deduction), just one single point above the third relegation spot, occupied by Chievo. They poorly started the Serie A 2007-08, causing head coach Massimo Ficcadenti to be sacked and replaced by Renzo Ulivieri. A third managerial change, with Ulivieri fired and replacing with team scout Nevio Orlandi, proved to be successful as Reggina improved their results and performances, escaping relegation with key wins at Catania, and home to Empoli. Orlandi was subsequently confirmed at the helm of the "amaranto" for the Serie A 2008–09.
Serie B (2009–2014).
Since their relegation in 2008–09 season, Reggina has become slightly inconsistent in their attempts to return to Italy's top flight. The 2009–10 season would see three coaches at the helm; Walter Novellino, Ivo Iaconi, Roberto Breda. Despite possessing Bonazzoli, Carmona, Tedesco, Brienza and home grown star Missiroli they were unable to gain a better position than 13th. Disappointing for a team just relegated from the top division. Top goal scorer for the campaign was Brienza with 12.
The 2010–11 season was regarded as one of the Amaranto's best in Serie B. Shockingly they would conduct their usual coaching merry go round, as Gianluca Atzori would lead them to a 6th-place finish and playoffs to Serie A. they would stumble at the last hurdle losing to Novara in a two legged play off. Top players include; Acerbi, Missiroli, Tedesco, Brienza, Bonazzoli (C) and Milan Loanee Adiyiah. Top goal scorer: Bonazzoli with 19 goals
The 2011–12 season was another disappointing season from the Amaranto, with a 12th-placed finish. Two coaches took charge of Reggina this season; Roberto Breda initially, before being sacked and replaced by Angelo Gregucci, only to be replaced by Breda again towards the end of the season. Unlike the previous season they did not make the play-offs. Top players in this season's squad include: Adejo, Emerson, (Ramos Borges Emerson), Missiroli, Bonazzoli (C), and Ceravolo. Top scorer was Ceravolo with 11.
The 2012–13 season would be marred with yet another controversy similar to that of 2006. Reggina were penalised for the latest match fixing scandal that hit Italian shores and were given a −4 penalty as a result. After appeal it was reduced to −2 instead. They were in contention for playoff places right until the last few rounds where poor form saw them end the season in 11th place.
The 2013–14 season ended in disaster, as Reggina won just six out of 42 games and finished second bottom, resulting in relegation to Lega Pro. The season also marked Foti's retirement from his role as president, who was handed over to Giuseppe Ranieri.
Lega Pro.
For the club's 2014–15 Lega Pro campaign, Reggina began the season with former captain Francesco Cozza as head coach. After a difficult start to the season and two coaching changes, youth team coach and former player Giacomo Tedesco was hired as head coach for the final three weeks of the season. Despite winning two of the final three matches, Reggina finished last in the league and would have to rely on an appeal of their point penalty to lift them out of the relegation zone. The appeal was successful and 2 points were returned to move them out of last place. Tedesco guided the team to survival in the playout over rivals Messina.
Serie D one-year stint.
Despite avoiding relegation in the 2014–15 season, Reggina failed to meet the deadline to register for Lega Pro and the club declared bankruptcy. A new legal person of the club, "A.S.D. Reggio Calabria", was formed to play in Serie D for the 2015–16 season, Reggio Calabria ended the season in 4th place, losing in the first round of playoffs against Cavese. During the season the club also re-incorporated from "associazione sportiva dilettantistica" to "società sportiva dilettantistica a responsabilità limitata" legal form.
Reggio Calabria was owned by Mimmo Praticò, former regional president of CONI.
Back to Serie C.
In June 2016, it was reported that the club was renamed from "S.S.D. Reggio Calabria a r.l." to "S.S.D. Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914 a r.l.". The club was then renamed as Urbs Reggina 1914 S.r.l.
Despite finishing as the losing side of the first round of the promotion playoffs of 2015–16 Serie D, the club filed for Lega Pro (later renamed Serie C) repechage to fill one of the vacancies for the 2016–17 season and was successfully admitted. Reggina ended the season in 13th place.
In January 2019, facing a crisis with a potential player strike due to non-payment of salaries, the club was sold to Italian entrepreneur Luca Gallo.
On 1 July 2019, the club announced to change the name to "Reggina 1914 S.r.l.".
Serie B return.
Reggina won its Serie C group in 2020, earning a promotion back to the Serie B for the upcoming season. The team upon its Serie B return included experienced players from higher levels including Jérémy Ménez and Germán Denis.
In the 2022-23 season under the guidance of manager Filippo Inzaghi, Reggina finished in a playoff position, despite being given a five point deduction for failing to pay taxes and player salaries on time. The deduction was initially seven points, but was reduced to five following an appeal.
2023 exclusion and restart.
On 1 July 2023, Reggina was excluded from Serie B for the 2023-24 season after Covisoc rejected their application due to financial irregularities. On appeal, the Federal Council confirmed Reggina's exclusion. The following level of appeal, the "Collegio di Garanzia" of the Italian Olympic Committee, withheld the decision. On 3 August, the Administrative Court of Rome again rejected Reggina's request for readmission. On 30 August, Reggina was again rejected at the final level of appeals, the Council of State. Brescia was readmitted to the league after the confirmed exclusion of Reggina.
On 1 September 2023, acting mayor of the Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria, Paolo Brunetti, received approval from the Italian Football Federation to enroll a club in Serie D for the 2023–24 season. The club was successively handed over to a Catania-based consortium led by Antonino Ballarino, named La Fenice Amaranto (The amaranth phoenix), which submitted a league application and will take part to the season under the new denomination of LFA Reggio Calabria, as the new club was forbidden to use the Reggina 1914 name or logo for the upcoming season.
Rivalries.
Reggina are fierce rivals with neighbours Messina, who are just a twenty-minute ferry ride apart from each other. Twice every season they play the "Derby dello Stretto" (Strait of Messina Derby). In the 2014–15 season, Reggina defeated Messina in both legs of the playout to send Messina down to Serie D. There is also a major Calabrian derby between Reggina and Crotone, but both teams have not played in the same league in for two years. Reggina also has a derby with fellow Calabrian team Catanzaro, which is currently in Serie B.
Colours and badges.
Reggina used a logo with a letter R and a football on it. Some variant of the logo, had 1986, the year of foundation of Reggina Calcio on it. Due to 2015 bankruptcy, the new owner introduced a new logo as the old design was tied to the old legal person of the club. Due to 2016 renaming, some modification was introduced, which a letter R was re-introduced in the logo. However, the design of the ball on the 2016 logo was different from the historical logo, which the 2016 logo used a leather ball. In 2019, the club reverted to use the historical design of the logo.
